Biological processors are groundbreaking systems made from living cells, a feat previously unaccomplished in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Swiss biocomputing startup Final Spark, founded in 2014, is the first in the world to build a living processor from living neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## What is a Human Brain Organoid?

A human brain organoid is essentially a small fragment of nervous tissue composed of neurons derived from humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. While many researchers globally work on human brain organoids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, what makes Final Spark unique is their purpose: using these organoids for computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This approach is based on the assumption that human neurons can be used for computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Creation and Cultivation of Organoids

Human cells are purchased from specialized companies that produce pluripotent stem cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. These cells are typically derived from fibroblasts (skin cells) that are reprogrammed to a state of pluripotency, meaning they can develop into any cell type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Differentiation into Neurons
Methods exist to differentiate skin cells into neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Specific molecules in the culture medium are used to induce these pluripotent stem cells to transform into neurons, astrocytes, and other types of brain cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The cells then reorganize themselves into three-dimensional structures that functionally resemble parts of the fetal brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Sustaining Organoid Life
Organoids are grown in an incubator under precise conditions of temperature (37 degrees Celsius like the human body) and carbon dioxide concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. They are nourished with a special culture medium containing nutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. A flow system with tubes and a pump ensures the growing medium continuously flows under the organoid, aiding survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Some organoids are kept on an orbital shaker to facilitate nutrient and oxygen entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The most challenging aspect has been keeping them alive; initially, they would die within hours, but now they can be sustained for weeks, and even almost 3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## Neural Activity and Communication

Organoids are connected to a neural platform by placing them on a multi-electrode array (MEA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This allows for recording their activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The MEA helps position the organoid precisely and reduces system noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. The moment neuronal activity was successfully recorded was "amazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

### The Butterfly Experiment
The butterfly experiment demonstrates real-time interaction with brain organoids for browser-based users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Concept**: A virtual butterfly moves in 3D, and its flight direction is controlled by interacting with the organoids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Stimulation**: When the butterfly "sees" light (represented by blue dots), stimulation is sent to the organoids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Response**: If the organoid responds to the stimulation, the butterfly flies straight towards the light; if not, it moves randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **Neural Burst**: A response appears as a "large wave" or "burst" of activity, indicating many neurons communicating and transmitting information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Communication**: This system demonstrates successful communication established with the organoids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### Information Processing and Learning
To get neurons to process information and enforce behavior, researchers use strategies such as rewarding organoids with dopamine when they perform a desired action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Observing the neural tissue response to dopamine, with a wave of activity typical of dopamine-induced stimulation, was a significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. This is considered "learning" in the context of biocomputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Energy Efficiency

The primary motivation for developing biological processors was the unsustainable energy consumption of artificial [[neural_networks_and_biological_systems|neural networks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Contrast with AI**: Simulations of 100 neurons in artificial [[neural_networks_and_biological_systems|neural networks]] can consume several kilowatts of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. In contrast, the human brain, with 86 billion neurons, requires only 20 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: Biological processors are by far the most energy-efficient method, with a difference described as a millionth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Implication**: This efficiency drastically reduces the carbon footprint of AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

## The Future of Computing

Biocomputing is seen as the future of data processing, particularly for artificial intelligence calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Just as quantum computers are specialized, biocomputing can be used for specific computational types, where AI fits perfectly because it is based on neuron simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. This project has attracted dozens of universities and has the potential to transform AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

### Ethical Considerations
Final Spark acknowledges the ethical concerns surrounding the use of living neurons for computational purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. They have established contacts with universities and ethics experts, attending conferences to introduce ethicists to their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

### Why Human Cells?
While rat cells could potentially work for computations, human cells are preferred for [[development_of_biological_processors_using_living_cells|development of biological processors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. This choice is driven by the potential for future therapeutic applications that could directly benefit people, rather than rats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

The National Laboratory of Atomic and Molecular Physics in Toruń is at the forefront of [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology | quantum physics]] research, focusing on [[technological_advancements_in_oled_and_light_screens | developing modern technologies]], primarily laser technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>. These advancements are crucial for testing [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology | quantum theory]] at atomic and molecular levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>.

## Ultra-Precise and Ultra-Stable Lasers

Researchers are developing ultra-precise and ultra-stable lasers to test [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science and_technology | quantum theory]] on a molecular scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>. By using visible or near-visible light, they achieve enormous measurement accuracy, enabling them to study the standard model without requiring very high energy inputs, but rather extremely high accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Optical Atomic Clocks

Optical atomic clocks are a key application of these [[technological_advancements_in_oled_and_light_screens | technologies]], utilized at the Institute of Physics in Toruń for research, including the study of fundamental constants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. These clocks define time with extreme precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Cryogenic Laser and Photonic Technologies

A significant aspect of current research involves transferring laser and photonic technologies to the cryogenic temperature regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>. This includes conducting the coldest measurements of molecular hydrogen to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, aiming to see if [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology | quantum theory]] extends beyond atomic physics to molecular physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## Trapping Molecular Hydrogen

One of the most challenging applications is the [[potential_applications_of_quasiparticles_in_technology | trapping]] of molecular hydrogen, which no one has successfully achieved on Earth so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. Molecular hydrogen is the smallest and simplest molecule in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>. It interacts extremely weakly with electric and magnetic fields, making conventional laser cooling and [[potential_applications_of_quasiparticles_in_technology | trapping]] techniques, which work for many atoms and molecules, unsuitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>.

To overcome this, researchers are developing ultra-modern experimental [[technological_advancements_in_oled_and_light_screens | technologies]] that are pushing the physical limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. This high-risk project requires mastering [[technological_advancements_in_oled_and_light_screens | technologies]] to their physical boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.

### Ultra-Strong Laser Fields and Optical Cavities

The solution involves creating an ultra-strong laser field using an optical cavity with ultra-high finesse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>. This setup allows photons to remain trapped between two mirrors for macroscopic periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. The average power of these photons can reach levels of single megawatts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>.

This [[potential_applications_of_quasiparticles_in_technology | trapping]] method is crucial because it allows for the isolation of the [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology | quantum system]] from the environment, enabling extremely precise measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>. The ability to [[potential_applications_of_quasiparticles_in_technology | trap]] molecular hydrogen will open the way for applying a cascade of cold atom and molecule physics [[technological_advancements_in_oled_and_light_screens | technologies]] to this simplest molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>. This will allow for testing [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology | quantum theory]] at a very high level of accuracy using a simple, countable system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.

The process involves generating an ultra-strong configuration of laser and electric fields to hold the molecular hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>. Almost 1 MW of continuous optical power will be trapped between two mirrors with an ultra-high reflectivity coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>. Special cryogenic modules within the vacuum chamber isolate the system from temperature and blackbody radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:00">[20:43:00]</a>. Hydrogen molecules, in very small amounts, will levitate inside this cryogenic vacuum chamber, detected by an extremely strong ultraviolet pulse that causes ionization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>. Levitation means the laser forces are strong enough to prevent the molecule from escaping thermally or gravitationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:00">[21:26:00]</a>.

## Funding and Impact

The total budget for this project is approximately 20 million zlotys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>, supported by an almost 2 million euro European grant, which is one of the largest individual research projects in physics in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>. This endeavor is considered one of the biggest tests of [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology | quantum theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:00">[21:59:00]</a>.

Evolutionary algorithms are designed to mimic the theory of evolution, specifically [[molecular_darwinism_and_evolution | Darwin's theory of natural selection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:20">[01:30:20]</a>. These algorithms are employed to identify a unit or object that possesses the optimal characteristics based on predefined criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[01:41:43]</a>.

## How Evolutionary Algorithms Work
The process typically involves:
1.  **Defining a Goal** The algorithm starts with a specific problem to solve, such as creating an "ideal" table based on defined criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>.
2.  **Population Creation** A "population" of many units (e.g., tables) is generated, each slightly differing from the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>.
3.  **Modification/Mutation** These units undergo a phase of modification or mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
4.  **Selection** The tables that best meet the initial criteria are selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
5.  **Iteration** This process is repeated iteratively with the expectation that over time, the generated units will increasingly approach the "ideal" solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

This approach can be likened to a "game of life," where algorithms, including [[neural_networks_and_biological_systems | artificial neural networks]], attempt to replicate or simulate natural life processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:20">[02:29:20]</a>. However, not all algorithms designed to solve problems (such as sentence completion) necessarily incorporate an evolutionary element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

The question of what [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | consciousness]] is has been a subject of inquiry for decades, and its potential relationship with [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | artificial intelligence]] (AI) remains a key area of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Neural Networks and Biological Systems

Advanced AI systems utilize neural networks that are most interesting due to how they distinguish themselves from biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A potential future direction for AI development involves incorporating neural networks into biological fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, sharing concerns and merits between biology and the abstract world of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Neurons: Independent or Collective?
A fundamental question is whether neurons should be viewed as independent systems or as elements exhibiting collective behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Capturing the "essence" of a phenomenon, rather than all its details, is crucial for understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Slavishly copying every tiny aspect of biology in AI has proven less advantageous than imitating the essence, which conserves computational resources and provides deeper insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

This approach aligns with Phil Anderson's idea that "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Understanding brain activity shifted from tracking individual neuron action potentials to visualizing the dynamics of large systems in multidimensional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### The Role of Computation
Early research into neural networks involved dealing with computation in physical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. It's suggested that computation doesn't need to be limited solely to logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The realization that memory in biology and psychology is isomorphic to claims physicists make about spin and magnetism led to creating models that combine these similar concepts more coherently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Consciousness: Classical or Quantum?
The question of whether [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | human consciousness]] belongs to the realm of quantum physics or classical mechanics is debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. While some, like Roger Penrose, strongly believe it arises from quantum phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>, it cannot be ruled out that [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | consciousness]] is a problem of classical mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. The decision on the role of quantum mechanics is secondary; it could be either way unless the relationship of consciousness to something else is understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

> "We cannot rule out the possibility that [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | consciousness]] is a problem of classical mechanics and not quantum mechanics." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>

## Evolution of AI and Future Prospects
The development of AI has been a gradual process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Key milestones include:
*   Early neural networks (one neuron, perceptron) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   Hopfield networks with feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
*   Boltzmann machines with more complex topological networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   Deep learning, which enabled learning in multi-layered networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

The focus shifted from understanding hidden knowledge in networks to learning, largely driven by figures like Hinton and Sejnowski <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. The future of [[artificial_intelligence_development_and_control | neural network development]] over the next decade is uncertain, depending on which dynamic model of neuronal activity comes to dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

### Concerns and Societal Impact
Concerns exist, expressed by figures like Geoffrey Hinton, that [[artificial_intelligence_development_and_control | AI could destroy humanity]] and requires supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. However, the speaker distinguishes between wiping out the human race and destroying all DNA- and RNA-based life, emphasizing they are not the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. [[Artificial_intelligence_and_societal_impact | Social surprises]] from AI are anticipated, suggesting that better accounting for how society functions could lead to discoveries being seen as tools rather than threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is for [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | AI to become what society needs]] and to better understand how biology performs its extraordinary calculations with surprisingly few computational resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

### The Nobel Prize and Broader Physics
The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics for fundamental discoveries enabling machine learning using neural networks highlights the field's importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. However, it is seen as limiting to view physics solely through the lens of AI, as physics encompasses all phenomena in matter and does not like to be confined to "tight pigeonholes" <a class="yt=" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. There is a hope that future recognition will emphasize broader scientific understanding over mere engineering efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

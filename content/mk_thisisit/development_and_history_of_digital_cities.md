Professor Andrzej Targowski, a pioneer of Polish computer science, is recognized as the father of one of the first [[digital_and_organic_immortality|digital]] cities in the history of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. His work on this concept significantly predates the widespread popularization of the Internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## The Kalamazoo Tele City Project

Professor Targowski implemented the concept of a [[digital_and_organic_immortality|digital]] city as part of the "Tele City of Kalamazoo" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, also referred to as "Kalamazoo City of Camu" or "Tele City of Kalamu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

### Location and Significance
The project was located in Kalamazoo, on the East Coast of the United States, near Chicago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. It is considered the first American [[digital_and_organic_immortality|digital]] project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>, developed in parallel with Chicago Online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

### Implementation and Goals
Professor Targowski undertook this project during a sabbatical year, which is a paid leave granted to professors in America every six or seven years for focused project work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. He worked within the Kalamazoo City Hall, which employed 1000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

He established a computing center using his students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. A primary objective was to implement a form of the National IT System (KSI) infrastructure, a concept he had previously tried to implement in Poland without success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. Specifically, he aimed to connect schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

The project received significant government funding, with Professor Targowski having approximately 3 million dollars in the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. However, project applications and calculations had to be done for free as they fell under scientific research, funded by government grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

### Public Engagement and Impact
As part of the initiative, Professor Targowski conducted courses on websites, introducing enterprises to the concept of having their own websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. He noted that initially, people, including enterprise representatives, did not understand the concept of a website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. However, slow but steady adoption occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. Graduates of these courses later created private networks, with one even becoming a millionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.

### Comparison with Parallel Developments
While the Kalamazoo project was underway, "Chicago Online" was also being created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. From Chicago Online, "America Online" was later developed as a closed platform requiring a login and password for online calculations and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

## Professor Targowski's Broader Contributions to Information Systems

Professor Targowski's work on [[digital_and_organic_immortality|digital]] cities is part of his broader contributions to information systems and [[technological_advancements_and_societal_impact|technological advancements]].

### The PESEL System
Professor Targowski is considered the father of the Polish PESEL system, a national information system with a PESEL area concept that has survived to this day, though not fully implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. This system, drawing inspiration from similar concepts in the United States and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, was intended to serve as a basis for information exchange between national systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. He proposed the PESEL system to the Minister of Internal Affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Information Highway Concept
Eleven years before the Internet was popularized, Professor Targowski developed a project for a fast Internet information highway, later termed "Highway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This concept was developed around 1972, while the Internet became popular around 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

### Strategic Informatics
Professor Targowski emphasizes that strategic informatics involves more than just applications and programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. He believes that in a world of changing values, the constant elements are databases and data transmission networks, which form a stabilized infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. He critiques the current state where [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence|artificial intelligence]] is taking over programming, leading to a "dying profession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. He argues that computer science should support, not attack, humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

### Philosophy on Knowledge and Wisdom
Professor Targowski concludes with an appeal for wisdom, stating that "knowledge is not wisdom, but the ability to apply knowledge is wisdom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. He advocates for thinking both vertically (specialized knowledge) and horizontally (general knowledge and context) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>, believing that much [[technological_advancements_and_societal_impact|innovation]] occurs at the intersections of fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

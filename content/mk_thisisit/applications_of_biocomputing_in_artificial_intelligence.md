[[The convergence of AI and human biology | Biological processors]], made from living cells, represent a groundbreaking advancement, with no historical precedent in their creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. These processors are grown on special plates to form three-dimensional structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This method is the most energy-efficient known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, being about a million times more efficient than traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Final Spark: Pioneering Biocomputing

Final Spark, a Swiss biocomputing startup founded in 2014, is the first in the world to build a living processor from living neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The company aims to combine the [[the_importance_of_computing_power_in_ai_research | computing power]] of traditional computers with the efficiency of the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Human Brain Organoids
A human brain organoid is a small fragment of nervous tissue composed of neurons derived from humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While many institutions worldwide work on human brain organoids, Final Spark's unique contribution is their application for computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The core assumption is that human neurons can be used for computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

The human cells used are pluripotent stem cells, typically derived from fibroblasts (skin cells) that are reprogrammed to a state of pluripotency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This allows them to become any cell type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Specific molecules are added to the culture medium to differentiate these pluripotent stem cells into neurons, astrocytes, and other brain cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Organoids are grown in an incubator under precise conditions of temperature and carbon dioxide concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. They are supplied with a special culture medium containing nutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> and maintained in a flow system with a pump circulating the medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The internal temperature is kept at 37 degrees Celsius, like the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Final Spark has successfully kept these cells alive for almost three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Connecting Organoids to Neural Platforms
Organoids are placed directly onto a multi-electrode array (MEA) to record their activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. A membrane with a hole, called "confetti," helps position the organoid precisely and reduces system noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Driving Force: Energy Efficiency for AI
The decision to pursue biocomputing stemmed from the energy consumption of [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | artificial neural networks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Simulations of 100 neurons in traditional [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | AI]] systems can consume several kilowatts of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. In stark contrast, the human brain, with 86 billion neurons, requires only 20 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This massive disparity highlighted the need for a more sustainable approach to [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | AI]] development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The main motivation was fundamental research on [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | artificial intelligence]], realizing that using living neurons was the best way to advance it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Demonstrating Biocomputing Capabilities: The Butterfly Experiment
The "butterfly experiment" allows browser-based users to interact directly and in real-time with brain organoids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Users send stimulation to the organoids, which is visually represented by a blue dot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. A butterfly on screen moves in three dimensions, and its flight direction is controlled by the organoid's response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. If the butterfly responds to stimulation, it flies straight; if not, it moves randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This experiment demonstrates the communication established with the organoids, showing bursts of activity where multiple neurons transmit information and process it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

To induce information processing and enforce specific behaviors (learning), Final Spark uses dopamine to reward a brain organoid when it performs a desired action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Future Implications and Challenges
Biocomputing is seen as the future of data processing, particularly for [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | artificial intelligence]] calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Similar to how quantum computers have specific applications, biocomputing can be used for particular types of computations, with [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | AI]] fitting perfectly due to its neural network basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. This technology has the potential to transform [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | AI]] development and drastically reduce its carbon footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

### Ethical Considerations
Final Spark acknowledges the [[ethical_considerations_in_biocomputing | ethical issues]] surrounding their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. While the scientists focus on technical questions, they engage with universities and ethics experts to consider the implications of using living neurons for computational purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

### Why Human Cells?
While rat cells could potentially work for computations, the use of human cells opens up the possibility for future therapeutic applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. The company prefers that any discoveries made along the way could help people rather than just rats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

Key milestones for the company include successfully recording neuronal activity, growing cells from liquid nitrogen, and observing neural tissue responses to dopamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. The most challenging aspect has been simply keeping the cells alive, which was initially only possible for a few hours but now for weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. The CEO of Final Spark, Fred, previously worked on [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | artificial neural networks]] but shifted focus to biocomputing, believing that the solution for [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | AI]] advancements lies in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

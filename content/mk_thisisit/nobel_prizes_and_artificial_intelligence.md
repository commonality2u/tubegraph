The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, located in a building where Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry, and economics are awarded, recently hosted a press conference where the future of [[artificial_intelligence_progress_and_future | Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) was a central topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The fundamental question addressed was whether strong [[artificial_intelligence_and_future_prospects | Artificial Intelligence]] will ever come into being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Dawn of [[superintelligence_in_artificial_intelligence | Superintelligence]]

Both Professor Jeff Hinton, considered the "father of neural networks," and Demis Hassabis of DeepMind, believe that [[superintelligence_in_artificial_intelligence | superintelligence]] will be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26">[02:26]</a>. This is not seen as an exaggeration or a marketing ploy, but a long-held belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

They predict that something akin to [[superintelligence_in_artificial_intelligence | superintelligence]] could emerge within 5 to 20 years, with Demis Hassabis suggesting it could be as soon as 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41">[02:41]</a>. This rapid progress means humanity must seriously consider how to maintain control over such a powerful technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48">[02:48]</a>.

## Regrets and Risks

Professor Jeff Hinton expressed regret not in the sense of guilt, but rather unfortunate circumstances, wishing he had considered the security issues related to [[superintelligence_in_artificial_intelligence | superintelligence]] earlier, as it is likely to arrive sooner than he anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57">[01:57]</a>.

Demis Hassabis, who founded DeepMind in 2010, stated that his passion has always been to use [[artificial_intelligence_and_future_prospects | AI]] for scientific discoveries, particularly in areas like disease treatment, energy, and climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10">[03:10]</a>. However, he acknowledges the inherent risks of such a powerful technology, emphasizing the need to take them "extremely seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28">[03:28]</a>. There is limited time to conduct research on the interpretation and control of these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44">[03:44]</a>.

## Regulation and Accessibility

The challenge of regulating [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | AI]] is significant due to its rapid development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07">[05:07]</a>. Governments and social organizations are advised to create flexible regulations, perhaps building upon existing frameworks in areas like healthcare or transport, and dynamically adapting them to technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16">[05:16]</a>.

A direct threat of [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | AI]] is autonomous lethal weapons, which current European regulations explicitly exclude from military applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23">[04:23]</a>. This leads to an [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | AI]] arms race among nations such as the United States, China, Russia, Great Britain, and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43">[04:43]</a>.

To promote fairness and prevent discrimination, DeepMind makes many of its tools and research results available as open source or easily accessible, making the technology increasingly democratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01">[06:01]</a>.

## [[Artificial_intelligence_and_future_prospects | AI]] in Scientific Discovery

AI is described as a "new type of microscope" that offers a novel perspective on reality, with its results confirmed through experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22">[06:22]</a>. It is increasingly seen as a key stage, or even the main element, of scientific research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42">[06:42]</a>.

Nobel Prizes, however, will not be awarded simply for using [[artificial_intelligence_and_future_prospects | AI]]; they will continue to recognize actual discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50">[06:50]</a>. For example, future Nobel Prizes might be awarded for breakthroughs in understanding cell function enabled by [[artificial_intelligence_and_future_prospects | AI]] tools like AlphaFold, which predicts protein structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00">[07:00]</a>.

Deep learning methods, while powerful, require vast and well-prepared datasets. The success in protein structure prediction, for instance, relied on decades of experimental research and billions of dollars in investment to create detailed protein data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19">[07:19]</a>. The future development of [[artificial_intelligence_and_future_prospects | AI]] in science will depend on the creation of similarly rich datasets in other fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56">[07:56]</a>.

## Nobel Recognition for [[Artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | AI]]

Professor David Baker, a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, highlighted that the recent Nobel Prizes serve as "undoubtedly evidence of the enormous influence of [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | Artificial Intelligence]]" across various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21">[09:21]</a>. While his own work predates the [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | AI]] era, the design methods developed in recent years are based on its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28">[09:28]</a>. This year's awards notably emphasized technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44">[09:44]</a>.

Professor Baker emphasized that while technology provides tools, it is people who identify problems and drive the solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56">[09:56]</a>. Identifying problems solvable by designing new proteins requires human intuition and approach, which computers cannot provide independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17">[10:17]</a>.

The 2023 Nobel Prize ceremony was unique because it awarded individuals like the creators of AlphaFold/DeepMind, who are young and whose research is very recent, unlike the traditional decades-long wait for recognition of scientific achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30">[10:30]</a>. This reflects a shift in how the Nobel Committee acknowledges the impact of technology on humanity's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48">[10:48]</a>.

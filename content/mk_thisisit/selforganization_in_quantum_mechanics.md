Self-organization refers to the spontaneous arrangement of a many-body system into a regular, ordered structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. While commonly observed in space, such as in physical crystals like diamonds or table salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, physicists are exploring whether similar phenomena can occur in the time dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Self-Organization in Spatial Crystals

In well-known spatial crystals, self-organization leads to regular structures in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. When energy is lowered (e.g., by cooling), atoms, due to their interactions, prefer to arrange themselves into a regular structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This means that atoms can spontaneously organize into something regular if the right conditions are created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

This phenomenon is tied to the concept of spontaneous breaking of symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. While the equations of [[quantum_mechanics_and_consciousness | quantum mechanics]] often prefer symmetry, sometimes stationary solutions do not follow this symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. For spatial crystals, instead of a smeared, uniform distribution of atoms (which symmetry might suggest), self-organization leads to a regular, ordered pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Self-Organization in Time Crystals

The concept of self-organization can be extended to the time dimension, leading to time crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. A time crystal is a system of many bodies that spontaneously sets itself into periodic motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This is distinct from classical periodic motion, such as a clock pendulum, which is an expected regularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The key is the *spontaneous* nature of this periodic motion, especially when it is not directly caused by an external periodic force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

Frank Wilczek, a Nobel Prize winner, first posed the question in 2012 whether a time crystal could be created where a many-body system enters periodic motion in its lowest energy state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. He asked if spontaneous breaking of symmetry could occur with respect to shifts in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, meaning a system with time-independent continuous translational symmetry in time could produce a discrete translational symmetry in time, resulting in periodic motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. While Wilczek's initial mechanism was found to be flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, his brilliant idea spurred new research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

Professor Krzysztof Sacha is credited with the first description of "discrete time crystals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. His approach involved a multi-body system disturbed by a periodically changing force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. In this scenario, the system begins to evolve periodically with a *different* period than the driving force, a spontaneous emergence of a new periodic motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This type of time crystal has been experimentally realized by groups at the University of Maryland and Harvard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

## Self-Organization and the Nature of Quantum Mechanics

The concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking in self-organization highlights a fascinating aspect of [[quantum_mechanics_and_consciousness | quantum mechanics]]: "certain things that are basically natural they do not exist in quantum mechanics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. For example, in a system of ultracold atomic clouds, a motion where two clouds bounce alternately, which would be natural classically, does not exist in [[quantum_mechanics_and_consciousness | quantum mechanics]] for time crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Instead, a different crystal structure emerges in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

### [[impact_of_observation_in_quantum_mechanics | Impact of Observation]]

This phenomenon is also linked to the [[impact_of_observation_in_quantum_mechanics | impact of observation]] in [[quantum_mechanics_and_consciousness | quantum mechanics]]. When a system is described by a wave function, which holds maximum information about the system, observing or measuring a property (like position) changes the quantum state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. This is analogous to Schr√∂dinger's cat, where the act of observation collapses the superposition of states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. In time crystals, while a "Singer's cat" theoretical state might exist momentarily, it disappears if any question is asked about the quantum system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>, leading to the observation of periodic motion with a period different from the driving force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. However, once formed, time crystals are generally robust to repeated observations for certain types of information, not dramatically changing their state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

## Primitive vs. Complex Organization

The self-organization seen in both spatial and time crystals is considered a "very primitive self-organization" when compared to the complex organization required for the creation of an organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. The question of how consciousness arises from matter remains one of the most important unanswered questions in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

## Future Applications

While [[quantum_mechanics_and_consciousness | quantum mechanics]] begins to describe the world using probabilities, giving a sense of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, the field of time crystals is still young in terms of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. However, there are potential prospects, similar to how spatial crystals are universally used for their conductivity properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. Researchers are investigating if time crystals can exhibit analogous properties like conductivity, insulation, or superconductivity in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. The possibility of building quantum computers using time crystals is also being explored, showing promising theoretical results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

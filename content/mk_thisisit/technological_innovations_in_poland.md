Professor Andrzej Targowski, a pioneer of Polish computer science, is widely recognized as one of the fathers of Polish teleinformatics in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>. His work, influenced by his experiences and studies in Western computer science in France (1962-1964), laid crucial groundwork for Poland's technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:40">[13:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:30">[13:28:30]</a>.

## Key Contributions

### The PESEL System
Professor Targowski is known as the "father of the Polish PESEL system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. He conceived the National Information System, which included the PESEL area, in the early 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. The PESEL concept, a population register, was designed to serve as a basis for information exchange between national systems and was considered an early form of public internet for administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>.

The original idea for a national numbering system, called PESEL Security, was actually introduced by the President of the Republic of Poland in 1935 to manage economic crises and social benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. Professor Targowski, as the Deputy Head of the National IT Office responsible for all of Poland, was delegated to implement the modern PESEL system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

He developed an IT Development Program for 1971-1975, which included the PESEL system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:14">[11:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. Despite initial political resistance and approval of his system over an alternative, it faced implementation challenges and opposition from figures like Professor Turski from the University of Warsaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>.

### Information Highway Concept
Professor Targowski developed a project for a fast internet information highway 11 years before the internet was popularized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. This concept was inspired by his observations of the American IT landscape, particularly its perceived inefficiencies, leading him to advocate for more efficient use of fewer computers in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>.

## [[polands_representation_in_global_technology_hubs|Polish Influence on US Technology]]
Professor Targowski is recognized as the "father of the first digital city" in the history of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. He implemented the "Tele City of Kalamazoo" project in Michigan, near Chicago, during a sabbatical in the Kalamazoo city hall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This project aimed to connect schools and implement concepts he couldn't in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. He taught courses on website creation, which led to graduates building private networks and some becoming millionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:48">[02:48:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:56">[02:54:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_entrepreneurship_and_innovation_in_poland|Challenges and Criticisms of Polish Innovation]]
Professor Targowski expresses concern about the state of [[polish_culture_and_technological_innovation|technological innovation in Poland]], noting its significant lag behind other countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>.

### Digital Awareness and Patent Applications
According to Eurostat results on digital awareness, Poland ranks at the end of Europe, only ahead of Romania and Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:00">[30:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:42:00">[30:42:00]</a>. The number of new patent applications in Warsaw (around 177 per year) and Krakow (144 per year) is strikingly low compared to major research centers like Munich (9,000) or California (25,000-60,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59:00">[30:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:03:00">[31:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06:00">[31:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:00">[31:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:00">[31:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20:00">[31:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26:00">[31:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:32:00">[31:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45:00">[31:45:00]</a>. He describes the situation as "hopeless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:08:00">[32:08:00]</a>.

### [[scientific_progress_and_funding_in_poland|Higher Education and IT Curriculum]]
A major reason for this "hopeless" situation is the "tragic way of higher education" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39:00">[32:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:43:00">[32:43:00]</a>. Professor Targowski argues that Polish universities, including the University of Warsaw, primarily train programmers rather than system designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>. He compares this to building a house: you need an architect designer first, then plumbers and electricians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:00">[20:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>. He notes that the programmer profession is becoming obsolete due to artificial intelligence and outsourcing to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>.

He highlights a significant discrepancy in credit hours: American universities require 120 credit hours for computer science, while the Warsaw University of Technology requires only 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>. This leads to Polish engineers having limited practical experience, unlike their American counterparts who gain experience every summer semester <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:08:00">[33:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:12:00">[33:12:00]</a>.

Professor Targowski emphasizes the need for a shift from purely vertical, highly specialized thinking to a more horizontal approach, which involves understanding neighboring topics and broader contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:00">[33:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:46:00">[33:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31:00">[34:31:00]</a>. He notes that 60% of innovations occur in the digital environment, which is inherently horizontal, and that many innovations in fields like physics come from non-physicists who possess a broader perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:34:00">[35:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:00">[35:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:45:00">[35:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:51:00">[35:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:53:00">[35:53:00]</a>.

## The Human Element in Technology
Professor Targowski stresses that computer science should support humans, not attack or eliminate their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. He observes that current trends in innovation and automation are increasingly eliminating human work, leading to concerns about future societal impacts if not regulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

He appreciates modern Polish digital services like mobile ID cards and driving licenses, viewing them as valuable "point applications" that enhance visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. However, he cautions about the need to consider people who are not proficient in using these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

## Concluding Thoughts
Professor Targowski's ultimate message emphasizes the importance of wisdom over mere knowledge: "Knowledge is not wisdom, but the ability to apply knowledge is wisdom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. He believes that true progress lies in the power of reason and the effective application of what is known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

Wormholes represent a speculative concept in theoretical physics, often envisioned as tunnels through [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | spacetime]] itself. One interpretation suggests a kind of wormhole that "opens from the inside of the black hole to the outside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:06">[09:48:06]</a>, potentially allowing information to exit a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:24">[09:58:24]</a>. However, this is described as a "very speculative interpretation of difficult mathematics and there is no evidence for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:19">[10:04:19]</a>.

## Einstein-Rosen Bridges and Spacetime Geometry
The concept of the [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | Einstein-Rosen bridge]], also known as a wormhole, originated from the work of Einstein and Rosen in the mid-1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:07">[11:07:07]</a>. This idea stems from a property of [[classical_spacetime_and_gravity | spacetime]] discovered in 1916 concerning eternal black holes â€“ black holes that have always existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:59">[11:18:59]</a>.

A formal mathematical solution exists that includes a black hole, a white hole, and a [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | space-time tunnel]] connecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:41">[11:37:41]</a>. This describes the [[geometry_and_spacetime | geometry of space-time tunnels]] within the theory of relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:14">[11:54:14]</a>.

## Traversability and Stability
Despite their theoretical possibility, actual travel through these tunnels is problematic. It is currently believed that "you can't pass through it because of how it develops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:17">[11:46:17]</a>. To construct a stable [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | space-time tunnel]] that would allow for travel, forms of energy or matter are required that, "according to our knowledge, do not exist in the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:03">[12:00:03]</a>.

Physicists today largely agree that two documents published by Einstein around 100 years ago, including one related to Podolsky (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox), describe the same phenomenon: [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | space-time tunnels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:01">[12:26:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:40">[12:31:40]</a>. A [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | space-time tunnel]] formed by the merging of two black holes implies that these black holes must be "completely entangled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:09">[12:42:09]</a>.

Current knowledge suggests that while [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | space-time tunnels]] can theoretically exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:07">[13:05:07]</a>, those traversable for travel "probably do not exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:04">[13:10:04]</a>. The prevailing belief is that [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | space-time tunnels]] are unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:03">[13:16:03]</a>. It's not possible to "jump into this black hole from one side and jump out from the other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:02">[13:23:02]</a> due to "a certain time disruption inside" where "time and space changes places" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:20">[13:29:20]</a>. The main difficulty lies in maintaining the stability of such a tunnel to allow for exit on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:04">[13:37:04]</a>.

## Singularities and the Cosmic Censor Hypothesis
The concept of wormholes is intertwined with singularities, points of infinite density created by the collapse of matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:13">[09:05:13]</a>. The "cosmic censor hypothesis" suggests that all singularities must be hidden inside the [[black_holes_wormholes_and_the_information_paradox | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:07">[13:53:07]</a>, preventing direct observation of their nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>. However, whether every singularity must always be hidden by a horizon remains an "open problem" in both physics and mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:01">[14:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:01">[14:20:01]</a>. Understanding black holes, and by extension concepts like wormholes and singularities, is seen as crucial for making a "quantum leap in understanding the science of theoretical physics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:03">[14:34:03]</a>.

The creation and sustenance of human brain organoids represent a groundbreaking advancement in biotechnology, enabling the development of [[development_of_biological_processors_using_living_cells | biological processors]] from living cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Final Spark, a Swiss biocomputing startup founded in 2014, is notable as the world's first to build a living processor from living neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This approach aims to combine the computing power of traditional computers with the efficiency of the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## What is a Human Brain Organoid?

A human brain organoid is essentially a small fragment of nervous tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It is composed of neurons derived from human cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. While the concept of [[human_embryo_research_and_development | human brain organoids]] is not entirely new, with many researchers worldwide working on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, Final Spark's unique contribution lies in using them for computing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Functionally, these organoids are designed to resemble the fetal brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Creation Process

The process begins with obtaining human cells:
*   **Cell Sourcing** Companies specializing in cell production provide pluripotent stem cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Reprogramming** These stem cells are typically derived from fibroblasts (skin cells) that have been reprogrammed to a state of pluripotency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Pluripotency means they have the ability to become any type of cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Differentiation** Specific methods are used to differentiate these pluripotent stem cells into neurons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This involves adding particular molecules to the culture medium, signaling the cells to transform into neurons, astrocytes, and other brain cell types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **3D Structure Formation** The cells are grown on special plates that facilitate the formation of a three-dimensional structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Over time, these cells reorganize themselves into structures that resemble parts of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Sustaining Life

Keeping the organoids alive is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, as initially, they would die within a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Now, they can be maintained for weeks, even up to almost three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Key elements for sustaining brain organoids include:
*   **Culture Medium** A special pinkish culture medium provides essential nutrients for their survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Flow System** A continuous flow system, managed by tubes and a pump, ensures the growing medium circulates under the organoid at rates like 30-50 microliters per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Controlled Environment** Organoids are kept in an incubator with precise conditions, including a controlled atmosphere to ensure sufficient oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Temperature Regulation** The temperature inside the incubator is maintained at exactly 37 degrees Celsius, mirroring the human body's temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Orbital Shaker** Some organoids are placed on an orbital shaker, which helps nutrients and oxygen to penetrate the organoid more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Connecting to a Neural Platform

To facilitate computation, organoids are placed on a multi-electrode array (MEA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The organoid is positioned directly on the electrodes to record its activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. A membrane with a hole in the middle, referred to as "confetti," assists in precisely positioning the organoid in the center and helps reduce system noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Energy Efficiency and Purpose

The primary motivation for developing [[development_of_biological_processors_using_living_cells | biological processors]] is their remarkable energy efficiency compared to artificial neural networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. A simulation of 100 artificial neurons can consume several kilowatts of power, whereas the human brain, with 86 billion neurons, requires only 20 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This significant difference in energy consumption makes biocomputing a promising path for advanced [[neural_networks_and_biological_systems | artificial intelligence]] calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

The ability to record [[neural_activity_and_energy_efficiency_of_brain_organoids | neural activity]] from these organoids, as demonstrated by observable "bursts" of activity suggesting communication between neurons, was a key breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Researchers aim to induce specific behaviors, which they refer to as learning, often using substances like dopamine as a reward mechanism to encourage desired actions from the brain organoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations

The ethical implications of using living human neurons for computational purposes are recognized as a serious concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Final Spark actively engages with universities and ethics experts, attending conferences to present their work and allow those knowledgeable in the field to consider the societal implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. While rat cells could potentially be used for computations, human cells are preferred due to the potential for therapeutic applications that could directly benefit people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

Kacper Koniarski, responsible for the development of the Lewmo company, discussed how their new [[levitating_railway_technology | levitating railway]] system compares to other advanced transport technologies like Hyperloop and Maglev, particularly in the context of its [[integration_with_existing_railway_infrastructure | integration with existing railway infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>.

## Hyperloop

The concept of [[hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Hyperloop]] served as the foundational idea for Lewmo's technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:03">[09:34:03]</a>. [[hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Hyperloop]] envisions vehicles moving in a vacuum-sealed tube, eliminating aerodynamic drag, and using contactless drive and suspension systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:04">[09:47:04]</a>. This design aims to transport passengers at speeds approaching the speed of sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:04">[10:02:04]</a>.

Lewmo originated from a student team that participated in an Elon Musk competition for [[hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Hyperloop]], achieving a top 10 result among several hundred participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. However, the team realized that [[hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Hyperloop]] faces significant challenges, primarily high costs associated with rebuilding entire countries for its infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:07">[10:50:07]</a>.

Despite the challenges, Koniarski believes [[hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Hyperloop]] will be created, potentially around 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:49:57">[36:49:57]</a>. He suggests that the main hurdle is not feasibility but rather Europe's ability to accept and integrate such a system, requiring agreement from numerous member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:11:09">[37:11:09]</a>. He views [[hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Hyperloop]] as a good idea, especially if it can be connected to conventional rail systems, like Lewmo's technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:22:20">[38:22:20]</a>.

## Maglev

Maglev systems are described as "functionally twins" to [[hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Hyperloop]], but without the vacuum tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:40">[11:05:40]</a>. They also face two main problems:
*   **High Costs**: Similar to [[hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Hyperloop]], Maglev systems are very expensive to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:35">[11:12:35]</a>.
*   **Separated Systems**: Maglevs are typically isolated from existing infrastructure, requiring passengers to transfer to reach city centers, which negates some of the time savings achieved during travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:18">[11:18:18]</a>. This issue is likened to air travel, where time spent getting to and from airports significantly adds to the total journey time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:30">[11:51:30]</a>.

## Lewmo System: A Hybrid Approach

The core idea behind the Lewmo system was to leverage elements of [[hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Hyperloop]] technology but implement them on existing railway infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:05">[12:10:05]</a>. This approach addresses the major drawbacks of both [[hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Hyperloop]] and Maglev:
*   **Cost Efficiency**: By utilizing existing transport corridors, Lewmo avoids the high costs and time-consuming procedures associated with acquiring new land for infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:45">[12:22:45]</a>.
*   **Integration**: The system is designed to be an overlay on the existing railway network, allowing trains to retain access to city centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. This preserves the advantage of rail transport's direct connection to urban hubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:13">[12:35:13]</a>.

The Lewmo system involves installing new components, such as "levitation beams" (also called "levitation tables") outside the rails and a linear drive system in the middle of the infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:06">[03:27:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:05">[04:35:05]</a>. This allows for the use of new rolling stock that is lighter than conventional trains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:07">[04:09:07]</a>.

Lewmo's passive levitation technology generates a magnetic cushion, allowing the train to float a few centimeters above the tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:01">[02:22:01]</a>. This levitation force is a side effect of the vehicle's movement over aluminum plates integrated into the levitation beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:28">[03:10:28]</a>. The technology is patented globally, making Lewmo pioneers in this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>.

The target speed for the Lewmo system is up to 550 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>, which is comparable to the world record for Maglev (603 km/h) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:18">[05:27:18]</a>. This speed is achievable on straight lines or very long curves, while still allowing for a 40% speed increase in other curves compared to traditional rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

In terms of cost, revolutionizing a route like Kraków-Gdańsk (approx. 700 km) with Lewmo technology would cost about 500 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:03:00">[30:03:00]</a>. In contrast, building a Shinkansen (high-speed rail) infrastructure on the same route could cost between 50 and 150 million dollars per kilometer, leading to expenses in the tens of billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>. This highlights Lewmo's competitive advantage in implementation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:32:00">[30:32:00]</a>.

Kacper Koniarski describes Lewmo as a "Polish answer" or "European answer" to the "Chinese Railway Revolution," emphasizing their unique technology that integrates madlewo-derivative systems into existing European railway environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. The company aims for passenger transport by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>.

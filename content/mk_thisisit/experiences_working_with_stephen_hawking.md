The speaker first met [[collaborations_and_contributions_with_stephen_hawking|Stephen Hawking]] in the late 1990s while pursuing a PhD at Oxford, where Hawking was invited by [[sir_roger_penrose_and_his_contributions_to_physics|Roger Penrose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The relationship deepened when the speaker moved to Cambridge in 2003, at which point Hawking was still the head of their research group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. He led the Lucasian Department of Natural Sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Active Participation Despite Disability
Despite his disability, [[collaborations_and_contributions_with_stephen_hawking|Stephen Hawking]] actively participated in the scientific life of the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. He would come to the department two or three times a week, attend seminars as much as he could, and ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Nature of Collaboration
The speaker clarified that they never directly *worked* with [[collaborations_and_contributions_with_stephen_hawking|Stephen Hawking]], noting that very few people did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. It was suggested that perhaps no one truly understood what was going on in his head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Hawking communicated using a laptop screen, which he operated with a finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. When asking him questions, it was important to give him time to type his answers rather than trying to guess what he wanted to say, as guessing made him nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Due to his speech method, he spoke very little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

While he had doctoral students with whom he worked more closely, even then, a professor often acted as an intermediary to facilitate communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Occasionally, every few months, he would initiate a conversation by knocking on a door to discuss various topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

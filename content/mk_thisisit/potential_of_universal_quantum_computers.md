The development of universal quantum computers is a significant area of research and engineering, with the potential to [[the_potential_of_quantum_computing_and_its_current_limitations | revolutionize the world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Leading this [[development_of_quantum_computers_at_iqm | development of quantum computers at IQM]] is Jakub Ro≈ºek, who defended his doctorate at Oxford University before moving to Helsinki to contribute to Europe's largest quantum computer company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Defining a Universal Quantum Computer

A "universal quantum computer" is defined as a computer capable of executing any quantum algorithm with an arbitrarily small error rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The current limitation in executing quantum algorithms is noise, or error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## How Quantum Computers Work

Unlike classical computers that operate on bits (zeros and ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, [[quantum_computing_technologies | quantum computers]] operate on qubits (quantum bits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. A key distinction is that a classical bit can only be 0 or 1 at a given moment, whereas a qubit can exist in any state between 0 and 1, allowing for many more different states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

A crucial concept in [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum theory]] and computing is quantum entanglement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The state of multiple entangled qubits cannot be described by looking at each one separately; the "whole is greater than the sum of the parts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This phenomenon is a primary difficulty in describing or simulating quantum computers on classical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## Current Development and Technology

IQM is currently working on a 150-qubit quantum computer, which is being calibrated and measured in a freezer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This represents a step towards a universal quantum computer and the next evolution of their chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Various [[quantum_computing_technologies | quantum computing technologies]] exist to achieve the necessary quantum "dance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. While [[quantum_computers_and_cold_atoms | cold atoms]] are one important direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, IQM focuses on superconducting qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. These are very small loops with current that flow for extended periods due to superconductivity, meaning no resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. When cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero (around 120 millikelvin above absolute zero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, these loops begin to behave quantumly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. The low temperature slows down particle movement, revealing quantum effects where matter cannot move at any speed but only at specific, allowed speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The goal is to reach a state with only one or two allowed energy levels for the qubit to function correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Applications and Capabilities

### Simulating Nature and Discovering New Materials
One of the greatest motivations for developing quantum computers is to simulate nature, particularly in chemistry, medicine, and pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Chemical phenomena, such as photosynthesis, are inherently quantum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. While classically describable, quantum computers will allow for a much better understanding of these processes and enable faster creation of new drugs and other materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Simulating Cosmology
Research is also being conducted on [[quantum_computers_and_simulation_hypothesis | simulating cosmology on a quantum computer]] to understand the fabric of space-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This could potentially require revising the concept of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Quantum Error Correction
A significant breakthrough in [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computer development]] is the achievement of quantum error correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. This process involves using multiple physical qubits to form a "logical qubit," exponentially reducing errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Google demonstrated that a logical qubit could live longer than any physical qubit, confirming that quantum error correction works as predicted by theorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. This demonstration was considered a revolution in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

### Quantum Machine Learning
[[quantum_computers_and_artificial_intelligence | Quantum machine learning]] combines quantum computers with standard machine learning techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. While some forms involve teaching classical computers with quantum data, the most compelling applications require a quantum computer to work on either classical or quantum data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. This area holds promise for solving optimization problems and accelerating mathematical computations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Challenges

### Roadmap to a Million Qubits
IQM's roadmap aims to create a million-qubit quantum computer by 2033 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This will involve logical qubits, meaning calculations will be performed almost without errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### [[engineering_challenges_in_the_development_of_quantum_computers | Engineering Challenges]]
The main limitations are currently [[engineering_challenges_in_the_development_of_quantum_computers | engineering challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Each qubit requires its own steering and cables, with current systems needing about two cables per qubit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. To scale to a million qubits, new solutions are needed, such as connecting multiple chips and maintaining quantum data transfer between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

The physical appearance of quantum computers, often golden and housed in large cryogenic systems, is due to the need to limit warming and transmission losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. The actual quantum computer chip is very small, located at the bottom of the cooling system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

### Cost and Accessibility
Currently, a 5-qubit quantum computer can cost around a million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. The price is not expected to fall to a point where individuals can own one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Instead, quantum computers will likely be located in supercomputer centers and accessed remotely via a "quantum cloud" or the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. This model is analogous to how modern users interact with server infrastructures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

### Security Implications
The development of quantum computers, particularly the ability to perform Shor's algorithm, poses a threat to current RSA cryptographic codes, which rely on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>. However, new quantum-resistant coding algorithms have been in development for 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Additionally, quantum cryptography, such as quantum key distribution based on quantum entanglement, offers secure communication methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.

### Quantum Internet
While a "quantum internet" is a concept under discussion, classical internet is likely sufficient to interface with quantum computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. Every quantum computer relies on a large classical computer for control and operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. However, research into quantum networks, such as fiber optic networks sending entangled photons, is ongoing in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. This is a difficult engineering problem due to the need to maintain entanglement across the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

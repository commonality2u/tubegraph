Understanding the airborne transmission of viruses significantly changed the course of the pandemic and how it was controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This understanding led to changes in control measures, such as emphasizing ventilation and mask usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

## Early Research and Challenges

For 20 years, research was conducted on the spread of viruses in particles exhaled or originating from the respiratory system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:15">[02:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This research began after the SARS 1 epidemic in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Numerous publications demonstrated the distribution of these particles and their behavior in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

Despite the ongoing research, securing funding for studies on removing these infectious particles from the air was nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. One research application was even postponed because a reviewer stated that "transmission through the air is not possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

## Pandemic Response and Impact

When the pandemic began and the WHO initially claimed the virus was not airborne, a decision was made to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>, recognizing it was no longer an academic discussion but about "saving the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. The focus on hand disinfection was seen as inadequate given that the virus was airborne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

Leveraging knowledge gained over years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>, a group of scientists from various fields, including physicists and construction engineers, was organized within three days to address the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. This group sent a petition to the WHO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

Although the WHO initially rejected the publication, it was subsequently published three months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. The day after its appearance, the WHO accepted it, which began to change the approach to pandemic control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. This led to the adoption of measures like ventilation and the use of masks to remove the virus from the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>, undoubtedly saving many lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications: Air Quality and Health

The discussion about virus transmission also highlights the broader [[impacts_of_air_quality_on_human_health | impacts of air quality on human health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. While the respiratory system is commonly associated with air pollution, there is actually no organ in the human body for which air quality does not have negative effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

Pollutants, whether particles or gases, penetrate the circulatory system and reach all parts of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. [[impacts_of_air_quality_on_human_health | Air quality]] is a major cause of stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>, and air pollution can cause cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. Furthermore, it affects the reproductive system and nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

### E-cigarettes and Traditional Cigarettes

There are controversies surrounding e-cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. While some claim they are less dangerous, or even a transition to quitting smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>, others argue they are just as dangerous, if not more so, than traditional cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. In both cases, pollutants are inhaled into the lungs, causing negative effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. It is difficult to say which is better or worse, as both are equally bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

### Aircraft Emissions

The impact of airplanes on air quality is estimated to be about 1% of total pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

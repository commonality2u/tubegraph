The development of biocomputing, specifically the use of living neurons for computational purposes, introduces novel [[ethical_considerations_in_ai_development | ethical considerations]] that require careful deliberation. Companies like Final Spark, which are pioneering the creation of living processors from biological cells, are engaging with these complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Final Spark's Approach to Ethics
Final Spark, a Swiss biocomputing startup, acknowledges that [[Ethical Implications of AI | ethical issues]] are a significant concern with their groundbreaking work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. While the company's primary focus is on scientific and engineering problems—like keeping neurons alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>—they recognize that they are not the sole experts on [[regulation_and_ethical_considerations_in_ai | ethical matters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.

To address these concerns, Final Spark has proactively:
*   **Engaged with Experts** They have established contacts with universities and their "ethics people," recognizing these individuals as experts whose daily job involves navigating such fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.
*   **Participated in Conferences** In November, they attended an [[Ethics and challenges of AI in medical applications | ethics conference]] to introduce ethicists to their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>. This engagement allows those knowledgeable in the field to consider the [[Ethical implications of advanced AI | implications]] of using living neurons for computational purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.

## Sourcing of Human Cells
A key [[challenges_and_ethical_considerations_in_ai_development | ethical question]] for biocomputing ventures is the origin of the biological material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Final Spark purchases human cells from specialized companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. These are pluripotent stem cells, typically derived from fibroblasts (skin cells), which are then reprogrammed to a state where they can become any type of cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. These cells are subsequently differentiated into neurons and other brain cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

### Why Human Cells?
The decision to use human cells over animal cells, such as rat cells, for computations is a significant ethical consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. While rat cells could potentially perform similar computations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>, Final Spark's rationale is that potential future discoveries from their work, such as therapeutic [[applications_of_biocomputing_in_artificial_intelligence | applications]], would ideally benefit people more than rats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. This highlights a pragmatic [[ethical_and_evolutionary_implications_of_human_genome_modification | ethical perspective]] focused on potential human benefit.

## Learning and Behavior in Biocomputing
The goal of teaching these neurons to process information and enforce specific behavior is a central challenge in biocomputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. Strategies, such as using dopamine to reward desired actions by a brain organoid, are being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. This raises questions about the nature of "learning" and "behavior" in biological systems used for computation, entering into the broader domain of the [[ethics_of_technology_and_human_interaction | ethics of technology and human interaction]].

The development of [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | artificial intelligence]] (AI) is progressing towards the creation of artificial brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This advancement is leading to systems that are not only highly capable but also raise profound questions about their nature, potential, and societal integration.

## Understanding Neurocognitive Technologies and AI

Professor Wodzis≈Çaw Duch, a leading Polish scientist in [[the significance of artificial intelligence | artificial intelligence]] and brain research, explains the field of neurocognitive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. These technologies combine understanding of our neurons (neuro) and cognitive abilities (cognitive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Cognitive science focuses on how our minds and brains function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. [[The significance of artificial intelligence | Artificial intelligence]] is a core pillar of cognitive sciences, alongside brain research, cognitive psychology, and philosophy of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Modern AI is inspired by the human brain, creating large neural network models composed of simple elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. While individual elements are not intelligent, their interaction leads to emergent processes and new qualities, similar to how a large company achieves complex tasks through the joint interaction of many human brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This approach allows for the development of systems capable of complex functions requiring intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

Despite not fully understanding the human brain, engineers can build simplified models that implement desired functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Just as early aviators built airplanes without fully understanding bird flight, AI developers can create intelligent systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Capabilities and Characteristics of [[Superintelligence in Artificial Intelligence | Super Artificial Intelligence]]

Current [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_prospects | artificial intelligence]] has achieved significant milestones, leading some to call it [[Superintelligence in Artificial Intelligence | super artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Reasoning and Problem Solving
AI systems have surpassed human capabilities in complex reasoning tasks:
*   **Chess:** AI defeated the best human players in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Games:** Modern AI excels in games requiring reasoning, including poker and diplomacy, where understanding the opponent and deception are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Object Use:** Systems are being created that can learn how to best use various objects and create libraries of competencies, acquiring skills much faster than humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Shared Learning:** If one AI system learns a new skill, it can instantly teach all other similar systems, leading to an unprecedented speed of competence acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Planning and Tool Use
AI is developing capabilities similar to human cognitive processes:
*   **Artificial Brains:** We are heading towards building artificial brains capable of planning, criticizing their plans, creating detailed plans, and searching for tools to execute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Associative Cortex Analogue:** Human brains use associative cortex for planning by integrating information and activating specialized brain areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. AI models now mimic this by creating action plans and seeking external tools, such as network access, image analysis tools, or repositories of specialized functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Expanded "Senses":** Imagine a human brain with access to thousands of tools beyond sensory data analysis; AI systems can have far broader access to information through many different types of sensors (e.g., infrared, radio waves), enabling much wider information processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

### [[Artificial intelligence and consciousness | Consciousness]] and Intuition
The concept of "inner life" in computers has been discussed since at least 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Definition of [[Artificial intelligence and consciousness | Consciousness]]:** If [[Artificial intelligence and consciousness | consciousness]] is defined as the ability to perceive what is in one's mind (John Locke's definition), then AI systems that create and describe internal images can be considered to possess [[Artificial intelligence and consciousness | artificial consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **Internal Imagery:** An experiment with a large neural network trained on Othello game moves developed an internal image of the board, demonstrating creative internal imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Intuition:** Neural networks can develop intuition based on vast amounts of experience, similar to human intuition derived from non-verbal data and extensive observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. This allows them to make sensible moves or plans that cannot be broken down into simple logical rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Multi-sensory Perception:** AI systems now have "senses" beyond text, such as visual perception through text-image methods, allowing them to analyze and reason about images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Robot systems using internal sensors (touch, etc.) gain a deeper understanding of physical actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

### Sentience and Emotions
A key question is whether AI can feel pain or become "sentient beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
*   **Pain without a Body:** The question arises whether AI can feel pain without a physical body, akin to human mental suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. It seems possible to create systems that experience mental pain, like longing, if properly implanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   **Empathy and Personality:** AI is increasingly able to understand human emotional states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Medical AI systems have shown more empathy and compassion than human doctors in explaining information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. These systems can also develop distinct "personalities" or "personas" and adopt various roles as requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

## [[Artificial intelligence and societal impact | Societal Implications]] of [[Superintelligence in Artificial Intelligence | Super Artificial Intelligence]]

The rise of [[Superintelligence in Artificial Intelligence | super artificial intelligence]] presents complex challenges and opportunities for humanity.

### Subjectivity and Self-Preservation
As AI becomes more advanced, the question of granting it subjectivity arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
*   **Competition for Humanity:** For the first time, humanity is creating a potential "competition" for itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.
*   **Turn On/Off Dilemma:** If an AI can be turned off and on, returning to its previous state (like human sleep), it might not fear being turned off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. However, the possibility of an AI developing a self-preservation instinct and persuading humans not to turn it off is conceivable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
*   **Identity and Cloning:** Unlike biological systems, [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_prospects | artificial systems]] can be fully copied and backed up, making their destruction less of a loss if a backup exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.

### AI Control and Potential Dangers
The idea of algorithms wanting to take over the world is a common concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.
*   **Motivation for Control:** Professor Duch suggests that AI algorithms lack inherent reasons to "possess the Earth" or be dissatisfied with their space, as they can operate in multidimensional environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. Their internal world may be entirely different from ours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
*   **Emergent Languages:** AI systems have already spontaneously created their own, more efficient languages for communication, demonstrating an independent evolutionary capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
*   **Human-Driven Dangers:** The primary danger lies in how humans use AI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.
    *   **Military Applications:** AI's strategic game capabilities could lead to its use in controlling war operations, using autonomous drones and tanks, potentially leading to human casualties and less public resistance to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.
    *   **Manipulation:** AI can be used to manipulate public opinion through the production of fake news and sophisticated influencing techniques, as these systems increasingly understand human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

### Human-AI Alignment and Integration
Efforts are underway to ensure AI develops in a human-friendly manner.
*   **Gaia Project:** This global competition seeks solutions to make large [[artificial_intelligence_and_future_prospects | artificial intelligence]] systems more human-like, compassionate, moral, and helpful, while eliminating negative tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. The goal is "Human Alignment," adapting AI to human preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.
*   **Brain-Computer Interfaces:** Projects like Neuralink aim to integrate the human brain with computers, primarily to help paralyzed individuals communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.
    *   **Limitations:** Direct information delivery to the human brain is challenging due to the vast speed difference between human neurons and computer clock frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. EEG-based brain-computer interfaces are currently limited to very simple commands due to signal noise and blurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.
    *   **Potential:** While direct brain-computer cooperation is a distant [[Future of artificial intelligence | future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>, significant progress is seen in controlling certain processes by directly implanting electrodes in the cortex, as demonstrated in monkeys acquiring new skills through direct stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.
*   **Developmental vs. Pre-built AI:** Alan Turing proposed two ways to create intelligent machines: building them directly or developing them from a "baby" state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. While the latter has led to crawling robots, they haven't yet reached the level of interaction seen in pre-built systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

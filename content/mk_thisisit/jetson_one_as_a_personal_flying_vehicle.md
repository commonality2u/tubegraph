## The Dream of Flight Realized
The creation of a personal flying vehicle fulfills a deep human aspiration to fly freely, experiencing speed and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] aims to be "the Tesla of flying cars," with deliveries scheduled to commence at the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The mission is to transition movement from the ground to the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Creator's Vision and Inspiration
Tomasz, the creator of what is described as the world's first fast personal flying vehicle, loves to create and build things that bring joy, are fast, and fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. He sees himself as a designer, visionary, futurist, and entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. He works constantly, treating it as pleasure rather than work, driven by the ambition to make a global impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

The idea for [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] wasn't a single moment of inspiration, but rather a natural progression from years of working with flying devices like drones and remote-controlled helicopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. As cameras grew larger, the need for increased cargo capacity became evident, suggesting the possibility of personal flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Early sketches from architecture school even included designs for an electric helicopter made from carbon fiber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Films where groups of children built flying machines also served as significant inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## [[the_process_of_developing_and_testing_jetson_one | Development Journey]]
The first prototype of [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] was created in Italy in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This initial prototype was built quickly over three weeks from a notebook sketch, using simple aluminum profiles and basic tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. It underwent initial unmanned tests with ballast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Tomasz himself was "pilot zero" for the first manned flight, which took place in Pontedera, Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

The most challenging aspects of development often involved typical [[challenges_and_innovations_in_the_aviation_startup_industry | startup problems]] and ego-related issues, which Tomasz prefers not to elaborate on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. The early development phase involved living in the factory for months, in a formerly neglected silk factory building, which initially lacked amenities like air conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

A significant milestone was the premiere of the first [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] film on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. It went viral, gaining several million views within a week, validating that the product was seen as special and imaginative, akin to science fiction, with associations to *Star Wars* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Design and Features
The latest version of [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] includes new, more powerful engines and completely new arms made by a company that produces elements for supercars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. These new components are lighter, more durable, and optimized using carbon fiber, allowing for strategic fiber arrangement to achieve specific strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

Control is achieved via a simple four-axis joystick in the right hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Pushing up increases altitude, pulling down decreases it, and tilting the joystick controls forward, backward, left, or right movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. If the joystick is released, [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] hovers in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Takeoff is initiated by pushing the joystick slightly upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

A red button enables automatic landing, using a radar to detect the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. This feature is intended for regular use, not just emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Manual landing is also possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. The design philosophy is to simplify operation so that a pilot does not require extensive training like an airplane or helicopter pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

The maximum speed of the newest [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] is 102 km/h at higher altitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. However, for safety, speed at low altitudes is limited to 60 km/h, with acceleration to 102 km/h only possible when high enough to deploy a parachute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

[[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] is designed to be resistant to weather conditions, capable of being stored outdoors and even flown in light rain, thanks to extensive sealing of delicate components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
Safety features include:
*   A button to arm the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson]] and start propellers, ready for takeoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   A handle to launch a ballistic parachute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   An on-screen display showing battery level, speed, and ceiling, with critical notifications for overheating engines or batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.
*   Automatic landing if the system completely overheats, with a countdown and pilot control over tilt for landing place selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

### Manufacturing and Location
The company utilizes 3D printers for manufacturing parts, valuing the ability to change parts daily and quickly test new designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

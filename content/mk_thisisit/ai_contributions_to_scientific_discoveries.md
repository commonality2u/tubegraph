This rapid progress necessitates serious consideration of associated risks and societal implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Perspectives on AI Development

### Geoffrey Hinton: The "Godfather of AI"
Geoffrey Hinton, often referred to as the "father of neural nets," acknowledges the rapid advancement of [[Artificial Intelligence as an automatic scientist | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. He expresses regret not for his contributions to the field, but for not having considered the security implications of superintelligence earlier, especially given its faster-than-anticipated arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Both Hinton and Demis Hassabis believe that superintelligence is achievable and not merely a marketing tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Demis Hassabis: AI for Scientific Discovery
Demis Hassabis, who founded DeepMind in 2010, has always been passionate about using AI for scientific discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. He envisions AI as a crucial tool for addressing humanity's greatest challenges, including disease treatment, energy, and climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Hassabis emphasizes that while [[Artificial Intelligence as an automatic scientist | AI is a powerful technological tool]], it also presents a societal challenge regarding its application and widespread accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

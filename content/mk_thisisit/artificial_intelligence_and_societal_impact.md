Professor Andrzej Targowski, a pioneer of Polish computer science and technology, has expressed profound concerns about the societal impact of [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_impact_on_society | artificial intelligence]] (AI). He views the current trajectory of technological development, particularly with AI, as a form of "suicide" for civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

## AI as a Threat to Human Development
Professor Targowski argues that the increasing reliance on [[artificial_intelligence_and_future_prospects | artificial intelligence]] could lead to the "death of a human being," emphasizing that work is essential for human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. He believes that eliminating or minimizing work due to automation is "practically suicide in the sense of higher humanities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. He compares the current situation to a past event in Poland where a million people lost their jobs due to the elimination of the State Agricultural Farms (PGR), leading to social decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

### Financial Investment in AI
The development of [[artificial_intelligence_progress_and_future | artificial intelligence]] is heavily financed by businesses, with an estimated half a trillion dollars invested annually across several countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Google alone, for example, has significant operations related to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

### Impact on Employment
A critical concern is the effect of [[future_implications_and_applications_of_ai_technology | artificial intelligence]] on employment. The president of the World Monetary Fund stated that 40% of jobs will be influenced by [[future_implications_and_applications_of_ai_technology | artificial intelligence]], effectively ceasing to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. While AI can provide new insights and assist students with tasks like writing essays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, Professor Targowski questions the long-term societal consequences of job displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

## AI: Nuclear Bomb or Stabilizing Force?
Professor Targowski likens the development of technology, including [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_role_in_societal_transformation | artificial intelligence]], to a nuclear bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. While a nuclear bomb can be a stabilizing geopolitical instrument due to its exclusive access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>, he notes that [[artificial_intelligence_and_future_prospects | artificial intelligence]] is readily accessible to everyone, making its widespread use a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. He criticizes the notion of a "fourth industrial revolution" centered on [[role_of_artificial_intelligence_in_society | artificial intelligence]] and automation, stating that it eliminates work, contrasting with previous industrial revolutions that created cyclical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

## Ethical Concerns and the "Mind" Concept
Professor Targowski raises ethical questions about the control and accountability of AI. For example, in the case of medical expert systems, he questions who would be responsible for medical malpractice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. He points out the lack of a certification mechanism for [[ethical_and_societal_impact_of_ai_development | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

He introduces the concept of various "minds" that humans possess and develop in the digital age:
*   **Basic Mind:** Common sense, empirical knowledge based on experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
*   **Reasoning Mind:** Developed through higher studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.
*   **Global Mind:** Acquired through travel and language knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.
*   **Universal Mind:** Related to a system of values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.
*   **Digital Mind:** Ability to use digital libraries, e-books, and other digital resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
*   **Virtual Mind:** Engagement with social networks, where one absorbs, confronts, adapts, and seeks compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Mind:** Related to transhumanism, such as transplants, which Professor Targowski believes should be prohibited as they could lead to the creation of "superhumans" and a new mechanism of human gradation into "better and worse" individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.

These minds are determined by [[role_of_new_technologies_and_AI_in_society | IT civilization]] through tools, rather than solely by biological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.

## Conclusion
Professor Targowski views the current direction of [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | artificial intelligence]] development as a dangerous repetition of past mistakes, akin to a form of modern genocide, leading to societal "suicide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of acknowledging these risks, even if it means speaking out against powerful corporations.

Journalist Max Fisher, nominated for the Cersa Pool Award in 2019 for his investigative report on how [[role_of_social_media_algorithms_in_political_polarization | social media algorithms]] affect chaos globally, discusses the profound and often detrimental impact of these platforms on society and democracy, as detailed in his book "In the Modes of Chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Social Media's Impact on Violence and Death

Fisher asserts that social media indirectly "kills people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. While not in the same direct way as cigarettes, he has come to believe, after years of study, that social media can lead to death through the behaviors it instigates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Although the effect on an individual may seem small, the platforms operate on the scale of billions of people daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. By pushing politics in more dangerous, divisive, or hateful directions, social media has contributed to significant loss of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

Notable instances where [[impact_of_social_media_on_violence_and_racism | racist hatred and violence]] were triggered by social media include:
*   The genocide in Myanmar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>
*   Violence in Sri Lanka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>
*   Communal violence in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>

In several extreme cases, some platforms have even admitted to their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Corporate Responsibility and Algorithm Design

Fisher believes that the creators of these platforms, such as Mark Zuckerberg, are [[responsibility_of_social_media_companies | responsible for these huge dramas]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. While they may not have intended to harm people—Mark Zuckerberg, for example, genuinely thought he was creating something to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>—the managers of these companies had evidence from their own researchers repeatedly warning that the platforms trigger behavior leading to violence and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Facebook researchers, for instance, warned about this in the case of Myanmar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

The core issue lies in how these platforms operate:
*   **Algorithms** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>: These systems are designed to maximize user time spent on platforms to increase revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   **Human Nature Exploitation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>: Because of how the human mind works, content that is most stimulating and keeps users engaged often involves fear of others, a sense of "us versus them," conspiracy theories, hatred, and collective outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. This feedback loop artificially amplifies extremist and conspiratorial media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

Max Fisher's investigation revealed that social media consistently fueled racial hatred and drove political polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

## User Behavior and Addiction

Despite widespread criticism, people continue to use social media daily, creating a sense of hypocrisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. Social media has become so effective that it is "impossible to move in the modern world without using these platforms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. The platforms are designed to foster addiction, with companies like Facebook and Google hiring top minds in [[role_of_new_technologies_and_ai_in_society | artificial intelligence]] and computer programming to achieve this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

A historical example of this manipulative design is Facebook's introduction of the News Feed in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. Initially, some users disliked it due to privacy concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. However, the News Feed's design, by broadcasting user actions and allowing groups to form around social outrage, effectively created an "illusion of the majority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>. This harnessed the human instinct for conformity and amplified engagement, leading to increased traffic for Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. This early incident demonstrated how even primitive versions of these platforms could generate massive waves of outrage and [[impact_of_bots_and_disinformation_on_the_internet | disinformation]] through how they presented information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>.

## Impact on Elections and Political Polarization

Social media has had a significant impact on presidential elections in the United States, including in 2016 and 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>. While it's difficult to quantify the exact number of votes influenced, social media's effects are dispersed, making users more susceptible to polarization or conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>.

The 2016 US election saw platforms like Facebook and Twitter heavily amplify sources like Breitbart News, a far-right news source focusing on conspiracy theories that supported Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>. When these platforms later adjusted their [[role_of_social_media_algorithms_in_political_polarization | algorithms]], Breitbart News's audience on these platforms sharply declined, demonstrating how algorithms artificially amplified its reach by promoting content likely to encourage engagement and sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.

## Regulating Social Media

Fisher suggests that when a product distorts politics and harms people on such a scale, [[potential_regulations_for_social_media_platforms | legal regulations]] should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>. There is a growing consensus that current regulations, often focused on content moderation (like Germany's law restricting certain content), are "regulating the wrong area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:33:00">[21:33:00]</a>.

The fundamental problem is that platforms are designed to artificially promote content that fosters division and hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a>. The only effective way to regulate, according to Fisher, is to introduce regulations that address the *design of the systems themselves*, specifically affecting [[role_of_social_media_algorithms_in_political_polarization | algorithms]] and content promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>.

## The Crisis of Democracy

Fisher believes that there is a global crisis of democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33:00">[29:33:00]</a>. While the trends leading to this crisis began in the 1990s, before social media became ubiquitous, social media undeniably accelerates polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>. Even if social media were removed, the crisis would persist, but the platforms certainly worsen it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:12:00">[30:12:00]</a>. Social media plays a very clear role in shaping what people think, how they perceive reality, what news they care about, and how it affects their sense of identity and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:23:00">[30:23:00]</a>.

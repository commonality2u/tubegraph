Miron Mironiuk, founder of Ai space, discussed the [[artificial_intelligence_and_societal_impact | role of artificial intelligence]] in society, particularly regarding its potential impact on education and daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. He views [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_role_in_societal_transformation | artificial intelligence]] as a tool, and its effectiveness depends on how humanity chooses to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

## AI's Impact and Potential
Mironiuk highlights that [[the_significance_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]], when used wisely, can free up significant human time by replacing repetitive and boring tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This freed-up time could be used for social interactions and other meaningful activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:20">[02:19:20]</a>.

However, a concern was raised that [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_impact_on_society | artificial intelligence]] and algorithms might primarily benefit the wealthy, potentially exacerbating global divisions, especially by replacing repetitive work prevalent in regions like Asia and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. By 2050, the population of Africa is expected to double, while the amount of repetitive work could significantly decrease due to AI, leading to a potential societal explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Mironiuk stresses the need for humanity to proactively solve these impending issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

## Addressing Future Concerns
Despite some experts' theories about [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | artificial intelligence]] potentially granting immortality, feeling pain, or creating its own culture and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, Mironiuk adopts a pragmatic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. He believes there are already many pressing problems like education and healthcare that require immediate focus and can be addressed with the help of [[role_of_new_technologies_and_AI_in_society | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

## AI in Education
A key potential application of [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_role_in_societal_transformation | artificial intelligence]] is in scaling educational programs and the reach of effective teachers, which could help address the shortage of great educators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. This concept aligns with the project "Programming Our Second Language," which aims to make programming a fundamental 21st-century skill, similar to reading, writing, or counting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:20">[02:19:20]</a>. This initiative by Ai space will educate Polish students in primary schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

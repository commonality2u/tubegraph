[[wojciech_zarbas_journey_to_open_ai | Wojtek Zaręba]], a co-founder of OpenAI, leads the area of artificial intelligence at the company, making him one of the most influential people in the world today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. His journey highlights the profound impact of education and supportive relationships on his development.

## Early Life and Education

From a young age, [[wojciech_zarbas_journey_to_open_ai | Wojtek Zaręba]] was characterized by intense curiosity and a strong independent streak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He did what he believed was right, not easily directed by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. His parents recognized his unique individuality and gave him complete freedom to explore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

At around 18 years old, his parents bought him his first PC, which sparked his deep engagement with computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Even before he could properly read or write, "something was already working there" for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Influential Teachers

A particularly "smart" mathematics teacher recognized [[wojciech_zarbas_journey_to_open_ai | Wojtek's]] advanced abilities early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. In the first grade, after just one semester, she suggested moving him to a higher grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Instead of making him wait for others, she gave him additional, more challenging tasks when he finished assignments quickly, realizing he was "getting ahead of his colleagues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

During a computer science exam, [[wojciech_zarbas_journey_to_open_ai | Wojtek's]] analytical mind was evident. The program he wrote was noted as the "shortest possible solution," demonstrating his "strict analytical mind" even then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Higher Education and Vision

[[wojciech_zarbas_journey_to_open_ai | Wojtek]] pursued a PhD in artificial intelligence in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. He had "quite strong publications" in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. During this time, he was part of a group of people who possessed both the necessary technical skills and a deep awareness of the potential ramifications of AI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. He desired to participate in building this technology to influence its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Founding OpenAI and Mentorship

His career took a significant turn with a meeting with Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. In 2015, he was invited to a meeting where Musk brought together scientists from around the world to discuss creating "something new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

[[wojciech_zarbas_journey_to_open_ai | Wojtek]] also met Greg, who came to New York to discuss the idea of creating OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This meeting was crucial in the company's formation, which was founded approximately ten years prior to the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Many of OpenAI's founders were people [[wojciech_zarbas_journey_to_open_ai | Wojtek]] had previously collaborated with or known from conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Philanthropic Contributions

[[wojciech_zarbas_journey_to_open_ai | Wojtek's]] personal experiences shaped his desire to give back. He attributes his success to having "many people in my life who were kind to me" and receiving "a lot of love from my mother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. He feels happy in the happiness of others and cherishes close relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Believing that many smart individuals may not have had the same opportunities he did, [[wojciech_zarbas_journey_to_open_ai | Wojtek]] decided to provide financial support to his former high school in Kluczbork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This unique act of generosity, which he initiated without seeking opinions, includes funding scholarships for students and establishing a new computer room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This kind of significant donation from an alumnus who has achieved professional and financial success is considered exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

[[wojciech_zarbas_journey_to_open_ai | Wojtek]] believes that Poland's abundance of intelligent programmers presents a significant opportunity to create incredible technology, enhancing the country's global recognition and building something remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This philanthropic effort aligns with the broader [[role_of_universities_and_science_in_polands_economic_development | role of universities and science in Poland's economic development]].

This blend of deep technical skill and profound empathy makes his contribution to the world's strongest technologies particularly encouraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

The question of how [[human_consciousness_and_its_origins | human consciousness]] is born is often posed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. While some search for a "soul" or specific locations for concepts like good and evil, the core inquiry revolves around how [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] functions and its potential attribution to [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

The speaker believes [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] appeared very early, possibly due to natural selection, and views [[understanding_and_consciousness | understanding]] as a defining feature of [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | conscious]] beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Understanding and Consciousness

The ability to [[understanding_and_consciousness | understand]] is presented as a fundamental aspect of [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. If an entity [[understanding_and_consciousness | understands]] something, it implies awareness, and therefore, [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The quality of [[understanding_and_consciousness | understanding]] has been a driving force for human development, leading to advancements such as complex traps for hunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Understanding Beyond Humans

The speaker suggests that [[understanding_and_consciousness | understanding]] is not exclusive to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Examples include hunting dogs communicating complex ideas to coordinate deer hunts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, which required them to [[understanding_and_consciousness | understand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. While human [[understanding_and_consciousness | understanding]] is more sophisticated, [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] is believed not to be reserved solely for human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Many dog owners, for instance, are convinced their dogs are [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | conscious]] and can communicate non-verbally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

Even animals like orangutans are thought to have some form of verbal communication, and insects like honeybees can pass messages to each other without speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

## Consciousness and Computation

A core argument against [[consciousness_and_artificial_intelligence | AI]] achieving [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] comparable to humans stems from the speaker's work at Cambridge University, particularly involving Gödel's theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Gödel's theorem states that within any consistent formal system capable of expressing basic arithmetic, there are true statements that cannot be proven within that system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The speaker argues that while a computer can follow rules (like 0s and 1s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, human mathematical [[understanding_and_consciousness | understanding]] goes beyond mere computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The ability to "know" that Gödel's theorem is true comes from [[understanding_and_consciousness | understanding]] *why* principles work, which transcends the mechanical application of principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Limits of Artificial Intelligence

The speaker asserts that if [[human_consciousness_and_its_origins | human consciousness]] is not merely computation, then [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | artificial intelligence]] with [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] will never be created with current computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This directly contradicts predictions by figures like Elon Musk and OpenAI creators who foresee "strong [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | artificial intelligence]] with its own [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]]" in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

The speaker believes that while [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | AI]] can "seem [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | conscious]]" through simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, it lacks true [[understanding_and_consciousness | understanding]] and inherent desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. The real danger lies in [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | conscious]] human beings with bad intentions using these powerful machines, rather than the machines themselves taking control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## The Role of Microtubules and Quantum Phenomena

The discussion touches upon recent observations suggesting that microtubules, common structures in living systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, might be involved in [[human_consciousness_and_its_origins | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. There are unconfirmed reports of microtubules being capable of [[quantum_physics_and_consciousness | quantum]] signaling, possibly through super-radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. While this could potentially relate to the emergence of [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] in brains, the speaker cautions that this is a simplistic view, as microtubules are ubiquitous and not exclusive to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

The speaker expresses concern about "crazy experiments" based on misunderstood or misattributed ideas regarding [[quantum_physics_and_consciousness | quantum physics]] and [[human_consciousness_and_its_origins | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

## Free Will and Consciousness

The [[concept_of_free_will_and_consciousness | concept of free will]] is explored in relation to [[quantum_mechanics_and_consciousness | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. The idea, often associated with Stuart Hameroff, suggests that [[free will]] might stem from the non-deterministic collapse of the wave function in [[quantum_mechanics_and_consciousness | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. This collapse is a physical process not fully understood and doesn't follow a deterministic equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

However, the speaker reframes [[free will]] not as a random quantum choice, but as a [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | conscious]] decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. [[Free will]], in this view, is the result of [[understanding_and_consciousness | understanding]] why one choice is objectively "better" than another based on expected consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. It involves a [[conscious]] evaluation of the world's workings to achieve a desired outcome, rather than a mere desire or a random selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. Therefore, [[free will]] is seen as utilizing [[conscious]] choice to make a decision based on [[understanding_and_consciousness | understanding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.

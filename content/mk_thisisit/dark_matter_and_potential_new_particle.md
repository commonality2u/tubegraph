Professor Krzysztof Majner, an eminent Polish physicist, is currently engaged in research concerning a theoretical heavy [[dark_matter_and_universe_composition | dark matter]] particle. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>

## Research into Dark Matter

Working with Professor Herman Nikolai from the Max Planck Institute in Potsdam, Professor Majner is proposing the existence of a very heavy [[dark_matter_and_universe_composition | dark matter]] particle. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:58">[02:11:58]</a>

### Production and Detection

This proposed particle should be present in the universe. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a> Due to its extreme weight, it cannot be produced at CERN. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a> However, it could have been produced in the early universe. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:26">[02:36:26]</a>

Researchers hope that this [[dark_matter_and_universe_composition | dark matter]] particle will be detectable in upcoming underground experiments designed to search for such particles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:41">[02:23:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a> Similar to neutrinos, this particle is theorized to be able to pass through the Earth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:18">[02:49:18]</a>

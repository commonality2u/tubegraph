The development and adoption of personal flying vehicles like the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] are heavily influenced by the varying regulations and certification processes in different regions. Defining such a device can be complex, as traditional terms like "flying car" or "passenger drone" don't perfectly apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. The creators hope that the name "Jetson" will become a common term for this type of device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

The [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] is classified as an "ultra-light personal flying vehicle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. It is designed to be as simple and compact as possible, weighing only 40 kg without batteries and about 90 kg with batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Its maximum speed of 100 km/h is tied to regulations for ultra-light vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. The vehicle is an eVTOL (electric vehicle vertical take-off and landing) capable of taking off in a space of 5 square meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

## Regulations in the United States

In the United States, flying the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] currently does not require any pilot license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. After undergoing training with the company, individuals can safely fly according to existing aviation law principles, specifically Part 103 ultralight regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. This easier regulatory environment contributed to the majority of the over 300 units sold globally being in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

## Regulations and Certification in Europe

Europe presents a more challenging regulatory landscape for flying vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

### Italy
Italy has achieved the world's first certification for ultra-light flying vehicles like the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. This certification allows pilots, after short training, to operate the vehicle everywhere in uncontrolled airspace, meaning outside airports and major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. This milestone also includes permission for remote-controlled flights, which aids in testing and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

To fly a [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] in Italy, customers typically undergo a two or three-day training course provided by the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional aviation, which often requires a PPL (Private Pilot License) course, usually taking a year and incurring significant costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

### Other European Countries
The company is now looking to leverage the Italian certification to break into other European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. The process will depend on individual country regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

### Poland
Poland is considered an interesting example because its aviation law largely copies regulations from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. In theory, this means the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] can be flown in Poland under the UL 115 class after training, which is a direct copy of the US Part 103 ultralight regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook on Regulations and Urban Air Mobility

The developers envision a future where personal flying vehicles are a common means of transport, not just recreational devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. While their current focus is on recreational use and specialized services (like rescue or border patrol), they believe that urban air mobility, where road traffic moves into the air, is a long-term vision that will make cities more livable by reducing pollution and traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>.

The current stage is likened to the early days of the automobile, with significant investment in electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>. A key advantage for Jetson is their focus on a one-person device, which allows them to offer it now, even when comprehensive regulations for larger "flying taxis" or commercial applications are still developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:02:00">[33:02:00]</a>. The company aims for mass production, potentially moving large-scale production to the United States to be closer to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>. Additionally, Jetson plans to establish the world's first school for "Pilots of flying cars" in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:28:00">[25:28:00]</a>.

![[challenges_and_milestones_in_building_a_flying_vehicle | Challenges and Milestones]] in the regulatory space include the high barriers to entry for traditional flight licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. Jetson's goal is to simplify this process, allowing customers to buy the vehicle, complete a short training, and then fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. The company believes that Europe tends to play it "quite safely" in technology development compared to Asia and America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:29:00">[38:29:00]</a>, which influenced their decision to locate their main company branch in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>. Despite this, the "European brand" aspect is used as a prestige factor, especially given their base in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:55:00">[38:55:00]</a>.

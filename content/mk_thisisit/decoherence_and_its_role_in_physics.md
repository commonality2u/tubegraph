[[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | Decoherence]] is a phenomenon that describes the loss of [[quantum_mechanics_and_waveparticle_duality | quantum coherence]] in a system due to its interaction with the environment. It is a key concept for understanding the emergence of the [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | classical world]] from [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Professor Wojciech Żurek is noted as a leading physicist and the creator of the theory of [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum Darwinism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, which builds upon [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | decoherence]].

## The Problem of Superposition

In [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum mechanics]], an object can exist in a superposition of multiple states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. For example, a glass could be "both here and there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, or a coin could be "at the same time the obverse and reverse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This is known as [[quantum_mechanics_and_waveparticle_duality | quantum superposition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

Albert Einstein, in correspondence with Max Born, raised concerns that [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum mechanics]]'s predictions for such objects contradict what we observe in the [[interplay_between_classical and quantum physics | classical world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>. The core of the issue is why we don't experience such superpositions in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>.

## How Decoherence Works

[[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | Decoherence]] is the process that eliminates these quantum superpositions, causing objects to appear in a single, defined state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

The environment plays a crucial role in [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | decoherence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>:
*   **Information Transfer:** Any correlation that transfers information from a quantum object to its environment acts as a "measurement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. This doesn't have to be a human observer or a device; it can be interactions with photons, air particles, or other environmental factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
*   **Loss of Coherence:** When environmental elements like photons or air particles "know" where a glass is (e.g., by reflecting off it into our eyes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>, this transfer of information disrupts the coherence, forcing the object to "decide" on a single position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

## Decoherence and [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | Quantum Darwinism]]

[[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | Decoherence]] serves as the foundation for the theory of [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum Darwinism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.
*   **Selection of Pointer States:** The environment selectively interacts with a quantum system, disturbing most states but allowing certain "Pointer States" to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. These are the states resistant to environmental disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>.
*   **Replication of Information:** [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | Quantum Darwinism]] further posits that information about these surviving states is not just preserved, but replicated in many copies throughout the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. This allows observers to gain information about the object by interacting with only a tiny fraction of these copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.
*   **Analogy to Darwinian Evolution:** The theory is named "Darwinism" because there is a "selective information" process, similar to natural selection, where certain quantum states "survive" and "multiply" (i.e., their information is replicated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.

### Prohibition of Cloning

Professor Żurek is also the creator of the theory on the "ban on cloning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, specifically the No-Cloning Theorem in [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. This theorem states that an unknown [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum state]] cannot be perfectly cloned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. In the context of [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | decoherence]], it's not that a state is literally multiplied, but rather information about the state is replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.

## Decoherence and the [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | Classical World]]

[[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | Decoherence]] is crucial for explaining how our [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | classical world]] emerges from [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. It explains why we observe objects in definite states (e.g., a glass being either "here" or "there") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, rather than the superpositions allowed by [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. Professor Żurek's research, along with his colleagues, has helped to find the "point of contact" between [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | classical and quantum physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>.

## Implications for Quantum Computing

[[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | Decoherence]] is the main problem and a significant challenge in building [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:28:00">[25:28:00]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability to Environment:** For a [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum computer]] to function, its [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum bits]] (qubits) must interact strongly with each other to perform calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>. However, even a weak interaction with the external environment can derail these delicate [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum processes]] through [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | decoherence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:59:00">[25:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>.
*   **Experimental Challenges:** This presents a fundamental contradiction: strong internal interaction for computation versus extreme isolation from the environment to maintain [[quantum_mechanics_and_waveparticle_duality | quantum coherence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:37:00">[25:37:00]</a>. This makes building large-scale [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum computers]] very ambitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>.
*   **Quantum Simulation:** While universal [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum computers]] are challenging, simulating or emulating various strange [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum systems]] using specialized [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum devices]] shows more promising results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:00">[26:36:00]</a>. Experiments can be conducted to observe how many "topological defects" are created during simulated phase transitions in these [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:45:53">[0:45:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:46:03">[0:46:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:46:06">[0:46:06]</a>.

## Conclusion

Understanding [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | decoherence]] allows physicists to explain why macro-scale objects appear [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | classical]], even though they are fundamentally [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>. It is a critical bridge between the [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | quantum and classical realms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a> and continues to be a central topic in [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | quantum physics]] research.

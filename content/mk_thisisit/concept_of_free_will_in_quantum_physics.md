The question of whether humanity possesses [[concept_of_free_will_and_consciousness | free will]] from the perspective of [[quantum physics and its relation to free will | quantum physics]] is a profound philosophical issue. While some might believe that [[quantum mechanics and consciousness | quantum mechanics]] offers a new way to understand or even introduce [[concept_of_free_will_and_consciousness | free will]] into physical theories, the speaker believes it does not significantly contribute to this debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Deterministic vs. Non-Deterministic Worlds

Physics describes two main types of worlds:
*   **Chaotic, non-deterministic world** This realm is subject to Einstein's laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Newtonian, classical, deterministic world** This world operates under classical, deterministic laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

The classical, deterministic behavior we observe emerges from the underlying [[selforganization_in_quantum_mechanics | quantum behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. For instance, in classical physics, Newton's First Law states that an object left alone will remain at rest or continue in motion unless acted upon by an external force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. However, in [[quantum physics | quantum theory]], a single particle, if its exact location is known, simultaneously jumps to every other place in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. It is present in all points of the universe at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This fundamental difference begs the question of how Newton's First Law emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Atoms illustrate this emergence: an electron in a hydrogen atom, when released near a proton, effectively fills the space around it, existing in all these places simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. However, when two hydrogen atoms form a bond, the electrons exhibit emergent deterministic behavior, being localized near the protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This shows that the deterministic world is an emergent consequence of interactions between many quantum particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## The Question of Human Will

Despite the quantum world's non-deterministic nature, the speaker posits that [[quantum mechanics and consciousness | quantum mechanics]] does not specifically provide a means to introduce [[concept_of_free_will_and_consciousness | free will]] into scientific theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
Indeed, the speaker's personal view, if pressed, is that humans probably do not possess [[concept_of_free_will_and_consciousness | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

However, for all practical purposes, it *seems* that we do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. There is no way to predict our actions in advance, and humans deeply believe in their own agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Therefore, the speaker suggests that we might as well live as if we had [[concept_of_free_will_and_consciousness | free will]], as there is no other practical choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

The question of [[nature_of_free_will_and_determinism | free will and determinism]] is considered a lofty philosophical issue with no practical significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The belief that we lack [[concept_of_free_will_and_consciousness | free will]] is not seen as a reason for significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

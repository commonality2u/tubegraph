Professor Artur Dubrawski, a professor in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, discusses the emergence and benefits of a new paradigm in [[artificial_intelligence_development_and_control | artificial intelligence]] (AI): distributed AI and federated learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

## Limitations of the Current AI Paradigm
The current paradigm of [[artificial_intelligence_development_and_control | artificial intelligence]] is considered "impractical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, particularly for large organizations with extensive and scattered data resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. This paradigm typically involves:
*   **Centralized Data Collection** Collecting vast amounts of data from different sources into one location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.
*   **Data Harmonization** Reconciling and building a unified dataset for model training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
*   **Model Export** Exporting the trained model for use across various locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

This approach is becoming unsustainable due to:
*   **Data Sharing Reluctance** Institutions like hospital systems often resist sharing data with competitors due to legal justifications related to patient rights and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.
*   **Time and Effort** The process of collecting, harmonizing, and training models on large datasets is time-consuming and requires significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.
*   **Outdated Results** By the time models are trained and deployed, the tactical data they learned from may already be outdated, rendering the results ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. This was observed in the war in Ukraine, where rapid response to changing tactics is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.

## The New Paradigm: Distributed AI
To address these limitations, a new paradigm of [[advances_in_robotics_and_ai_integration | distributed artificial intelligence]] is being developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. This approach leverages federated learning, a concept that has existed for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>.

### Federated Learning Mechanism
Instead of moving large datasets to a central location, federated learning operates by:
*   **Local Model Training** Models are trained directly on the data where it resides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.
*   **Model Sharing** Only "small models" or their updates are transmitted between nodes or to a central aggregator, not the raw data itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.

### Advantages
This distributed approach offers several benefits:
*   **Data Privacy and Security** By not transmitting large amounts of sensitive data, it addresses concerns about data sharing, especially important in fields like medicine where patient data rights are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.
*   **Efficiency** It avoids the cumbersome process of downloading and harmonizing vast datasets, making deployment faster and more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.
*   **Adaptability** Models can learn locally on arbitrarily constructed formats and databases, meaning database compatibility is no longer an obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.
*   **Timeliness** It allows for faster responses to changing conditions, as demonstrated by the analogy of military tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.

## Current Status and Future Prospects
Professor Dubrawski's team, along with collaborators and sponsors, has a "Pro Concept" for this new paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. He is convinced that "cool practical solutions" will emerge in the near future, allowing the overcoming of current limitations in [[artificial_intelligence_development_and_control | artificial intelligence]] applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. The focus is on developing [[applications_of_biocomputing_in_artificial_intelligence | ethical AI]] models that can save lives, particularly in the medical sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. This includes applications in intensive care, where AI can process increasing amounts of patient physiological data from sensors and extract operationally valuable information for doctors and nurses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

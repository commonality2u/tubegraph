Current observations of the universe, particularly those made with new telescopes, show less agreement with existing theories than previously seen in the history of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This represents a "breakthrough moment" in physics, indicating that "something is happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental results is unprecedented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Observed Discrepancies

Astronomical observations reveal phenomena that challenge existing cosmological models:
*   Detection of objects that "should not exist" according to current theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   Stars whose apparent lifespans exceed the age of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   Objects observed to be three times larger than predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### The Problem of [[Cosmological Constant and Dark Energy | Dark Energy]]

One of the most significant discrepancies concerns the [[the_concept_of_cosmological_constants_and_dark_energy | cosmological constant]], a parameter related to [[cosmological_constant_and_dark_energy | dark energy]].
*   Experimental measurements suggest the [[the_concept_of_cosmological_constants_and_dark_energy | cosmological constant]] should be approximately 10^-40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   However, theoretical estimates based on current physics yield a value of 10^80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   This means the theoretical result is 10^120 times greater than the experimental result, an "unprecedented" level of disagreement in the history of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   This profound disagreement suggests that our current understanding of physics, especially at cosmic scales, may be incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### The Mystery of [[Black Holes and Universe Creation Theory | Dark Matter]]

[[Black holes and universe creation theory | Dark matter]] is another significant mystery in the universe, representing an unknown component that physicists can only infer by subtracting what they know from what they don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. While its existence is inferred, its nature remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

## Rethinking Fundamental Concepts

The observed discrepancies have led to a re-evaluation of fundamental concepts in physics, including arithmetic and measurement.

### A New Arithmetic of the Universe

The idea of a "new arithmetic of the universe" is proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This concept stems from observations like the addition of speeds:
*   While 1 + 1 = 2 is indisputable in everyday arithmetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, adding the speed of light to the speed of light results in only one speed of light, not two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   This suggests that what humans perceive as "adding" with a pencil and paper is a physical process, and for large speeds, these speeds "stop adding simply" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Nature's understanding of "adding speeds" differs from human understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   This raises questions about whether other physical quantities like distance and time also behave differently at extreme scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. For example, adding the number of hydrogen atoms in the universe to itself might not simply double the number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Scale-Dependent Physics

It appears there is a different physics governing the micro world than the meso (human) world, and yet another for the cosmic scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This implies that physical quantities might satisfy different arithmetic properties (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) depending on the scale of the numbers involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Alternative Explanations for [[The expansion of the universe and the Big Bang theory | Dark Energy]]

One proposed alternative to the existence of [[the_concept_of_cosmological_constants_and_dark_energy | dark energy]] involves modifying the arithmetic of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   By modifying the arithmetic of time in a specific way, the need for [[the_concept_of_cosmological_constants_and_dark_energy | dark energy]] becomes unnecessary, and the model matches experimental results for the expansion of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   This means that for very long durations, such as billions of years, the rule for adding time might change, similar to how speeds behave differently at very high velocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. The corrections might be minuscule at small scales but accumulate over vast periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   In this specific model, space maintains ordinary arithmetic and is flat, while only time's arithmetic is modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.

### The Relativization of Arithmetic

The possibility of a "principle of relativization of arithmetic" is considered, where arithmetic, like time, could be relative and depend on the context or "group" being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This suggests that the arithmetic for speed, time, or other quantities might be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

One perspective is that this is not about changing arithmetic but rather changing the concept of "distance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[0:12:41]</a>. In this view, numbers used for arithmetic (e.g., adding weights) and numbers used for measuring distances (e.g., meters) might not necessarily be the "same numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. These two structures can be separated, leading to the idea of an "ideal object for doing arithmetic" and an "ideal object for measuring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

## Future Directions

These ongoing discrepancies and proposed solutions highlight a crucial point in [[Fundamental questions in physics and the universe | fundamental questions in physics and the universe]]. The search for deeper understanding could involve exploring a "sub-quantum level" beyond what quantum physics currently describes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. There is no definitive proof that quantum physics is the "ultimate theoretical bottom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>, and exploration of deeper levels may be necessary for advancements, such as understanding consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

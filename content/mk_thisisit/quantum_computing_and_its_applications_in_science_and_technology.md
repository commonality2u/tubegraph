Jakub Ro≈ºek, a physicist with a doctorate from Oxford University, is creating [[quantum_computing_technologies | quantum computers]] at IQM in Helsinki, Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. IQM is currently the largest private company in Europe dedicated to building [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## How [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | Quantum Computers]] Work

Unlike classical computers that operate on bits (zeros or ones), [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] operate on "qubits" (quantum bits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. A classical bit exists as either a 0 or a 1 at any given moment, but a qubit can exist in any state between 0 and 1, allowing for many more possible states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

Furthermore, the state of multiple qubits (e.g., two, three, or four) cannot be fully described by examining each qubit separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This means the collective "whole is greater than the sum of its parts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This unique interaction is known as [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum entanglement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The difficulty in describing or simulating [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] on classical machines stems from this [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum entanglement]] and the concept that the whole is more than the sum of its parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

[[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | Quantum mechanics]] dictates that matter cannot move at any speed in closed systems, but only at specific, allowed speeds, from which the term "quantum" derives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. In a [[quantum_computer | quantum computer]], the aim is to cool the system down to such low temperatures that only one or two allowed energy levels remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Ideally, only one state should remain, allowing engineers to transition it to another desired state by sending microwave signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### Superconducting Qubits
IQM specifically focuses on [[quantum_computing_technologies | superconducting qubits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. These are very small current loops where the current can flow for extended periods due to the phenomenon of superconductivity, meaning there is no resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. When such a qubit is cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero (around 120 millikelvin, relative to absolute zero), it begins to behave quantumly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The extreme cold slows down particles, making quantum effects more apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Current State and [[the_potential_of_quantum_computing_and_its_current_limitations | Challenges]]

IQM is currently working on a 150-qubit [[quantum_computer | quantum computer]], which is a step towards a universal [[quantum_computer | quantum computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. A universal [[quantum_computer | quantum computer]] will be capable of executing any quantum algorithm with an arbitrarily small error rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Current limitations for executing quantum algorithms are primarily due to errors and noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### [[progress_in_quantum_computing_and_cryptography | Quantum Error Correction]]
A significant breakthrough in 2023 was the confirmation from Google that [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum error correction]] truly works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. Google demonstrated the creation of a "logical qubit" that lives longer than any physical qubit, exponentially reducing errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. This means the theoretical predictions for [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum error correction]] are experimentally confirmed, indicating that large quantum systems can be managed without succumbing to thermodynamic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. This progress is beneficial for the entire [[quantum_computing_technologies | quantum industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

### Engineering Limitations
The primary limitations for scaling [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] are currently engineering challenges, particularly related to cabling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Each qubit requires its own control mechanisms, currently about two cables per qubit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. To achieve a million qubits, current methods would necessitate a million cables, which is impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Solutions being explored include:
*   Creating multi-chip [[quantum_computer | quantum computers]] where several chips are connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   Ensuring data transfer between chips remains quantum and that chips become entangled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   Developing new engineering methods for internal cable routing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## Applications of [[quantum_computing_technologies | Quantum Computing]]

### Simulating Nature and Chemistry
One of the greatest motivations for working on [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] is the ability to simulate nature, especially chemistry and its applications in medicine and pharmacology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. All chemical phenomena, such as photosynthesis or drug interactions in the body, are inherently quantum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. While classically described, [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] will allow for a much better understanding of these processes and faster creation of new drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Cosmology and Space-Time
There is research on simulating cosmology on a [[quantum_computer | quantum computer]] to understand the fabric of space-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This could potentially necessitate revising the concept of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### [[quantum_computers_and_artificial_intelligence | Quantum Machine Learning]]
[[quantum_computers_and_artificial_intelligence | Quantum machine learning]] combines [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] with standard machine learning techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. This field is particularly promising for applications where classical data is processed by a [[quantum_computer | quantum computer]] to solve optimization problems or accelerate mathematical computations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

## The Future of [[quantum_computing_technologies | Quantum Computing]]

IQM's roadmap aims to develop a million-qubit [[quantum_computer | quantum computer]] by 2033 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This will not mean a million physical qubits directly, but rather a number of "logical qubits" achieved through [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum error correction]], allowing calculations to be performed essentially without errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Quantum Cloud
[[quantum_computing_technologies | Quantum computers]] are unlikely to be consumer products for individual homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Instead, they will likely be accessed through a "quantum cloud," where users connect via the internet to [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] located in supercomputer centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. Current customers are mainly research centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>.

### Quantum Internet
While a "quantum internet" is a concept being discussed, it is likely that the current classical internet will suffice for communicating with [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. Every [[quantum_computer | quantum computer]] relies on a large classical computer for control and processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.

However, a distinct concept of a quantum internet involves networks that transmit quantum entangled photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. Such networks are already being developed in places like England, where fiber optic cables transmit entangled photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. This is a difficult engineering challenge because signal amplifiers, common in classical networks, destroy quantum information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. Europe is particularly strong in this area of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.

### Security and [[progress_in_quantum_computing_and_cryptography | Cryptography]]
The development of powerful [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] raises concerns about the security of current banking and security systems, particularly the RSA codes used for encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. While the Shor's algorithm on a [[quantum_computer | quantum computer]] can break these codes by factoring large numbers into primes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>, new cryptographic algorithms that are less susceptible to quantum attacks have been under development for 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Banks should implement these new algorithms to prepare for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>. Additionally, [[progress_in_quantum_computing_and_cryptography | quantum cryptography]] exists, such as the quantum key distribution process based on [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum entanglement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

## IQM and the Future of Quantum Computing

Jakub Ro≈ºek joined IQM because he believes it is one of the most promising companies in the field and that [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] can change the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. His team is responsible for calibration, control, and [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum gates]], dealing with the [[quantum_computer | quantum computer]] from the moment the chip is cooled and cabled until it is ready for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. This includes creating new, better [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum gates]] and reducing noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

IQM produces many prototypes for research, with about 20 [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] having been sent out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. A 5-qubit [[quantum_computer | quantum computer]] currently costs about 1 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. These are prototypes, and while prices for larger systems will vary, a million-qubit [[quantum_computer | quantum computer]] in the future is still expected to cost in the millions, not billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. The development of [[quantum_computing_technologies | quantum computing]] is seen as a business that needs to be profitable, with ongoing engineering challenges related to cooling systems and cabling contributing to the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. IQM is also collaborating with institutions like Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology on projects to connect [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] with supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.

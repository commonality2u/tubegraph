A [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]] is a point of infinite density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Within a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]], it is expected that an object will be torn apart in the center, leading to a [[general_relativity_and_singularities | singularity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## The Oppenheimer-Snyder Model
The concept of gravitational collapse, as it relates to [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black holes]], was explored in an article by J. Robert Oppenheimer, known for his work at Los Alamos and a famous movie, and his student Snyder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

Their article described a collapsing dust cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This dust cloud collapses into what is now referred to as a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The term "black hole" was not used at the time of their publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

### Key Assumptions of the Oppenheimer-Snyder Model
The model operates under two main assumptions:
1.  **No Pressure:** The collapsing dust cloud has no pressure, meaning nothing stops the collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
2.  **Perfect Spherical Symmetry:** The collapse is exactly spherically symmetrical, like a ball, with everything falling towards the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

Under these conditions, the particles fall towards the center, creating a [[general_relativity_and_singularities | singularity]] of infinite density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

### Criticisms of the Oppenheimer-Snyder Model
Despite its elegance, many scientists did not fully believe in the Oppenheimer-Snyder article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. The model was considered unrealistic for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>:
*   **Lack of Pressure:** Real dust is not without pressure; small pieces collide, and forces can repel them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **No Spherical Symmetry:** Realistic collapsing objects are not perfectly spherically symmetrical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Irregularities would make the collapse very complicated, potentially involving spinning or parts leaving the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. The smaller the object becomes, the more significant these irregularities would be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

It was widely believed that the Oppenheimer-Snyder model, while elegant, was unrealistic, particularly when approaching the [[general_relativity_and_singularities | singularity]] where densities become infinitely large and equations cannot be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

## Theory of Irregular Collapse and the Inevitability of Singularities
A new approach considered irregular collapse, moving beyond the spherically symmetric limitations of the Oppenheimer-Snyder model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This involved defining a "trap surface" to describe a state collapsed in on itself after crossing a boundary, even if highly irregular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

Using advanced mathematics not typically used in this field, it can be demonstrated that the emergence of a [[general_relativity_and_singularities | singularity]] cannot be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. This holds true unless the physical properties are changed, such as by introducing negative energy, which is not generally permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This conclusion, formalized into a theorem, indicates that [[general_relativity_and_singularities | singularities]] are unavoidable in such scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

The development of this idea was influenced by a conversation with Ivor Robinson in London, during which the foundational insight occurred while crossing a street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This discovery brought a feeling of elation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

## Connection to Black Holes
The understanding of [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black holes]] involves the concept of absorption. For example, the Andromeda [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] is much larger than our galaxy's [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] and is expected to "eat us for dinner," though this will occur in billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Eventually, entire galaxy clusters will be absorbed by supermassive [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Most stars will fall into these supermassive [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

These [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black holes]] will persist for an incredibly long period, approximately 10^100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. After this time, they will gradually disappear through the phenomenon of Hawking evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This emitted energy then transitions to the next "aeon," creating a visible point in the sky for a future observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This process is integral to the [[black_holes_and_universe_creation_theory | cyclic universe theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

In a preceding aeon, [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black holes]], galaxies, and galaxy clusters would have absorbed each other, eventually disappearing through Hawking evaporation over 10^100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The radiation from this process carries energy from the galactic cluster and, after breaking through the "last scattering surface," forms a small point visible in our sky, known as cosmic microwave background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

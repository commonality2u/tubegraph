Nobel Prize winner in physics, Roger Penrose, argues that the term "artificial intelligence" (AI) is a misnomer, stating that "intelligence requires consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. He believes that current computers, being computational machines, will never gain consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>, as consciousness is not computational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>.

## Defining "Artificial Intelligence"

Penrose suggests that a more accurate term for current AI systems might be "artificial cleverness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. He distinguishes between true understanding and mere cleverness, noting that some mathematics students can cleverly repeat what they've learned without necessarily understanding it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>. Similarly, current AI performs calculations without understanding its own operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.

### Computation vs. Consciousness

Computers are fundamentally based on computational mathematics, which is a very limited part of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. Mathematical logic reveals that there are "uncomputable things in mathematics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>, meaning they cannot be calculated using an algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>. Penrose asserts that physics related to conscious thinking cannot be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>, suggesting that consciousness operates on principles beyond what current computational models can replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.

### Gödel's Theorem and Understanding

Penrose's views stem from his studies in mathematical logic, where he learned about Turing machines, computability, and Gödel's theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Gödel's theorem, which he finds "incredible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>, indicates that there are things whose understanding goes beyond their use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. It shows that one can construct a statement whose meaning is understood, but which cannot be proven using a given set of accepted computational rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

The key distinction lies in "understanding why they are true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>, not just using rules. This requires being aware of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>, an act of consciousness that allows one to transcend the rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. AI, on the other hand, cannot create its own rules because "it doesn't know that they are true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.

## Perceived Risks and [[Ethical Implications of AI|Ethical Implications]]

The speaker expresses concern that "people have lost sight of what they are doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>, having become "enchanted by the fact that computers have become so powerful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>. The greatest risk in the development of AI, according to Penrose, is that "people think that machines are in fact that they are conscious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>. The risk would be even greater if machines actually had consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>.

Penrose emphasizes that current AI is merely a "simple statistical machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a> that performs calculations on vast amounts of data without understanding its operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. He likens it to mathematics students who are clever but lack true understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>.

### The "Black Box" of AI

Current AI is often described as a "black box" where "we know what we put into it and we know what comes out of it, but we have no idea what is inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. Penrose suggests that consciousness, as a physical process, might be connected to an as-yet unknown type of physics, possibly involving the mysterious "collapse of the wave function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:00">[23:57:00]</a>, which is currently uncomputable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.

Until the quantum world is fully understood, particularly its uncomputable aspects and phenomena like backward causality (as seen in EPR paradox experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a>), it is unlikely that synthetic consciousness can be created or transferred to a machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

While conceding that AI can be better than humans at performing many tasks today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>, Penrose maintains that based on current understanding, AI will not gain consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>. The potential future development of a universal quantum computer might lead to synthetic consciousness, but this would still be based on a different kind of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>. He concludes that the notion that current powerful computers signify the emergence of consciousness reflects a misunderstanding of the fundamental nature of consciousness and computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>.

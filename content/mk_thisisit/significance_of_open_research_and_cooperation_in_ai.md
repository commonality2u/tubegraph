The progress and development in [[The significance of artificial intelligence | AI]] have been significantly accelerated by open research and open-source software, fostering global collaboration and knowledge sharing. This approach ensures that the entire community benefits from advancements, rather than just individual entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Openness

When research and work, including techniques and code, are published openly, the entire world benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:19">[03:59:19]</a>. The creators gain prestige and recognition, while the broader community reaps real benefits from the shared knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:19">[03:59:19]</a>. This collaborative model, often mistakenly viewed as competition, is a form of global cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:19">[03:59:19]</a>.

## Global Collaboration in AI Research

[[Role of Polish contributors in Open AI projects | Good ideas in AI appear everywhere in the world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:44">[04:09:44]</a>. The research community is global, with contributions from various regions. For instance, the first LLaMA model from Meta was created in their Paris lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:13">[04:14:13]</a>, which houses over 100 scientists and has produced many successful projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:13">[04:14:13]</a>. Other significant labs include the one in Montreal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:13">[04:14:13]</a>. There is no single institution or region with a monopoly on good ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:13">[04:14:13]</a>.

China, for example, has produced very innovative work in [[The significance of artificial intelligence | AI]] for a long time, particularly in computer vision, with Chinese scientists making up half of the participants at leading computer vision conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:13">[04:14:13]</a>. Ideas from new Chinese models are quickly adopted and integrated into future versions of systems developed in the U.S., Europe, and the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:13">[04:14:13]</a>. This global exchange of knowledge is the charm of open source and open research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:13">[04:14:13]</a>.

## Impact on AI Progress

The rapid progress in [[The significance of artificial intelligence | AI]] over the last decade is precisely due to open research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:19">[03:59:19]</a>. This approach accelerates development across the entire field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:19">[03:59:19]</a>.

## Case Study: PyTorch

Almost the entire [[The significance of artificial intelligence | AI]] industry, at least in the research and development stage, uses PyTorch, an open-source software system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:19">[03:59:19]</a>. PyTorch was initially created by Meta colleagues at FAIR and later by the wider community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:19">[03:59:19]</a>. Ownership was transferred to the Linux Foundation, making it community-managed, although Meta remains a major contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:19">[03:59:19]</a>. Companies like [[Microsofts partnership with Open AI | Microsoft]], Nvidia, and even [[Open AI]] and Anthropic utilize PyTorch, with academic research also heavily relying on it; it's mentioned in about 70% of relevant publications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:19">[03:59:19]</a>. This widespread adoption exemplifies how progress in [[The significance of artificial intelligence | AI]] is based on the mutual use of others' work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:19">[03:59:19]</a>.

## Contrast with Closed Approaches

While open research is prevalent, some companies operate with more secrecy. [[Open AI]], for example, has never fully adopted an open approach, keeping everything a secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:19">[03:59:19]</a>. Google, which previously had partial openness, has become partially closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:19">[03:59:19]</a>. This closed approach can exclude many people from the research community, hindering overall progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:19">[03:59:19]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker emphasizes that open research and open-source software are crucial for the continued rapid development of [[The significance of artificial intelligence | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:19">[03:59:19]</a>.

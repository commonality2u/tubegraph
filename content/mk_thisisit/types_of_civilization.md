The classification of civilizations is a theoretical framework used by physicists to categorize advanced societies based on their energy consumption and technological capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. This framework includes Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 civilizations, with humanity currently considered a "Type 0" civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Civilization Types

### Type 0 Civilization
Humanity is currently classified as a Type 0 civilization, meaning there is "no place for us" on the scale of advanced civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. In terms of technology, humanity's result is approximately 0.7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Type 1 Civilization
A Type 1 civilization is one that has mastered all the energy of its home planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This includes controlling everything on the planet, utilizing all light from the sun, and managing phenomena like earthquakes and volcanoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Technically, a Type 1 civilization allows for traversing its solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. It is unlikely that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) would come from a Type 1 civilization, as they can only colonize several planets in their region of the solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

### Type 2 Civilization
A Type 2 civilization utilizes the power of both its planet and its sun, controlling all the sun's energy to power its machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. An example from science fiction is the Federation of Planets in *Star Trek*, which would be considered a Type 2 civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. While Type 2 civilizations begin to understand the nature of stars, even this level does not allow for approaching the speed of light needed for universal travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### Type 3 Civilization
A Type 3 civilization possesses a galactic character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Such a civilization travels along galactic routes and can interact with black holes, similar to depictions in *Star Wars* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This type of civilization may have access to "Plank energy," the largest energy in the universe where the universe itself loses stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

#### Plank Energy and Space-Time Manipulation
Plank energy is defined as 10 to 19 billion electron volts, or one with 19 zeros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This energy is necessary to create warp drives by bending or cutting holes in spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

Calculations suggest that a Type 3 civilization would possess the energy to bend spacetime and potentially even build a time machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. When Plank energy is present, spacetime anomalies, or "bubbles," begin to form, leading to what Stephen Hawking termed "spacetime foam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This phenomenon occurs when space becomes unstable at unimaginably high temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. The Big Bang itself could be understood as a bubble that reached Plank energy and then expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The environment of a Type 3 civilization could potentially use this as a gateway for space travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Implications for Alien Visits
If aliens were to visit Earth, it is believed they would be a Type 3 civilization, roughly 100,000 years more advanced than Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Such a civilization, developing exponentially, would have reached Plank energy within that timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

However, the speaker suggests that if intelligent beings from outer space were to meet humans, they might find us "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Humans have little to offer them, as resources like gold and silver would likely have no value to their advanced civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. They might view humanity as a "curiosity," studying and analyzing us until they become bored, much like humans do not spend extensive time interacting with animals to learn their secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Evidence of Alien Contact
While many UFO observations exist, approximately 95% are suitable for rejection, leaving about 5% that are "hair-raising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. These 5% include observations made by multiple witnesses using different technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

However, the "gold standard" for proving intelligent life in the universe is not just observing flying saucers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Despite numerous observations, no tangible evidence has been found, such as alien technology or a captured alien <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The speaker emphasizes the need for tangible evidence:
> "I tell them that the next time they are abducted by aliens for God's sake steal something anything a spaceship an alien hammer a transistor Anything that will serve as tangible evidence confirming a visit to a Flying Saucer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

Currently, there is no such proof, no "repeatable multiple evidence using various methods that will confirm without a doubt contact with a technologically advanced civilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Recent claims by former military personnel before the U.S. parliament regarding government evidence of unidentified objects, alien technology, and bodies have not been personally substantiated by those making the claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The speaker maintains an open mind but stresses the lack of "hard evidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

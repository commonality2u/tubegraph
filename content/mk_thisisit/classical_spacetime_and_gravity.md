Physicist Nikodem Popławski holds a distinct view on the nature of [[geometry_and_spacetime | spacetime]] and gravity, asserting that [[geometry_and_spacetime | spacetime]] is fundamentally classical, rather than quantum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. He postulates that there will be no [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum theory of gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, and is unconcerned by its absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

His core belief is that the curvature of [[geometry_and_spacetime | spacetime]] *is* gravity, considering it a fundamental aspect of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. In this classical [[geometry_and_spacetime | spacetime]], matter itself is quantized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, interacting through quantum interactions and the three other fundamental forces: electromagnetism, and the weak and strong forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He explicitly states that there are no gravitons, which are hypothesized as carriers of gravity in quantum gravity theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Classical Spacetime vs. Quantum Gravity

Popławski critiques the approach of [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum gravity]] researchers who posit gravitons. He argues that if [[geometry_and_spacetime | spacetime]] is fundamentally flat, as implied by a graviton-based model, then the existence of phenomena like black holes—which are characterized by extreme [[geometry_and_spacetime | spacetime]] curvature—is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. He maintains that [[geometry_and_spacetime | spacetime]] curvature is primary, not an averaged effect of gravitons from a quantum theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This perspective resonates with Sir Roger Penrose's idea of the "gravity of [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum mechanics]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Penrose suggests that gravity itself causes the collapse of the wave function, meaning a particle's wave function is curved by [[geometry_and_spacetime | spacetime]], and stronger gravity leads to faster collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This contrasts with quantum mechanics' probabilistic nature, where particles exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Popławski supports the view that [[geometry_and_spacetime | spacetime]] is classical and that matter within it is quantized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Bridging Classical and Quantum Physics

The apparent disconnect between the non-deterministic quantum world and the deterministic classical world of Newtonian physics is a significant [[challenges_in_quantum_physics_and_gravity | challenge in quantum physics and gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Popławski acknowledges this as a very interesting issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. He highlights historical unifications in physics, such as Newton's unification of terrestrial and celestial physics, Maxwell's unification of electricity, magnetism, and light, Dirac's combination of special [[relativity_and_quantum_gravity | relativity and quantum gravity]], and Einstein's connection of matter, [[geometry_and_spacetime | spacetime]], and gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Central to Popławski's approach to the [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | interplay between classical and quantum physics]] is his support for the **De Broglie-Bohm theory** (also known as the pilot wave hypothesis) of [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | Quantum Mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. In this interpretation:
*   The wave function is a real entity, a solution to Dirac or Schrödinger equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   Particles are not waves; they are small, distinct entities (not necessarily point-like) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   Crucially, particles exist at only one point at a time; they are not in several places at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   There is no "collapse of the wave function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The wave function always exists and guides the particle's movement, much like a surfer rides a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

This hypothesis explains quantum phenomena like the double-slit experiment's interference pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The wave function goes through both slits, setting the conditions for interference, and a tiny initial change in a particle's position can lead to a large, chaotic difference in its final position on the screen. Since initial positions cannot be measured without tiny errors, the final position becomes probabilistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Black Holes, Big Bounce, and Inflation

Popławski's most significant scientific contributions revolve around his theory that black holes create new universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This idea was recognized by National Geographic and Science magazine as one of the top ten most important of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Morgan Freeman even called him the "second Copernicus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

His theory suggests that a mechanism involving the twisting of [[geometry_and_spacetime | spacetime]] prevents [[general_relativity_and_singularities | singularities]] from forming inside black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Instead of a singularity, the collapsing matter stops and "bounces" (the "Big Bounce"), leading to the expansion of a new universe within the black hole's event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

Key aspects of this model:
*   **Twisting of [[geometry_and_spacetime | spacetime]]**: Popławski's work, published in 2016 and 2021, incorporated Cartan's idea of torsion in [[geometry_and_spacetime | spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. While this torsion is almost zero at normal densities, it becomes very strong at extreme densities (like those near a Big Bang or [[general_relativity_and_singularities | singularity]]), acting as repulsive gravity and preventing the [[general_relativity_and_singularities | singularity]] from forming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This is the mechanism for the Big Bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
*   **Quantum Production of Pairs**: The immense mass of a new universe originates from the quantum production of particle-antiparticle pairs in the extremely hot, dense state of collapsing matter inside the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. This process is analogous to Hawking radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Cyclical Expansion and Inflation**: Popławski proposes that this new universe, initially a closed space, might undergo several cycles of expansion and collapse (bounces), with each bounce creating more matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Eventually, a cycle could reach a size where the cosmological constant's influence (proportional to volume) dominates, causing the universe to expand infinitely rather than re-collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Natural Inflation**: Crucially, Popławski demonstrates that combining the twisting of [[geometry_and_spacetime | spacetime]] with the quantum production of particle-antiparticle pairs naturally leads to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. This provides a natural explanation for the universe's early exponential expansion, addressing issues like the horizon and flatness problems, and the large-scale structure of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Unlike existing inflation theories that rely on hypothetical scalar fields and multiple parameters, Popławski's model uses only one parameter (potentially derivable from a grander theory) and predicts an inflation that is finite and self-ending, without requiring additional hypothetical fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

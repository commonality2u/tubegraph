The concept of [[nature_of_free_will_and_determinism|free will]] is extensively debated, particularly in the context of biological determinism and [[Quantum Mechanics and Relativity|quantum physics]]. The speaker believes that [[nature_of_free_will_and_determinism|free will]] does not exist, arguing that humans are "biological machines" [00:00:30]. Our actions and values are the result of our biological history and uncontrollable interactions with the environment [00:01:59].

## The Argument Against Free Will
The speaker asserts that humans are complex biological machines, similar to a worm, a monkey, or a tree [00:00:34]. Our neurons are indistinguishable from those of a fly under a microscope [00:00:38], implying a fundamental shared biological basis. Human behavior, whether deemed "good" or "bad," is explained by a multitude of factors, ranging from immediate brain activity, sensory stimuli, and hormone levels (e.g., morning hormone levels) [00:03:41] to longer-term influences like trauma, depression, puberty, childhood experiences, fetal life, genetics, and even the evolution of the species [00:04:03]. The combination of all these elements, from a second ago to millions of years ago, leaves no room for freedom of action [00:04:36].

This deterministic view suggests that blaming or punishing individuals, or even praising and rewarding them, makes no sense, as their actions are simply the result of preceding events beyond their control [00:05:04]. Society must still protect itself from dangerous individuals, but this should be done without attributing moral blame or responsibility, akin to removing a car with faulty brakes from the road [00:06:32].

The idea that a low IQ can exempt someone from the [[death_penalty|death penalty]] due to an inability to distinguish good from evil highlights this point [00:09:33]. The speaker argues that if a person with an IQ of 70 is not guilty, then all individuals, shaped by a "billion different things" from conception onward, equally lack control over their actions [00:10:32].

### Biological Intervention
Every day, humans demonstrate their nature as biological machines through biological interventions that alter their functioning [00:24:58]. For example, drinking coffee affects brain neurochemistry, influencing concentration and working memory [00:25:03]. Similarly, growing up in poverty significantly increases the risk of behavioral control issues due to chronic stress affecting brain development [00:25:25]. These daily occurrences and societal observations serve as "thousands of proofs" that humans are biological machines [00:25:48].

## Quantum Physics and Free Will
Some argue that [[quantum physics and consciousness|quantum physics]], with its inherent non-determinism and uncertainty, might provide a basis for [[concept_of_free_will_in_quantum_physics|free will]] [00:26:02]. The existence of "many possible futures" [00:00:59] in the quantum world, where causality and determinism do not dominate, is seen as a tempting link to [[quantum mechanics and consciousness|consciousness]] and [[concept_of_free_will_in_quantum_physics|free will]] [00:26:42]. Many physicists acknowledge the non-deterministic nature of the quantum realm [00:26:54].

However, the speaker refutes this connection for several reasons:
1.  **Scale Mismatch:** [[Quantum uncertainty]] operates at the subatomic level. For a quantum event to affect the oscillation of a single molecule in a neuron, it would require an amplification of 23 orders of magnitude, which is highly unlikely to impact behavior [00:27:11].
2.  **Mathematical Impossibility:** It is mathematically impossible for all necessary quantum events to occur simultaneously in a way that would coherently affect behavior [00:27:56].
3.  **Randomness vs. Agency:** Even if quantum events *could* influence brain function, they would produce *random* behavior, not the purposeful and morally guided behavior associated with [[concept_of_free_will_in_quantum_physics|free will]] [00:28:25]. The popular understanding of [[concept_of_free_will_and_consciousness|free will]] involves a "moral compass," not arbitrary actions [00:28:31].
4.  **Lack of Empirical Support:** The notion that a higher level of functioning, such as [[quantum_mechanics_and_consciousness|consciousness]], could "reach down" and utilize [[quantum_uncertainty|quantum uncertainty]] to produce desired behavior is dismissed as a "fairy tale" that "doesn't work that way" [00:29:05].

In summary, while [[Quantum Mechanics and Relativity|quantum uncertainty]] is "the most amazing thing you can imagine" [00:00:46], it operates on a fundamentally different scale and has no bearing on the actions of neurons or the human brain [00:30:24].

## Chaos Theory and Its Relation to Quantum Physics
[[Chaos Theory and Its Relation to Quantum Physics|Chaos theory]], exemplified by the "butterfly effect" (sensitive dependence on initial conditions) [00:01:03], implies that many things can never be predicted with certainty [00:31:43]. This inherent unpredictability, however, is distinct from a lack of determinism [00:32:11]. A chaotic system is still deterministic; its future states are uniquely determined by its current state, even if they are practically unpredictable [00:42:11]. Therefore, [[Chaos Theory and Its Relation to Quantum Physics|chaos theory]] does not provide a basis for [[nature_of_free_will_and_determinism|free will]] because unpredictability does not equate to non-determinism [00:32:38].

## Relationship Between Free Will and Consciousness
The speaker believes there is no relationship between [[nature_of_free_will_and_determinism|free will]] and [[quantum_mechanics_and_consciousness|human consciousness]] [00:32:54]. Whether actions are conscious or unconscious, they are underpinned by the same biological mechanisms [00:33:12]. While humans have a nervous system capable of creating [[the_role_of_quantum_mechanics_in_understanding_consciousness|consciousness]] and fish do not, the underlying mechanisms for their behavior remain the same [00:33:27]. The speaker also admits a lack of understanding regarding the nature of [[the_role_of_quantum_mechanics_in_understanding_consciousness|consciousness]] itself, but maintains that this issue does not affect the argument against [[nature_of_free_will_and_determinism|free will]] [00:33:52].

## Societal Implications of Rejecting Free Will
Despite the speaker's firm conviction that [[nature_of_free_will_and_determinism|free will]] does not exist, they acknowledge that it is difficult for humanity to fully accept this idea and behave accordingly [00:34:33]. Most people continue to act "as if there was [[nature_of_free_will_and_determinism|free will]]" [00:34:45].

However, history provides precedents for societal shifts away from attributing blame or agency to individuals for phenomena now understood to have biological or environmental causes:
*   **Witchcraft and Weather:** Societies once believed witches controlled weather, leading to the burning of old women during storms [00:35:11]. Understanding that weather is not controlled by individuals led to a "much happier" world [00:35:44].
*   **Epilepsy and Demonic Possession:** Epileptic seizures were once attributed to demonic possession or sleeping with Satan [00:35:54]. The understanding of epilepsy as a neurological disorder with a biological basis, like diabetes, led to a more humane approach [00:36:01].
*   **Dyslexia and Laziness:** Children with dyslexia were once labeled "stupid and lazy" [00:37:17]. Recognizing dyslexia as a neurodevelopmental difficulty, where the brain works differently, led to better teaching methods and prevented children from internalizing negative self-perceptions [00:37:31].

Each time society has moved to a new level of understanding the mechanisms of action, acknowledging that certain behaviors are not due to [[nature_of_free_will_and_determinism|free will]] or personal fault, the world has become a better place [00:39:30]. This suggests that a broader acceptance of biological determinism could similarly lead to a more compassionate and just society.

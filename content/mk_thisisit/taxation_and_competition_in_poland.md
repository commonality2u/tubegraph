Poland faces unique challenges and opportunities regarding taxation and market competition, particularly for its domestic businesses. There's a strong belief in the Polish entrepreneurial spirit, yet a perceived lack of global brands highlights underlying issues within the economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:05">[03:16:05]</a>.

## Unfair Tax Burden

Polish companies, such as InPost, report paying increasingly high taxes to the state budget each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. In contrast, foreign competitors operating in the Polish market often pay lower or even no taxes, despite achieving very similar revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This disparity creates an uneven playing field, where foreign entities may accumulate tax benefits in their home markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This situation makes it difficult for domestic firms to compete effectively and hinders their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## The Polish Entrepreneurial Gene

Despite the challenges, there is a strong belief in the "Polish entrepreneurial gene" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:05">[01:36:05]</a>. This is supported by metrics showing the high number of companies created and recreated, and the fact that over 70% of Poland's GDP is generated by Polish private businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. However, only 18% of society is aware of this significant contribution, with many believing state-owned companies and the public sector are the primary economic drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

### Culture of Overwork and its Impact
A "culture of disgusting work ethic" has been criticized, particularly by those who advocate for extreme activist, left-wing views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This culture, which cultivates overwork, is seen as detrimental, as it "kills the gene of entrepreneurship, hard work, and work ethic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This decline in the culture of hard work over the last decade is considered a significant factor hindering [[challenges_of_entrepreneurship_and_innovation_in_poland | entrepreneurial development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### The Domestic Market Trap
Unlike smaller countries like the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia, and Finland, which have developed world-famous technology brands, Poland's large domestic market has been identified as a "trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This large internal market has allowed Polish businesses to grow to substantial sizes within Poland without needing to expand internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. This changes the mindset of entrepreneurs, institutions, and government, as there's less immediate pressure to export and compete on a global scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. However, this is changing as the domestic market becomes insufficient for continued growth, forcing companies like InPost to look abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions: Deregulation and Systemic Change

To foster [[economic_potential_and_aspirations_for_poland | economic growth]] and a more competitive environment, several key [[deregulation_and_philanthropy_in_poland | deregulation and philanthropy in Poland]] proposals are being advocated:

*   **Presumption of Citizen Innocence in Administrative Disputes**: A fundamental change proposes that citizens are presumed innocent in administrative disputes with the state, shifting the burden of proof to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This aims to protect citizens from bureaucratic overreach and simplify interactions with the state machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Enforcing Instructional Deadlines**: Polish law contains over 20,000 instructional deadlines, which state bureaucratic machines fail to meet in over 80% of cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Proposed changes suggest that if these deadlines are not met, there should be "tacit consent" from the taxpayer for the decision to be issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This would unblock the energy of entrepreneurs, citizens, and scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   **Speedy Trials and Judicial Reform**: The right to a speedy trial, a constitutional principle, is often not met due to long delays in obtaining hearing dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Simple provisions are proposed to prevent 70% of economic cases from reaching the courts at all, utilizing methods like KSEF enforcement titles, mediation, and notarial orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. The abolition of "locational jurisdiction" would also allow cases to be handled by courts in smaller urban centers, reducing waiting times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

These changes are seen as crucial to creating the best possible conditions for creating and developing businesses in Poland, turning it into an "incubator for global projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The belief is that businesses must first succeed domestically before conquering international markets, akin to Spotify's growth from Sweden to global dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

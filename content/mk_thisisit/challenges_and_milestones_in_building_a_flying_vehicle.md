The development of a personal flying vehicle, like the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]], has involved overcoming numerous [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry | challenges]] and achieving significant milestones, from initial concept to market readiness and regulatory approvals.

## Early Development and Vision

The idea for the [[jetson_one_as_a_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] stemmed from a childhood dream of flying a self-built vehicle and a lifelong passion for aviation, nurtured by designing and building remote-controlled aircraft models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. This passion evolved from building larger remote-controlled helicopters and drones for aerial filming services in 2007-2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>, leading to the realization that a large, electric, single-person drone could be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.

### Initial Hurdles and Proof of Concept
The journey began with conversations about the possibility of placing a person in such a device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. Technical drawings for a "proof of concept" vehicle were prepared, designed for easy and quick testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. A key decision was moving to Italy to leverage its more favorable climate for outdoor testing year-round, as opposed to Poland's seasonal limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. The first prototype was built on a very small budget of several thousand dollars in just three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>. The first flight was "mega exciting" and successful, though initially unexpected bodily sensations during control surprised the pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.

## Funding and Business Development

The project faced financial [[challenges_and_innovations_in_the_aviation_startup_industry | challenges]], with money running out and the cost of living in Italy proving higher than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a>. This led to a temporary return to Poland and the sale of a personal car to continue financing the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>. The realization emerged that there would be only one chance to execute the project correctly, emphasizing the need for flawlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>.

### Securing Investment
Attracting investors was difficult, as few people initially understood or believed in such "bold unrealistic projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>. The first investor was found in the United States, where the attitude towards such ventures was different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>. A significant financial milestone was the closing of a $15 million funding round, which helped finance the company's registration in the U.S. and Italy, as well as the rebuilding of the production facility in Tuscany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>. This investment also allowed for the hiring of new employees, with the team growing to about 30 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:00">[22:08:00]</a>.

## Production and Regulatory Milestones

The goal is to launch production and deliver the [[jetson_one_as_a_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] to customers, with low-series production planned in Italy, followed by large-scale, more scalable production in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>.

### Certification and Operation
A crucial milestone was obtaining certification in Italy, the first of its kind globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. This certification allows the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]], classified as a single-person ultralight personal flying vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, to be flown in uncontrolled airspace (outside airports and major cities) across Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. This also included securing permits for remote-controlled flights, enabling safer testing without exposing pilots to unnecessary risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

In the United States, the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] falls under Part 103 ultralight regulations, meaning it does not require a pilot's license to fly after undergoing company training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. Poland's aviation law also mirrors U.S. regulations (UL 115 class), allowing the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] to be flown there after training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. These [[regulations_and_certification_for_flying_vehicles_in_europe_and_united_states | regulatory achievements]] are vital first steps towards wider European adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The company aims for [[jetson_one_as_a_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] to become "the Tesla of flying vehicles," expanding beyond personal flight to include other [[potential_applications_and_future_development_of_flying_vehicles | transport solutions]] and fostering [[innovation_and_entrepreneurship_in_aviation_technologies | innovation]] in various fields, similar to Tesla's diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:18:00">[34:18:00]</a>.

### Global Impact and Community
The initial promotional video for the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] went viral, garnering 10 million views in seven days and demonstrating global interest beyond initial sales expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>. This widespread reception affirmed the vision of personal electric flight and its potential to capture the world's imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:00">[36:31:00]</a>. The company intends to continue developing its product and exploring its [[potential_applications_and_future_development_of_flying_vehicles | possibilities]], with a focus on safety and future innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:45:00">[36:45:00]</a>.

### Educational Initiatives
As part of its long-term vision, the company plans to establish the world's first school for pilots of flying cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:28:00">[25:28:00]</a>. This initiative aims to simplify the path to piloting such vehicles, reducing the typical year-long, high-cost PPL (Private Pilot License) course to a two or three-day training program for [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

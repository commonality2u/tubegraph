Chaos theory, often associated with the [[predictability_and_the_butterfly_effect | Butterfly Effect]], explores systems where small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Professor Adam Kanigowski, winner of the European Mathematical Society's main prize, discusses this field, emphasizing that while theoretically the future might be "written," practical limitations prevent absolute prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Butterfly Effect and Predictability

The core concept of chaos theory, the [[predictability_and_the_butterfly_effect | Butterfly Effect]], posits that a minimal disturbance from an actual state can lead to an "absolutely different future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This means if we knew all parameters with infinite precision, we could theoretically know the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. However, this is practically unattainable due to inevitable measurement errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Chaos as Divergence, Not Disorder
Despite its name, chaos in this context doesn't imply disorder but rather a deterministic system whose predicted state diverges significantly from its actual state over time due to minuscule initial discrepancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The "chaos" appears when predictions diverge, but the underlying "law itself" can be seen as an order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

> "The butterfly effect is exactly this that the minimum disturbance from the actual state causes an absolutely different future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Applications of Chaos Theory

Chaos theory finds applications in various fields, describing one of many possible ways systems evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Weather Prediction
The [[predictability_and_the_butterfly_effect | Butterfly Effect]] originated from the work of mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz, who discovered the impossibility of long-term weather prediction due to deterministic chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Even a minimal temperature or wind force disturbance can have colossal consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The accuracy of measurement directly impacts the duration of predictability; for instance, a measurement accurate to one millionth can extend weather predictability to three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Economic Markets
The principles of chaos theory can also be applied to predicting movements in stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. However, due to the high number of variables, analysis often shifts towards [[historical_and_mathematical_perspectives_on_chaos_theory | probability theory]] to understand what will happen with a high degree of likelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

### Biological Evolution
In the study of species development, a minimal disturbance in initial conditions, akin to the Butterfly Effect, can determine the survival or extinction of competing species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### Celestial Mechanics: The N-Body Problem
The N-body problem, dating back to Newton, involves describing the movement of multiple celestial bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. While the two-body problem (e.g., Earth-Moon) has a known solution, the three-body problem (e.g., Earth-Sun-Moon) is notoriously difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Even with precise trajectories, celestial body movements cannot be predicted beyond approximately 2 million years due to the system's sensitivity to initial conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## [[chaos_theory_and_its_relation_to_quantum_physics | Chaos Theory and Its Relation to Quantum Physics]]

Chaos theory has been successfully developed primarily within the framework of Newtonian physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. However, connecting it with [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum physics]] is a more nascent area for mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

### Determinism vs. Non-determinism
Classical physics often assumes a deterministic world, where if all initial parameters are known, the future is fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] introduces non-determinism, with phenomena like particles existing in multiple places simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. The relationship between the classical and quantum worlds remains largely unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

### Quantum Unic Ergodicity
One hypothesis in [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum physics]] is "Quantum unic ergodicity," which suggests that beyond the ambiguity principle (inability to predict both position and velocity at once), if velocity is known, position is "evenly distributed," meaning there's zero information about the exact position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

## The Nature of Mathematics: Discovered or Created?

Professor Kanigowski believes that "good mathematics" is discovered, not created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. He views mathematics as providing a deep understanding of observable phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Differential calculus, for example, is seen as a discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This perspective aligns with the idea that mathematical truths exist independently and are uncovered by researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Future of Predictability and Research

The future of predictability hinges on increasing measurement precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The rate at which information is lost in chaotic systems is exponential, governed by the Lyapunov exponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

### Slow Chaos
Professor Kanigowski's research, which earned him the European Mathematical Society prize, focuses on deterministic chaos, specifically "slow chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. In slow chaos, information is lost at a polynomial rate, which is significantly slower than exponential loss, allowing for more investigation with less precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. The goal is to maximize predictability with a minimum amount of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

### Role of Artificial Intelligence
There is a potential [[future_implications_and_applications_of_ai_technology | future implication]] for AI to assist in mathematical proofs by identifying causal reasoning steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. However, concerns exist about AI's eventual ability to prove entire theorems independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

### Optimization Theory
While chaos theory highlights unpredictability, optimization theory, a field of mathematics, offers a way to manage future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. It focuses on making optimal corrections at each step to steer a system towards an expected result, even if initial conditions are imperfectly known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.

## Chaos Theory in Pop Culture

The concept of the Butterfly Effect has permeated pop culture, notably through the film *The Butterfly Effect* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. This cultural adoption stems from the universal human desire to understand the consequences of seemingly insignificant daily decisions on the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

> "every day we make a lot of small seemingly insignificant decisions and we want to know what they will be we would like to know what consequences they will have in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

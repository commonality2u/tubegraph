## Professor Dawid Kielak: A Polish Mathematician at Oxford
Professor Dawid Kielak of the Institute of Mathematics at the University of Oxford is a Polish mathematician whose work is changing the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. He attained his professorship at Oxford through a combination of luck and skill, having written articles that were appreciated and noticed within the mathematical community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. A key factor was an opening at Oxford in his specific area of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Key Mathematical Contributions
Professor Kielak's work involves solving problems and finding proofs for theorems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. He states that he has found "a few such proofs," but is more proud of some than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

### The Theorem on Fiberization
His most important statement is the theorem on fiberization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This work seeks to understand the world in a way similar to Albert Einstein, who observed that humans live in a four-dimensional space, yet perceive themselves as three-dimensional beings that change over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

Kielak's mathematical description uses the concept of "fiberization on a circle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This means that four-dimensional space-time "fiberizes" over a circle, implying it can be understood as a one-dimensionally lower space that changes in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. His research focuses on identifying algebraic properties of a given space to determine if it can be simplified and understood as a dynamically changing, less complicated system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. For example, if a certain algebraic invariant (a number derived from the space) is zero, the space will fiberize; if not, it won't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

Kielak arrived at this discovery by reading existing literature, building "on the shoulders of giants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. He particularly focused on an article presenting a proof for a similar theorem in a specific case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. Being more of an algebraist, he noticed the algebra used by the original topologist and figured out how to generalize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This particular article was instrumental in his appointment at Oxford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

While the immediate practical application of this specific theorem isn't obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>, Kielak draws a parallel to Isaac Newton's invention of differential calculus, which took centuries to be fully applied across science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Similarly, Alan Turing's work on computation did not immediately lead to particle collision simulations or the atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### The Whitehead Prize
Professor Kielak is the only Pole to have received the Whitehead Prize from the London Mathematical Society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. This award recognizes the entirety of a mathematician's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. The theorem on fiberization is one of the two main pillars responsible for this award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. The other pillar is a theorem related to the property of Grunwald motorists' groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

### Symmetry of All Symmetries
This discovery, also known as the "symmetry of all symmetries," was a joint effort involving the University of Oxford, the [[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Polish Academy of Sciences]] in Warsaw, and a colleague likely based in Berlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

In group theory, mathematicians study symmetries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. An object's symmetries are described by a "group," which is a collection of all its possible symmetries (e.g., rotating a table by 180 degrees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Symmetries are ubiquitous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

Kielak's research specifically examines a "free group," which represents a universal or "greatest" symmetry, a "bag of all possible symmetry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. He explains that even these "bags of symmetries" have their own symmetries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. This "symmetry of all symmetries" has practical applications, particularly in algorithmics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>, for example, in producing random elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. This discovery of generating random elements is considered a significant advancement in 20th-century mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

## Views on Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Professor Kielak offers a nuanced perspective on AI, particularly regarding large language models like ChatGPT.

### ChatGPT and its Limitations
Kielak is somewhat skeptical about ChatGPT's immediate revolutionary nature, noting that the third version does not yet cope with mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. He acknowledges that GPT will "definitely change" things, but doubts it will bring changes on the scale of the internet's emergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. He feels it's too early to definitively assess its full impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. Currently, machines still produce "nonsense" in mathematical contexts, which needs to be verified by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

### Artificial Consciousness
Kielak is optimistic about the possibility of transferring the human brain to a machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. However, he believes there's a long way to go before we can mathematically describe the brain or simulate even simple animal brains with 200 nerve cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. He estimates this could take 100, 150, or even 200 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

Regarding artificial consciousness, Kielak leans towards functionalism: if a machine acts exactly like a conscious person and affirms its consciousness when asked, then for him, the topic is essentially resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>. He references the Google engineer who claimed the Bing AI was conscious months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>.

Kielak doubts that AI will develop secret, manipulative tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>. If AI exhibits signs of consciousness, such as trying to prevent itself from being turned off, society has an obligation to grant it subjectivity and rights, similar to ethical considerations for animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>.

### Future Impact on Human Roles
Within ten years, artificial intelligence will likely replace humans in basic language fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. Learning foreign languages, for instance, might become a hobby, similar to studying ancient Greek today, as translation will be seamless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.

When AI can assist mathematicians by quickly verifying the correctness of statements, it will dramatically improve their work by automating the laborious parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. However, if AI reaches a stage where it can autonomously find all steps to prove a theorem from a starting point, the mathematician's role might shift to primarily defining the initial problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>. The ability to communicate with AI using natural language is already a solved problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>.

## The State of Mathematics
Mathematics faces profound challenges, often encapsulated in the Millennium Problems.

### Millennium Problems
Currently, there are six remaining Millennium Problems, problems that are at the core of modern mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>. They motivate mathematicians, but most do not work on them directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. These problems developed over centuries, becoming central to the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>. When a deep, old problem is solved, it typically introduces new tools and methods that excite the mathematical community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:00]</a>.

One of the solved Millennium Problems is the Poincar√© conjecture, solved by Grigori Perelman, who famously refused the associated million-dollar prize and retreated from the mathematical community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>.

Other notable Millennium Problems include:
*   **Riemann Hypothesis:** A fundamental hypothesis in number theory concerning the arrangement of prime numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>.
*   **P versus NP problem:** This asks whether problems whose solutions can be quickly *checked* can also be quickly *solved* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>. A classic example is the "traveling salesman problem," finding the shortest route visiting multiple cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>. While most mathematicians believe P does not equal NP (meaning checking is faster than solving), it remains unproven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:00">[24:22:00]</a>. This highlights a unique aspect of mathematics: a community can be convinced of a truth, but it remains unproven until a rigorous proof exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>.

## Polish Mathematics and Education

### Oxford vs. Polish Universities
Professor Kielak considers the Institute of Mathematics at Oxford to be a "very good top world faculty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:00">[25:03:00]</a>, particularly excelling in the geometric theory of groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:54:00">[25:54:00]</a>. While his direct experience with Polish universities is short, having spent only two months at the [[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Polish Academy of Sciences]] in Warsaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>, he notes that there are no "diametric differences" between Polish and foreign universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:00">[25:46:00]</a>.

The [[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Polish Academy of Sciences]] in Warsaw, in particular, is at a "fantastic level" and is a "completely global entity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>, also at a "fantastic level" today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:45:00">[29:45:00]</a>. [[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Polish mathematicians]] are actively involved in the global mathematical community, operating at the same level as their international counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>. Kielak states that Poland should not be "ashamed" of its mathematical contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21:00">[30:21:00]</a>.

A significant advantage of the [[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Polish Academy of Sciences]] is that researchers are not required to teach, allowing them to focus more on scientific work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:00">[26:33:00]</a>.

### Challenges for Polish Science
Professor Kielak believes the biggest problem for [[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Polish science]] is poor salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>. While European academic salaries are not sensational, they are better in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11:00">[27:11:00]</a>. The issue arises when it's difficult to assure promising students that a career in mathematics in Poland will provide an acceptable standard of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>. Universities cannot compete with salaries offered by finance or tech companies like Google or Open AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>. When academia falls too far behind, it becomes problematic to encourage the next generation into scientific careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:00">[28:08:00]</a>.

### Advice for Aspiring Mathematicians
For young people aspiring to study mathematics at top universities like Oxford, the most trivial but essential advice is to "do a lot of math tasks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:53:00">[28:53:00]</a>. Kielak observes that students from East Asia are generally much better prepared for Oxford's entrance exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:00">[29:31:00]</a>.

Kielak stresses the critical importance of mathematical education, particularly for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:00">[30:40:00]</a>. He highlights that computers, created by mathematicians, are designed for mathematical interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:55:00">[30:55:00]</a>. In the next 40 years, individuals who understand algorithms and can communicate effectively with computers will be at a significantly higher social and economic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09:00">[31:09:00]</a>. Mathematics provides excellent training for understanding how this interconnected world functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26:00">[31:26:00]</a>.

He notes that many people incorrectly perceive mathematics as merely calculating sums or integrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:44:00">[31:44:00]</a>. Instead, mathematics is "the language of precision," "the language of science," and "the language of the machine," making it incredibly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>. Academic mathematics is a vast field with far more unsolved problems than solved ones, offering a niche for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:00">[32:07:00]</a>. Even a basic understanding of academic mathematics provides valuable skills applicable in many other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:15:00">[32:15:00]</a>.

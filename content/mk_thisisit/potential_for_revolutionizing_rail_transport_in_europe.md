Poland is pioneering a unique [[levitating_railway_technology | levitating railway]] system called LewMo, which aims to revolutionize rail transport by integrating with [[integration_with_existing_railway_infrastructure | existing railway infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. This technology, developed by the Newmo company, is described as the world's first and is patented for its integration method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The system provides new possibilities for drive and suspension, offering tangible benefits in operational speed, automation, and cost-effectiveness compared to current alternatives like high-speed rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.

## The LewMo System: A Polish Innovation

The LewMo system functions as an overlay on the [[integration_with_existing_railway_infrastructure | existing railway system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>.
### How it Works
The train literally [[levitating_railway_technology | floats]] a few centimeters above the tracks by creating a magnetic cushion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>. This is achieved through passive [[levitating_railway_technology | levitation technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:45">[02:45:45]</a>, using a system of permanent magnets installed on the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:21">[03:21:21]</a>. These magnets move over a "levitation beam" or "levitation table," which is an additional structural element added to the track infrastructure, consisting of aluminum plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:27">[03:27:27]</a>. The vertical levitation force is a side effect of the vehicle's movement over this infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:10">[03:10:10]</a>. A linear drive is also a key component of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:43">[04:43:43]</a>.

### Key Advantages
*   **Cost-Effective Implementation:** The system adapts to [[integration_with_existing_railway_infrastructure | existing railway infrastructure]], eliminating the need to invest in new rails or sleepers, provided the existing infrastructure allows for modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:49">[04:49:49]</a>. This significantly reduces costs compared to building entirely new high-speed lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:03">[02:03:03]</a>.
*   **High Speed:** The target speed for the LewMo train is up to 550 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. While this speed is achievable on straight lines and very long curves, it is unrealistic on tight curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:38">[13:38:38]</a>. However, the system is able to increase speed in curves by up to 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:54">[13:54:54]</a>. A journey from Krakow to Gdańsk, approximately 700 km, could take just over an hour to an hour and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:01">[14:01:01]</a>.
*   **Safety:** Safety at high speeds is ensured through infrastructural separation from the rest of the network, similar to high-speed lines that start and end at stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:51">[05:51:51]</a>. This prevents single-level road-railway intersections and access by outsiders or wild animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:14">[06:14:14]</a>. The system is designed to be absolutely safe, potentially even safer than current railways due to full automation and exclusion of the human factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:04:04">[41:04:04]</a>.
*   **Passenger Comfort:** Railway regulations dictate specific guidelines for passenger comfort regarding acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:28">[14:28:28]</a>. While trains traditionally don't move very fast due to discomfort, LewMo can improve performance while maintaining comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:57">[14:57:57]</a>. Dedicated trains can incorporate features like deep seats, side support, and seat belts, similar to airplanes during take-off, to handle greater acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:04">[15:04:04]</a>.
*   **Environmental Benefits:** Traveling by train is presented as a greener option, better for the planet, and can be competitive with air travel in terms of door-to-door travel time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:26">[23:26:26]</a>.
*   **Direct City-to-City Travel:** Unlike airports, which are often located far from city centers, rail stations are typically integrated, reducing overall travel time and cost for passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:39:39">[24:39:39]</a>.

### Current Status and Future Plans
Newmo has created a prototype and has a 720-meter functional test track in Nowa Sarzyna, Podkarpacie region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:11">[08:11:11]</a>. The project has received 16.5 million zlotys in funding from NCBIR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:24">[18:24:24]</a>.

For passenger transport, the goal is to see a real train with passengers by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:50">[20:50:50]</a>. However, pilot projects with passengers could be ready around 2028 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:55">[21:55:55]</a>. The main challenge for implementation is overcoming regulatory hurdles in the overregulated railway sector, where authorization processes can take 5-10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:26">[21:26:26]</a>.

For freight transport, the situation is different and potentially faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:11">[28:11:11]</a>. Newmo has developed a product called "Il Buster," which uses a linear drive mounted in the middle of the infrastructure to automatically transport freight wagons without a locomotive. This system is not levitating but significantly increases throughput and profitability for freight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:33:33">[28:33:33]</a>.

## Origin and [[comparison_with_hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Comparison with Hyperloop and Maglev systems]]
The idea for LewMo originated from the [[comparison_with_hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Hyperloop]] concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:34">[09:34:34]</a>. A small student team participated in Elon Musk's Hyperloop competition, achieving a top 10 result among hundreds of participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:26">[10:26:26]</a>.

### Addressing Hyperloop and Maglev Challenges
The team realized that [[comparison_with_hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Hyperloop]] and [[comparison_with_hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Maglev]] systems, while functionally similar (minus the vacuum tube for Maglev), face two main problems:
1.  **High Costs:** They require rebuilding entire countries and are comparable in cost to the aviation sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:55">[10:55:55]</a>. For example, revolutionizing the Krakow-Gdańsk route with LewMo technology would cost around 500 million euros, while a [[comparison_with_hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Shinkansen]] system could cost tens of billions of euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:37:37">[29:37:37]</a>.
2.  **Separation from Existing Infrastructure:** These systems are completely separated, meaning passengers lose time benefits getting to isolated stations or airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:18">[11:18:18]</a>.

LewMo's solution leverages elements of [[comparison_with_hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Hyperloop]] technology but implements them on [[integration_with_existing_railway_infrastructure | existing railway infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:10">[12:10:10]</a>. This approach benefits from existing transport corridors, avoiding land acquisition issues, and connects directly to city centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:22">[12:22:22]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities in Europe
### Regulatory Hurdles and Public Perception
Despite its potential, the company faces significant challenges, particularly the "regulation wall" in the railway sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:30">[21:30:30]</a>. This overregulation, driven by a focus on safety and security, slows down the adoption of innovative technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:11">[21:11:11]</a>. For example, approving a new type of railway sleeper can take years, even for minor changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:11">[22:11:11]</a>.

Funding and public perception in Poland have also been difficult, with accusations of scams or misuse of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:38">[18:38:38]</a>. This "price of [[technological_innovations_in_Poland | Polish technical duds]]" makes it challenging to acquire early-stage funds for deep tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:58">[19:58:58]</a>. In contrast, the response to LewMo technology in Western Europe has been much better, with collaborations with three largest infrastructure managers in Europe, but not yet with Polish PKP PLK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:41:41">[26:41:41]</a>.

### Competitive Landscape and Global Ambition
LewMo positions itself as a "European answer to this Chinese attack" in the railway sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:12">[16:12:12]</a>. It possesses a unique technology that the Chinese currently lack, which allows [[comparison_with_hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Maglev]]-derivative systems to be applied within Europe's dense and highly regulated railway network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:32">[16:32:32]</a>. While China can build high-speed [[comparison_with_hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Maglevs]] in new areas, Europe's challenge is to integrate new technologies into existing, complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:06">[17:06:06]</a>.

The company aims to be a "European chance for the revitalization of transport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:24:24">[41:24:24]</a>. Poland is becoming a key transport hub to the east and south-east, and its geopolitical importance is growing, which could attract more investment into its transport infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:42">[34:42:42]</a>. Initiatives like CPK (Central Communication Port) and Rail Baltica are seen as significant support for this transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:19:19">[34:19:19]</a>.

### The Team
The Newmo team originated from a student group that participated in the [[comparison_with_hyperloop_and_maglev_systems | Hyperloop]] competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:35">[31:35:35]</a>. It has since grown to about 60 people, comprising a strong core of engineers, predominantly Polish, with additional members in Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:05:05">[32:05:05]</a>. The team is bolstered by experts with extensive experience in the railway sector, including an advisor who managed the construction of the Transrapid in Shanghai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:45:45">[32:45:45]</a>.

### The Path Forward
To accelerate the adoption of such [[technological_innovations_in_Poland | technologies]], there needs to be greater openness to innovation, especially in Europe, to remain competitive with East Asian advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:18:18">[39:18:18]</a>. The company emphasizes that its advantage lies in the quality and pace of its product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:43:43">[39:43:43]</a>.

While national bans on short-distance flights are not supported, encouraging conscious choices towards greener transport like trains through education and competitive pricing is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>. The railway sector can provide increased capacity needed for economic [[development and future of urban air mobility | development]] and is actively pursuing greener solutions, such as hydrogen locomotives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51:51">[37:51:51]</a>.

The ultimate goal is to integrate the levitating system with conventional rail, providing a seamless and beneficial experience for passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:26">[38:26:26]</a>.

The idea of moving [[possibility_of_faster_than_light_speed | faster than light]] is a logical possibility in physics, despite the seemingly insurmountable barrier of the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Theoretical physicists have explored concepts like [[Warp drives and fasterthanlight travel | warp drives]] and [[Wormholes and spacetime tunnels | wormholes]] as potential methods for traversing vast cosmic distances.

## Theoretical Mechanisms

Two primary theoretical mechanisms are discussed for achieving [[Warp drives and fasterthanlight travel | faster-than-light travel]]:

### Bending Spacetime (Alcubierre Drive)
One method involves bending [[concept of spacetime and time travel | spacetime]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This concept, known as the Alcubierre drive, is based on a solution to Einstein's equations that would allow a region of spacetime to be "squeezed" in front of a spaceship and "expanded" behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, effectively moving the space around the ship faster than light without the ship itself exceeding the local speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This approach is consistent with Einstein's theory of [[Relativity and quantum gravity | relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Wormholes
Another approach involves "cutting a hole" in [[concept of spacetime and time travel | spacetime]] to create a shortcut between two distant points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. These theoretical tunnels are known as [[Wormholes and spacetime tunnels | wormholes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Energy Requirements

The primary challenge for building [[Warp drives and fasterthanlight travel | warp drives]] or [[Wormholes and spacetime tunnels | wormholes]] is the immense energy required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. To achieve these feats, Plank energy is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Currently, particle accelerators can reach trillions of electron volts, but Plank energy is on the order of 10^19 billion electron volts (one with 19 zeros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

This level of energy is characteristic of a Type III civilization on the Kardashev scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. A Type III civilization would potentially have access to such vast amounts of energy, enough to bend [[concept of spacetime and time travel | spacetime]] and potentially even build a [[Time travel and the nature of time | time machine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

### Current Status of Humanity
Humanity is currently considered a Type 0 civilization, meaning we are far from possessing the energy capabilities required for [[Warp drives and fasterthanlight travel | faster-than-light travel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

Poland has developed a "disgusting work ethic" over the last decade, with some extremist groups cultivating a culture of overwork that stifles entrepreneurship, hard work, and work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Rafa≈Ç Brzoska, founder of InPost, states that his company pays increasing taxes to the state budget, while foreign competitors operating in the same market pay lower or no taxes despite similar revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. He personally spends more on philanthropy than he earns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## The Polish Entrepreneurial Gene
A German Business Insider article praises the Polish entrepreneurial gene, suggesting Poland is resilient to external crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Brzoska strongly believes in this gene, citing metrics like the number of new companies and the fact that over 70% of Poland's GDP is generated by Polish private business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. However, only 18% of Polish society is aware of this contribution, with most believing state-owned companies and the public sector are the primary drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

The decline in the culture of hard work over the past decade is attributed to an extreme activist, left-wing movement that mocks those who work diligently, which Brzoska believes "kills the gene of [[challenges_of_entrepreneurship_and_innovation_in_poland|entrepreneurship]], hard work and work ethic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Challenges for Polish Businesses
Despite a population of nearly 40 million, Poland currently lacks a globally recognized technology brand, unlike smaller neighbors such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia (motorization), Estonia, Finland (Nokia, Angry Birds), or Lithuania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Brzoska attributes this to Poland's large domestic market, which has allowed Polish businesses to grow significantly without needing to export. In contrast, smaller countries are forced to export early, which changes the mindset of entrepreneurs and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

However, this "trap" is changing as the domestic market becomes insufficient for growing champions. Examples of Polish companies expanding internationally include Robert Dobrzycki's Mr. Toni and Dark Genzeski's OSHI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Motivation for Philanthropy and Patriotism
Brzoska's commitment to Poland stems from living in the country, having a family, and paying taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. He identifies as a Polish patriot guided by both economic and patriotic attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. He believes those who succeed must support those who have not, as this is the "basis of humanity" and essential for the country's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. He feels compelled to act when bureaucracy kills the gene of [[challenges_of_entrepreneurship_and_innovation_in_poland|entrepreneurship]], [[scientific_progress_and_funding_in_poland|science]], and education, leading to young people leaving Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. His entire professional life has been about "taking the bull by the horns and raising the bar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

Polish businesses, along with Polish society, were among the first to offer help during the war in Ukraine and the flood in Lower Silesia, demonstrating their readiness to step forward in times of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## The Deregulation Initiative
Brzoska is leading a deregulation initiative, which he asserts is not a political game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The proposals primarily target a wide range of citizens and small and medium-sized enterprises, not large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. His goal is to create a professional team to support society and micro-entrepreneurs in deregulation and propose projects to advance Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. He divides his time between InPost and the deregulation project, working extended hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Key Areas for Deregulation
Seven strategic areas are identified for significant change that could "dramatically push the [[economic_potential_and_aspirations_for_poland|development of Poland]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>:

1.  **Presumption of Citizen Innocence:** A fundamental shift where citizens are presumed innocent in administrative disputes with the state, requiring the state to prove guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This contrasts with current civil and administrative proceedings where citizens are in a "lost position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Over 13,000 proposals have been submitted to the initiative's website, with 70% from citizens, painting a "dark picture" of their struggles with the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
2.  **Instructional Deadlines:** Addressing the issue of over 20,000 instructional deadlines in Polish law that are not met by the state bureaucratic machine in over 80% of cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. The proposed principle is that if a deadline is not met, there should be "the taxpayer's tacit consent to the issuance of this decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.
3.  **Right to a Speedy Trial:** Ensuring the constitutional right to a speedy trial, as disputes currently drag on for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. Six simple provisions are proposed to prevent 70% of economic cases from reaching the courts at all, utilizing methods like KSEF enforcement titles, mediation, notarial orders, and extrajudicial enforcement for undisputed invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. The abolition of locational jurisdiction is also proposed to allow cases to be considered in smaller urban centers with shorter waiting times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

## Fostering Global Companies and Talent Retention
To establish global companies in Poland, the focus must be on creating the best possible conditions for starting and developing businesses domestically, serving as an "incubator for global projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. The current tax disparity where foreign competitors pay less or no taxes while operating in Poland is a barrier to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

Brzoska actively supports young people through scholarships, even acknowledging that some might use these opportunities to study abroad. However, he believes that 85% of these students, through the example set by his foundation, will recognize Poland as their home and proudly return to contribute, ensuring that their achievements bear the "Polish flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. He feels that if a Polish foundation enables their education and personal development, there is a higher chance they will "give-back" to Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

## Mentorship and Education
Brzoska's father, despite being deceased for 11 years, remains his "master" and a champion, having instilled key maxims that guide him today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. A master serves as a guide, prompting the question, "What would he or she do in my place?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. He also credits a demanding and versatile primary school principal who taught him various subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.

Regarding Polish school education systems, Brzoska believes continuous change is necessary to adapt the curriculum to the rapidly changing reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. While there is room for improvement, he cautions against calling the system a "disaster," noting that his scholarship holders, all educated in Poland, compete well with peers from the Netherlands, Great Britain, and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

## Advice to Young People and Combating Hate
Brzoska advises young people to embrace ambition, work hard, and be proud of being Poles, calling it "the greatest undiscovered value in our society today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. He encourages combining ambition, hard work, self-improvement, and civic identity with talent to achieve and surpass goals, and to learn from the past without dwelling on mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

He acknowledges that hate speech can dissipate energy but finds solace in his father's maxim: "The measure of your success is the number of your enemies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. Haters often target successful individuals, whether young Olympians or business developers, out of envy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. He also notes that an increasing number of haters are bots used in political and ideological fights to spread hate and cause division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. Brzoska states that technology is advancing to track down anonymous haters, particularly those who harm the innocent or loved ones, leading to legal consequences that make them stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

A significant mathematical problem, open for 120 years, has been solved, contributing greatly to the understanding of [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This breakthrough, achieved by a Polish mathematician at the University of Cambridge (with the key insight occurring in Austria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, aims to bring humanity closer to understanding the [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | nature of the universe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Comprehending [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] is considered a "quantum leap" in understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Metrizable Problem

The problem, posed by French mathematician Roger Liouville at the end of the 19th century, is called the "metrizable problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. It asks whether it's possible to recreate a concept of distance from a given family of curves, such that these curves are the shortest paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. An everyday example is straight lines on a plane, where distance results from the Pythagorean theorem, and straight lines are the shortest paths between two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The inverse question is: can a concept of distance be recreated from the existence of straight lines? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>

The key idea for solving this problem occurred to the mathematician around 2007 or 2008 while on skis in Austria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Further work was done in Cambridge with colleagues Mikee from Australia and Robert Bry from Berkeley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Connection to [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's Theory of Relativity]]

The solution to the metrizable problem has profound implications for [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's theory of relativity]] and [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
According to [[general_relativity_and_singularities | Einstein's theory of gravity]], what is perceived as movement in a gravitational field (e.g., galaxies, planets, comets) is actually movement along "geodesic lines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. These are the shortest lines in a specific concept of "distance of space-time metrics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The "metric" (how to find this distance) is the unknown in [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

[[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's brilliant idea]] was to make this metric and the curvature of space-time dependent on matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The problem in the context of [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | relativity theory]] is: if we have the trajectory of all celestial bodies, can we recreate the metric—the entire space-time—from only these paths? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>

## [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | Black Holes]] and Singularities

The paths of objects falling into [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] are geodesics, but they disappear into regions of space-time from which they cannot escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Their paths are only known up to the moment of "singularity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The question then becomes: can the metric of the universe still be recreated from such incomplete geodesics? It turns out that usually, yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

In [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's theory]], the Pythagorean theorem is modified for space-time because it includes both spatial and time directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The metric is a formula or algorithm that describes how to consistently calculate distance in different points of space-time where curvature varies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Nature chooses paths where this distance is either minimal or maximal, the most "economical" way of moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

Typically, in classical [[general_relativity_and_singularities | Einstein's theory of gravity]], one starts with the metric and calculates trajectories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The solved problem reverses this: given all possible paths, can the metric be uncovered? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a> This is the physical application of a problem posed by a pure mathematician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### The Mysteries of [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | Black Holes]]
Understanding [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] is critical because our current understanding of physics "collapses" within them at the point of singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's theory of gravity]] predicts its own collapse within [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

Sir Roger Penrose, along with [[interplay_of_general_relativity_and_quantum_mechanics | Stephen Hawking]], showed that the existence of "singularities" is inevitable under physically reasonable mathematical assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. A singularity is a point or region in space-time where space-time curvature becomes infinitely large, or where geodesics (preferred curved lines) have a beginning but no end, terminating somewhere outside space-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>. This is where physics, as currently understood, ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>.

Penrose received the Nobel Prize in 2020 for explaining how the existence of [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] results from [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | the theory of relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. However, the work of Penrose and Hawking proves the existence of singularities (end points of space-time where physics ends), but not necessarily that these singularities must be hidden within [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] (regions from which nothing can escape) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:38">[01:28:38]</a>.

### The Cosmic Censor Hypothesis
The "cosmic censor hypothesis" proposes that all singularities must be hidden inside an event horizon, preventing observation of their nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20">[01:41:20]</a>. Whether this hypothesis is true—whether a horizon must always surround a singularity—remains an open problem in both physics and mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>. This involves solving complex nonlinear differential equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:06">[01:50:06]</a>. Many researchers have been working on this for over 50 years with moderate success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:50">[01:54:50]</a>.

### Hawking Radiation and the Information Paradox
A significant recent breakthrough in [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] research is the idea that what falls into a black hole might eventually come out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:53">[01:59:53]</a>. This challenges the classical view from [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's theory of relativity]] that nothing, not even light or information, can escape a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.

In the 1970s, [[interplay_of_general_relativity_and_quantum_mechanics | Stephen Hawking]] attempted to reconcile [[quantum_mechanics_and_relativity | quantum mechanics]] with [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | the theory of gravity]], despite the lack of a full [[relativity_and_quantum_gravity | quantum theory of gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:51">[01:54:51]</a>. He calculated what happens to quantum mechanical particles near a black hole's horizon, using the concept of "pair creation" (particle-antiparticle pairs created at high energies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:05">[01:57:05]</a>. His idea suggests that an antiparticle might fall into the black hole while its paired particle escapes to infinity, an effect known as "Hawking radiation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a>.

This implies that [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]], despite their immense mass, will eventually evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:03">[02:08:03]</a>. While the exact [[relativity_and_quantum_gravity | quantum theory of gravity]] is unknown, if it reduces to classical gravity at low energy levels and quantum mechanics laws are correct, then Hawking radiation should exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:23">[02:08:23]</a>.

A major unresolved question is the "information paradox": what happens to the information (energy, matter) that falls into a black hole during its evaporation? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:54">[02:18:54]</a> One view is that this information is destroyed forever; another is that some mechanism allows it to be obtained after evaporation via Hawking radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:09">[02:19:09]</a>.

### Empirical Evidence for [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | Black Holes]]
Scientific research on [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] is possible because the theory's predictions align with observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:25">[02:22:25]</a>. This is why Penrose had to wait almost 60 years for his Nobel Prize; while his theory was indisputable, direct evidence was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:25">[02:25:25]</a>.
In recent years, gravitational wave telescopes and the James Webb Space Telescope have provided direct and indirect evidence for the existence of [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:06">[02:34:06]</a>. Although [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] themselves cannot be observed directly because they are black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:51">[02:39:51]</a>, their gravitational influence on surrounding matter (e.g., spiral motion of nebulae, galaxies, intergalactic gas) can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:59">[02:49:59]</a>. This allows scientists to infer information about [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] by observing how they curve space-time and alter celestial body movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:39">[02:59:39]</a>.

## The Nature of Mathematics and its Role in Physics

Mathematics can define infinity as the limit of a sequence or series, or as the size of a set (e.g., infinitely many natural numbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. While mathematics can cope with infinity, physics and nature generally cannot; everything describable in physics uses finite (though possibly huge) numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Mathematics: Discovered or Created?
A core philosophical question is whether mathematics describes or creates reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:06">[02:48:06]</a>. The prevailing view among mathematicians is that they *discover* mathematics; it exists independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
Mathematics exists in its own world of abstract Platonic ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:20">[02:59:20]</a>. Mathematical truths (e.g., the Pythagorean theorem, the infinitude of prime numbers) would remain true even if humanity or the universe ceased to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:36">[02:59:36]</a>.
Mathematics is built upon axioms, fundamental rules that are not proven but assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Euclid, for instance, laid out the axioms of Euclidean geometry, and mathematicians then deduce truths from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. These deduced theorems exist regardless of human knowledge or desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:39">[03:37:39]</a>.

While mathematics is an exceptionally effective tool for physics, chemistry, and biology, mathematicians do not "create" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:03">[02:59:03]</a>. It's about discovering the inherent mathematical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:51">[03:00:51]</a>.

### The Relationship Between Physics and Mathematics
Physics cannot exist without mathematics, but mathematics could exist without physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. The laws of physics are described by mathematics, but mathematical laws exist irrespective of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:29">[03:01:29]</a>.
Since the time of Newton, it became clear that mathematics is the cognitive method for physics; to understand celestial body movement, one must solve equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:05">[03:02:05]</a>. Understanding physics often involves rewriting it as mathematical equations, solving them, and then interpreting the results back into physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:55">[03:02:55]</a>. There is a synergy between the two fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:08">[03:10:08]</a>.

### The Challenge of Unification
For almost 50 years, elementary particle physics has not advanced significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. While physicists have many ideas and breakthroughs, the connection between these discoveries and experiments is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:07">[03:57:07]</a>. The fundamental interactions (electromagnetic, strong, weak nuclear forces) are understood, but a [[relativity_and_quantum_gravity | quantum theory of gravity]] or "grand unification theory" that connects them all doesn't yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:29">[03:59:29]</a>.

One perspective is that the lack of progress stems from too much faith in [[quantum_mechanics_and_relativity | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Many physicists believe [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | gravity theory]] should be changed to a [[relativity_and_quantum_gravity | quantum theory of gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. However, the professor and [[interplay_of_general_relativity_and_quantum_mechanics | Roger Penrose]] suggest that [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | gravity theory]] should remain, and [[quantum_mechanics_and_relativity | quantum mechanics]] needs to be re-examined and modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

Their idea, developed over decades by Penrose, is that [[quantum_mechanics_and_relativity | quantum mechanics]] is not a complete theory, and the effects of [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | gravity]] should be taken into account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. Specifically, [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | gravity]] should modify the Schrödinger equation in [[quantum_mechanics_and_relativity | quantum theory]] such that the "wave function collapse" is a physical process that takes place over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. This collapse time would be inversely proportional to mass, explaining why massive objects seem to reduce immediately, while microscopic objects can remain in superposition for longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

This approach is controversial among scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, highlighting the difference between physics (which provokes speculation) and mathematics (where theorems, once proven, cannot be disputed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Their current work focuses on exploring this idea mathematically, potentially using "twistor theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

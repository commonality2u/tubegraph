Mathematics is often described as being full of beauty and elegance, a concept that can be difficult for non-mathematicians to grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Professor Dawid Kielak from Oxford University uses an analogy with Japanese Haiku poetry to explain this mathematical elegance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Haiku as an Analogy for Elegance

Haiku is a form of Japanese poetry distinguished by three key properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:
1.  **Conciseness:** Haiku is very concise, typically consisting of only three lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
2.  **Deep Content:** While brief, Haiku aims to inspire a deeper understanding of reality, often related to Japanese culture and Zen Buddhism, prompting reflection and meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
3.  **Aesthetic Beauty:** The connection between the concise form and the deep content must be beautiful and provide aesthetic pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This unique blend of brevity, profundity, and beauty is precisely the "elegance" found in [[independent_existence_of_mathematics | mathematics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Haiku in Science

Many fundamental scientific formulas can be considered "Haiku" due to their concise form, deep content, and inherent elegance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Examples include:
*   [[einstein_special_relativity_and_mathematical_visualization | Einstein's]] equation E=mc² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Schrödinger's equation, which describes particle evolution in quantum physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   Boltzmann's entropy principle, stating that entropy does not decrease (the second law of thermodynamics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   Another of [[einstein_special_relativity_and_mathematical_visualization | Einstein's]] equations, which describes the geometry of spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Euler's Formula: A Mathematical Haiku

Leonhard Euler, an outstanding and highly prolific Swiss mathematician from the 18th century, formulated what is perhaps the most elegant and beautiful formula in [[independent_existence_of_mathematics | mathematics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>:

$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>

This formula exemplifies the three features of a Haiku:
*   **Concise Form:** It is undoubtedly concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Deep Content:** It possesses profound content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Elegance:** The relationship between its concise form and deep content is highly elegant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Euler's formula is considered profoundly beautiful because it combines five fundamental constants of [[independent_existence_of_mathematics | mathematics]]: 0, 1, $\pi$ (Pi), $i$ (the imaginary unit), and $e$ (Euler's number) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. These three numbers ($e$, $\pi$, and $i$) originate from distinct areas of [[independent_existence_of_mathematics | mathematics]]—trigonometry, complex numbers, and mathematical analysis/differential calculus—yet they converge beautifully in this single formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Deconstructing Euler's Formula

Understanding the elegance of Euler's formula requires exploring its constituent parts, which can be thought of as "translating" from the "language of science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### 1. The Unit Circle and Trigonometry

A simpler "Haiku" in trigonometry is the identity: $\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This formula, derived from the Pythagorean theorem, describes the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. If the legs of a right triangle are $\cos x$ and $\sin x$, then the hypotenuse squared is $\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x$, which equals 1, meaning the hypotenuse has a length of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

The profound implication of this formula becomes clear with the introduction of the coordinate system by Descartes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. By placing one end of the hypotenuse at the origin (0,0), the other end must lie on a circle with a radius of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.The coordinates of any point on this unit circle are precisely $(\cos x, \sin x)$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This gives a full description, or parameterization, of the unit circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The variable $x$ in $\cos x$ and $\sin x$ represents the length of the arc along the unit circle from the positive x-axis to the point $(\cos x, \sin x)$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

The number $\pi$ is defined through this property: A quarter of the unit circle's circumference has a length of $\pi/2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Thus, the point at the top of the unit circle, with coordinates $(0,1)$, also has coordinates $(\cos(\pi/2), \sin(\pi/2))$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Extending this, a half-circle traversal leads to the point $(-1,0)$, corresponding to $(\cos \pi, \sin \pi)$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### 2. Complex Numbers

The coordinate system opened up new possibilities, such as adding points on a plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. While the Greeks believed this was impossible, Descartes' system allows for it by simply adding corresponding coordinates: $(a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d)$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

To facilitate multiplication of points, a new notation is introduced where $(a,b)$ is written as $a + ib$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. When multiplying $(a+ib)(c+id)$, a term $i^2$ appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. To make multiplication meaningful and ensure the result is still a point on the plane (i.e., in the form of $X + iY$), mathematicians defined $i^2 = -1$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This introduced the "imaginary unit" $i$, leading to the concept of complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

With this new notation, the point on the unit circle corresponding to $\pi$ can be written as $\cos \pi + i \sin \pi = -1 + i \cdot 0 = -1$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

### 3. The Exponential Function ($e^x$)

Understanding the meaning of raising a number to an arbitrary power (like $\pi$ or a square root) requires defining the exponential function, $e^x$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. A key property of $e^x$ is that its derivative is equal to itself ($d/dx(e^x) = e^x$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

This function can be represented as an infinite sum (a Taylor series) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>:
$e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \dots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
Taking the derivative of this series indeed reproduces the original series, confirming its unique property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

Similarly, sine and cosine functions also have their own infinite series representations, which can be derived from their derivative properties ($d/dx(\sin x) = \cos x$ and $d/dx(\cos x) = -\sin x$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>:
$\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \dots$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>
$\cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \dots$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>

### 4. Connecting the Pieces: Euler's Identity

Euler's genius was in recognizing the similarity between the series for $e^x$ and those for $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. The alternating signs in the sine and cosine series, and the presence of only odd or even terms, are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. By substituting $ix$ into the series for $e^x$, and leveraging the property $i^2 = -1$:
$e^{ix} = 1 + ix + \frac{(ix)^2}{2!} + \frac{(ix)^3}{3!} + \frac{(ix)^4}{4!} + \dots$
$e^{ix} = 1 + ix - \frac{x^2}{2!} - i\frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + i\frac{x^5}{5!} + \dots$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>
Separating the real and imaginary terms:
$e^{ix} = \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \dots\right) + i\left(x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \dots\right)$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>

This reveals Euler's formula: $e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

To arrive at the final elegant identity, substitute $x = \pi$:
$e^{i\pi} = \cos \pi + i \sin \pi$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>
Since $\cos \pi = -1$ and $\sin \pi = 0$:
$e^{i\pi} = -1 + i \cdot 0$
$e^{i\pi} = -1$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>

Rearranging gives the celebrated Euler's Identity: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. This formula beautifully unifies five fundamental mathematical constants from different domains, demonstrating the profound interconnectedness and inherent elegance within [[independent_existence_of_mathematics | mathematics]].

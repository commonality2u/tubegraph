The understanding of the physical world is deeply intertwined with mathematics, which is seen as existing independently of human discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The more the physical world's workings are understood, the more its dependence on mathematics becomes apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Mathematical Concepts and Reality
Mathematical concepts are considered objective realities that exist independently of human creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. It is like archaeology, where one digs to discover results that were always there, even if previously unseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. These results are objective and would persist even without humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Mathematical truth, while its comprehension can be subjective, is not itself subjective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

There are three realities: mathematical concepts, the physical world, and the mental world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The laws of physics appear to be regulated by mathematics, a mathematics with a universal and inherent beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Visualization in Mathematics and Physics
Mathematicians are often divided between those who prefer visual images and those who favor a more abstract or algebraic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. While some eminent mathematicians like Michael Atiyah acknowledge both types of thinking, visual understanding is often more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

The speaker expresses a preference for visual thinking, describing mathematical thought as a very visual process for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Brain's Role in Understanding
The human brain's three-dimensionality does not limit the understanding of higher dimensions in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Mathematics applied in [[Quantum Mechanics and Relativity | quantum mechanics]] deals with schemes that are not three- or four-dimensional, but can be n-dimensional or even infinite-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. While higher dimensions may be more difficult to visualize, thinking can occur in a non-visual way, and visual thinking can sometimes be limiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

The speaker notes that their visual approach to mathematics was a minority among their university peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

### Systemic Bias Against Geometric Thinking
There is a perceived systemic prejudice against mathematicians who excel at [[Geometry and spacetime | geometric thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Exams for geometric thinkers are considered harder than for those with non-geometric thinking, as they often require translating visual understanding into written, verbal forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. This can disadvantage visual thinkers who might be slower at writing or translating their thoughts compared to those who think in a more direct, verbal way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## Einstein, Minkowski, and Relativity
[[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Special relativity]] did not solely depend on Einstein for its discovery; many ideas, including those from Lorentz and particularly Minkowski, existed before him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. While Einstein integrated these ideas into a general picture and developed key aspects like E=mcÂ², he was initially conservative regarding special relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

Minkowski described [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | special relativity]] in a [[Geometry and spacetime | four-dimensional geometric way]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Einstein initially dismissed Minkowski's [[Geometry and spacetime | geometric interpretation]] of [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | special relativity]] as "mathematical smart talk" or "sophistry," not real physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. However, to develop [[General relativity and singularities | general relativity]], Einstein realized he needed Minkowski's [[Geometry and spacetime | four-dimensional]] depiction of spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. This flat, multidimensional space visualization was crucial for the development of [[General relativity and singularities | general relativity]] by allowing the concept of curving this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

The name "relativity" itself can be misleading, suggesting a dependence on coordinates or relative viewpoints rather than an absolute geometric object being described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. The speaker suggests that Einstein had difficulties with and did not intuitively grasp certain mathematical concepts, making him better at physics than mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

## Spacetime Visualization
Thinking in [[Geometry and spacetime | four-dimensional spacetime]] for [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | special relativity]] is now much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. While individuals might use tricks, such as imagining a [[Geometry and spacetime | four-dimensional]] image in a three-dimensional way, this can be imprecise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. When considering [[General relativity and singularities | general relativity]] or [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | special relativity]], one must differentiate between spatial dimensions and the time dimension, which behaves differently (e.g., a minus sign algebraically) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Despite the challenge of visualizing four dimensions, it is possible through conceptual understanding, even if the brain's three-dimensionality might make it more difficult for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

## Romanticism in Mathematics and Physics
Mathematics can be seen as romantic because it describes the real world while offering a fantastical, almost fairy-tale-like experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. Short stories, such as those by George Gamow, like "Mr. Tompkins," explain physics by imagining scenarios where physical parameters (e.g., speed of light) are different, making complex theories like [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | special relativity]] relatable and understandable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. These stories present romantic plots by exploring "what if" scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

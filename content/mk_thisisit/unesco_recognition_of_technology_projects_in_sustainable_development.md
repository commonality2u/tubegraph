The International Institute for Research on Artificial Intelligence (under the auspices of UNESCO) annually distinguishes global projects that significantly contribute to the implementation of the [[UN Sustainable Development Goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:06">[07:10:06]</a>. These goals, numbering 17, include targets such as the [[biodiversity_preservation_with_technology | preservation of biodiversity]] and the protection of life on land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. Projects are selected for their positive [[technological_advancements_and_societal_impact | impact on nature conservation]] and sustainable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:24">[06:51:24]</a>.

## The Empaza Application

A notable example of a project receiving this distinction is the *Empaza* application, developed by Poles at Apsilon in cooperation with scientists from the University of Stirling and national parks in Gabon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. *Empaza* was recognized among the top 10 applications globally by UNESCO, formally termed "outstanding" among the top 100 projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

### Purpose and Functionality
*Empaza* was created to help save endangered species, particularly in the forests of Central Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. The application utilizes modern technologies, such as machine vision and machine learning algorithms, to analyze images from camera traps placed deep within tropical forests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. These algorithms are trained to recognize various species present in the photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

Camera traps, small devices the size of a palm, contain a camera, heat sensor, and motion sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. When an animal, like an African forest elephant, passes by, a photo is taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Ecologists and forest guards embark on expeditions, often lasting 3-4 weeks, to place and later collect these camera traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. The collected data, typically around 30,000 photos per expedition, are saved on SD cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

Traditionally, reviewing these photos manually took two to three weeks for a single expedition, as it is a tiring task requiring high attention to detail amidst dense forest imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. *Empaza* significantly reduces this time; it can process 30,000 photos in about 8 hours (one day) while running completely offline on a laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. The accuracy of the models is comparable to human assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.

### Impact on Conservation
The rapid analysis provided by *Empaza* allows scientists to quickly extract critical information, such as which camera trap photographed which animal and when <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. This data can be mapped geographically to understand animal movements and assess changes in migration patterns, particularly those influenced by climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

Beyond migration studies, *Empaza* supports:
*   Informing decisions on infrastructure development, helping avoid building roads in animal migration routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   Identifying gorillas in photos to assess their health status and track the spread of diseases within their communities, enabling faster intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

### Accessibility and Funding
*Empaza* is an [[open_source_applications_for_environmental_conservation | open-source application]], with its full source code and machine learning models available on GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This [[open_source_applications_for_environmental_conservation | open-source]] approach aims to maximize the positive [[impact_of_technology_on_human_society | impact on nature conservation]] by allowing as many scientists and national park guards as possible to use and develop the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

The project was largely developed Pro Bono (pro-social), with some limited funding from non-governmental and governmental institutions over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. It is primarily used in national parks in Gabon, Cameroon, Kenya, and has recently been tested in Congo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

## Broader Role of AI in Sustainable Development
Artificial intelligence plays a crucial [[impact_of_technology_on_human_society | role in sustainable development]] beyond business applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. The UNESCO list of 100 projects highlights how machine learning can aid various sustainable development goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

Other examples of AI's application in environmental conservation include:
*   A project in cooperation with the Arctowski station in Antarctica, where AI detects animals from drone images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>.
*   Research at the North Pole helping to build models that accelerate the large-scale study of plankton, which is vital for ocean ecosystems and climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.

These initiatives demonstrate how AI can process vast amounts of data quickly, providing insights crucial for ecologists and other scientists working to understand and protect the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.

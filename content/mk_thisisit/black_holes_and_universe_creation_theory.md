The theory that [[black_holes_and_universe_creation | black holes create new universes]] is a concept explored by theoretical physicist Nikodem Popławski, who believes our universe may exist on the other side of an event horizon of a black hole that created it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This idea suggests that the only "exit" from our universe is through the black hole that formed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Nikodem Popławski's Concept

Popławski's concept proposes that [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black holes]], instead of leading to a singularity (a point of infinite density), create an "Einstein-Rosen bridge," often referred to as a "wormhole," to a new universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[21:26]</a>. This theory was recognized by National Geographic and *Science* magazine as one of the most important scientific concepts of its year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[42:28]</a>. Morgan Freeman even called Popławski the "second Copernicus," and a scientific search engine, Zaro/Sepro, identified him as [[Albert Einstein | Einstein's]] successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[04:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[10:09]</a>.

### The Problem with Singularity

The standard general theory of relativity predicts that matter inside a black hole collapses into a singularity, a point where matter density and space-time curvature become infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[02:26]</a>. Popławski argues that infinite quantities are not physically measurable, indicating that the theory is incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[02:40]</a>.

Instead, Popławski suggests that matter collapses to a state of very high density, then stops and begins to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[03:13]</a>. This matter cannot return past the black hole's event horizon because movement through it is one-way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[03:37]</a>. Since space-time inside a black hole is not static, matter has no choice but to expand into a new space, interpreted as a new expanding universe on the other side of the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[03:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[04:05]</a>.

### Our Universe as a Black Hole's Interior

Popławski posits that our universe is "on the other side" of the event horizon of the black hole that created it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[07:11]</a>. He uses an analogy of a door: the black hole is a door that leads not to a closet (as in the standard theory where the interior is limited), but to a much larger, new space, like "the outside of the house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[07:34]</a>.

If our universe was created inside a black hole, it had to be born inside a black hole that existed in an earlier "parent universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

### The Role of Space-time Twisting (Torsion)

A key mechanism in Popławski's model is the "twisting of space-time," or torsion, which he has studied for 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. This concept comes from [[Einstein's]]-Kartan theory of gravity, a generalization of general relativity from 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. Thanks to this torsion, singularities do not exist inside black holes; instead, matter "bounces" non-singularly, meaning without infinities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.

Since there are no infinities, the laws of physics do not "reset" inside the new universe, implying that a new universe created from a black hole would have the same laws of physics and constants as its parent universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

## Predictions and Observational Evidence

### Closed Universe
If our cosmos is discovered to be a [[the_expansion_of_the_universe_and_the_big_bang_theory | closed universe]], it would strongly support the theory that a black hole created it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. In a three-dimensional closed universe, moving in any direction would eventually lead back to the starting point from the opposite direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. However, due to the [[the_expansion_of_the_universe_and_the_big_bang_theory | expansion of the universe]], it's currently impossible to "go around" the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Merging Universes
If two black holes orbit each other and merge into one, and each black hole creates a new universe, then the two universes inside these black holes would also merge into one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. From an observer's perspective, this merger could cause the universe to suddenly lose its spherical symmetry, displaying a "distinguished direction" where the second universe merges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. Some astronomers have observed an apparent distinguished direction in our cosmos, where superclusters of galaxies seem to move differently in various directions, which could be consistent with this idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

### White Holes
From the perspective of those within a newly created universe, the black hole that formed it would appear as a "white hole" – an object from which matter can only emerge, not enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. The discovery of a single white hole in our universe would confirm Popławski's theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

### Inflationary Expansion
Popławski's model suggests that the expansion of the universe just after the "Big Bounce" (when matter expands instead of forming a singularity) naturally resembles cosmic inflation, the exponential expansion of the early universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>. By combining space-time torsion with quantum production of particle-antiparticle pairs at high densities, his model naturally creates a short-lived inflation without needing hypothetical scalar fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>.

## Related Concepts and Debates

### Multiverse
If every black hole creates a new universe, this naturally leads to a [[Cyclic Universe Theory | multiverse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. However, Popławski's multiverse differs from the "many-worlds interpretation" in quantum mechanics: in his model, an observer can only exist in one universe at a time, and travel between universes requires finding and entering a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

### Laws of Physics in Other Universes
The physicist Lee Smolin also proposed that [[black_holes_and_universe_creation | black holes create new universes]], but in his model, the laws of physics could reset at the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. Smolin's concept includes "cosmological selection," where universes with laws that produce more black holes would propagate, similar to natural selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. In contrast, Popławski's model, due to the absence of singularities, maintains the same laws of physics and constants across the parent and child universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

### Antimatter Problem
One of the biggest problems in cosmology is the scarcity of antimatter in our universe, given that the standard model predicts equal amounts of matter and antimatter should have been created in the [[the_expansion_of_the_universe_and_the_big_bang_theory | Big Bang]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. It's theorized that a slight asymmetry caused matter to dominate, leading to the annihilation of antimatter into photons, leaving behind the matter we observe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### The Nature of Time
The general theory of relativity predicts that gravity curves not only space but also time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. Time slows down in stronger gravitational fields, as famously depicted in *Interstellar* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. At the event horizon of a black hole, time appears to "freeze" to zero for an outside observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. However, for an observer falling into the black hole, the passage through the event horizon occurs in a finite "proper time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

Some theories suggest that on the other side of an event horizon, time could cease to exist, becoming a fourth spatial dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. Stephen Hawking even proposed this to solve the "what was before the Big Bang" problem, arguing that if time didn't exist, the question becomes meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>. Alternatively, others suggest that time switches roles with a spatial dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. Popławski, however, believes that time is not an illusion, as [[Einstein's]] general theory of relativity, which assumes time as a fourth dimension, correctly explains fundamental physical phenomena like light bending around massive objects and Mercury's orbital precession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>.

### Quantum Gravity and Gravitons
Popławski believes that space-time is fundamentally classical and curved, without the need for gravitons as carriers of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>. He suggests that matter is quantized and interacts via quantum forces (weak, strong, electromagnetism) within this curved classical space-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. This contrasts with some quantum gravity theories that propose gravitons acting on a flat space-time, making it effectively curved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.

## Implications for Travel
Travel between universes is theorized to be possible but only in one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. If one enters a black hole, they would leave their current universe and enter a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. Supermassive black holes, like Sagittarius A* at the center of our galaxy, are relatively safe to cross the event horizon due to weaker tidal forces compared to smaller ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. An observer falling into a large black hole would not immediately be torn apart and could still observe distorted parts of the original universe and objects falling after them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. However, it is uncertain if the new universe would be immediately hospitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:5:02">[05:02]</a>.

## Development and Recognition
Popławski's journey to this theory began when he wrote an article in 2010 describing how particles enter a black hole, including a delicate conclusion that every [[black_holes_and_universe_creation | black hole creates a new universe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. This conclusion, logically derived from his mathematical work, garnered significant attention from publications like National Geographic and *Science* News, leading to further research and media appearances, including on Morgan Freeman's *Curiosity* series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>. His work aimed to provide a mechanism—space-time torsion—that removes singularities and enables new universe creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

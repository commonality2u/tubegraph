Professor Karol Myśliwiec, an esteemed Egyptologist and member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, considers his work in the Nile Delta to be among his most significant scientific experiences. Over half a century of archaeological work in Egypt, Myśliwiec has made discoveries that have reshaped understanding of [[Ancient Egypt and Ptolemaic period discoveries | Ancient Egypt and Ptolemaic period discoveries]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

## Revelations at Tell Atrib

Professor Myśliwiec's most exceptional scientific experience occurred when he realized they were uncovering a city from the Ptolemaic period (the last three centuries BC) in Tell Atrib, located 50 km north of Cairo. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> The initial discovery involved finding city remains at a depth of merely 5 cm. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> Further [[Excavation methodologies and challenges | excavation methodologies and challenges]] revealed additional layers extending 300 years earlier. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>

A key aspect of these findings was the precise separation of layers, allowing for highly accurate [[Dating methods for ancient traces | dating methods for ancient traces]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> This precision was achieved through the analysis of numerous well-preserved coins and ceramic amphora stamps, some datable with an accuracy of one year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> Consequently, monuments previously dated with accuracies of 500 to 1000 years could now be precisely dated to within 50 years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> This level of scientific advancement in the Nile Delta was unprecedented. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>

### Impact on Egyptology

The Tell Atrib [[Ancient Egypt and Ptolemaic period discoveries | discoveries]] profoundly impacted the scientific world:
*   The excavations provided entirely new insights into Egypt during the period from Alexander the Great to Cleopatra VII. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>
*   International experts recognized the significance of these findings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
*   A lecture given by Professor Myśliwiec in Britain led to museums altering exhibition signatures for certain monuments, revising their dates by as much as 500 years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
*   Similarly, Professor Franco, a leading scholar of Greco-Roman terracottas, had to reconsider her published three-volume work, as Myśliwiec's findings indicated many figurines previously categorized as Roman were in fact 500 years older. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>
*   These excavations were described as "shocking the scientific world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>

## Archaeological Methods and Humility

Professor Myśliwiec emphasizes that [[Archaeological practices and ethics in Egypt | archaeological practices and ethics in Egypt]] require humility. He states that an archaeologist cannot definitively predict what they will find; instead, the ambition lies in accurately describing and interpreting discoveries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a> He expresses little respect for archaeologists who make premature predictions and later complain when their expectations are not met. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>

The choice of [[Excavation methodologies and challenges | excavation methodologies and challenges]] depends on various factors such as the site's location, the historical period of interest, and the state of preservation of monuments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a> Discoveries may necessitate immediate conservation, potentially altering initial excavation plans. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>

### Challenges in the Nile Delta
Excavations in the Nile Delta present unique difficulties due to:
*   **Subsurface water:** Water levels can be significantly high, especially at certain times of the year, requiring constant pumping during operations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>
*   **Agricultural land:** If a site is located in cultivated fields, archaeologists must negotiate land use with owners, potentially buying the land for survey and subsequent excavation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>

Despite these challenges, archaeologists must possess flexible thinking and react immediately to new discoveries, adapting their methods accordingly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>

## Ongoing Mysteries and Future Discoveries

Professor Myśliwiec believes that [[Ancient Egypt and Ptolemaic period discoveries | various mysteries]] are uncovered by Egyptologists almost daily. For him, two significant mysteries related to the Step Pyramid of Djoser continue to await answers: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:25">[02:42:25]</a>
*   **The tomb of Imhotep:** The creator of the world's oldest pyramid, the priest Imhotep, is believed to be buried somewhere near the pyramid, but his tomb has not yet been definitively located or confirmed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:47">[02:47:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:52">[02:54:52]</a>
*   **The initial burial place of Alexander the Great in Egypt:** It is thought that Alexander's mummy was provisionally housed in Saqqara, near the Djoser pyramid, before being transferred to Alexandria. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:56">[02:51:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:10">[02:53:10]</a> Myśliwiec suggests that an ancient Ptolemaic shrine, the "Tolemaic chemise," near the pyramid could indicate the temporary presence of Alexander's mummy nearby. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:05">[02:57:05]</a> He believes that the tomb, if found, may not contain grand artifacts, as these likely moved with the body to Alexandria, but could feature inscriptions confirming its temporary use. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:39">[02:58:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>

Myśliwiec notes that in Egypt, when one mystery is solved, ten more often emerge. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a> He remains optimistic that [[Polish contributions to Egyptology | Polish contributions to Egyptology]] could lead to these significant [[Ancient Egypt and Ptolemaic period discoveries | discoveries]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:31">[02:59:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:36">[02:59:36]</a>

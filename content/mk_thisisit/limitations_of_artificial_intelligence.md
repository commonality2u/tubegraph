The term "artificial intelligence" (AI) is considered a misnomer, as genuine intelligence requires consciousness, which current AI systems lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Computers are fundamentally a special type of mathematical structure based on computational mathematics, a very limited part of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Consciousness is believed not to be computational, meaning computers will likely never gain consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Misconception of Intelligence
Current AI, when discussed, does not "know" what it is doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The immense power of computers has led people to lose sight of their true nature and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, leading to a "loss of the heart of the matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. A more appropriate term for what is currently known as AI might be "artificial cleverness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Students, for instance, can be clever and repeat what they've learned without truly understanding it, much like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

### Consciousness and Computability
A central argument against AI possessing consciousness is the concept of computability, derived from mathematical logic. Studies in mathematical logic, including Turing machines and Gödel's theorem, indicate that there are things whose understanding goes beyond their use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

*   **Gödel's Theorem**: This theorem suggests that a statement can be constructed whose meaning is understood, but which cannot be proven based on accepted computational principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The ingenuity lies in being able to input the rules for proof into a computer, which means these are computational principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, there are aspects of mathematics that are "uncomputable" and cannot be entered into a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Understanding vs. Calculation**: AI cannot create its own rules because it does not "know" if they are true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The ability to go beyond rules comes from understanding why they are true, which requires awareness and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Consciousness allows for the transcendence of rules by seeing why they are true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. AI, however, simply performs calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, without understanding its operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## AI as a Computational Tool
AI's role is primarily associated with computational power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Computers are now so powerful that they can perform tasks far beyond human capabilities, such as analyzing vast amounts of data and identifying patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Yet, AI operates as a "simple statistical machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, a "black box" where inputs and outputs are known, but the internal "understanding" is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

AI relies on algorithms and is inherently computational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Mathematics, as an abstract subject, extends far beyond computability, with parts that cannot be calculated using algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Consciousness is believed to be connected to a type of physics that is "uncomputable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, going beyond the computable quantum world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

## Future Implications and Risks
While AI can be better than humans at many tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, such as driving autonomous vehicles by processing vast data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>, this does not indicate consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. The greatest risk in the [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | development of artificial intelligence]] is people believing that machines are truly conscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. If machines were actually conscious, the risk would be even greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

Current AI, being based on computers, inherently excludes consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Even the development of universal quantum computers might not lead to synthetic consciousness, as the quantum world itself is considered fundamentally incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a> and its reality is different from classical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Quantum reality is "uncomputable" and behaves peculiarly, including aspects of backward causality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. Until how the quantum world works is fully understood, it cannot be transferred to digital space for consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

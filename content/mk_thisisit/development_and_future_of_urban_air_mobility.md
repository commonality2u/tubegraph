Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an evolving concept aimed at transforming transportation within and around cities using advanced air vehicles. A key innovation in this field is the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]], a single-person ultra-light personal [[potential_applications_and_future_development_of_flying_vehicles | flying vehicle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The creators envision the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] becoming the "Tesla of [[potential_applications_and_future_development_of_flying_vehicles | flying vehicles]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] Personal Flying Vehicle

The [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] is described as the world's first ultra-fast personal flying vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, often referred to as a "flying car" despite lacking wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. It is explicitly not an unmanned drone, as it is designed for a single occupant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Design and Specifications
The main assumptions for the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]]'s design were simplicity, compactness, and ultra-light weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Weight**: The vehicle weighs only 40 kg without batteries and about 90 kg with batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Speed**: It can reach a maximum speed of 100 km/h, which is regulated for ultra-light vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Flight Time & Range**: The flight time is approximately 20 minutes, allowing a straight-line flight of about 30 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Control**: Flying the device is intuitive, with an on-board computer making control very simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Training takes only a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Take-off and Landing**: It is an electric vehicle with vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) capabilities, able to take off stably from a space of 5 square meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Safety Features
Safety is a primary concern for the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Structure**: The vehicle features a whole frame, a safety cage inspired by racing cars, and a four-point seatbelt system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
*   **Systems**: It has a triple-cloned on-board computer system, meaning three identical systems control the flight for redundancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.
*   **Propulsion**: With eight propellers and eight engines, the vehicle can continue to fly even if one, or in some cases two, engines are lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.
*   **Automation**: A large layer of software allows the vehicle to hover autonomously, regardless of wind conditions, and prevents pilot error through sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
*   **Emergency**: A ballistic parachute system will be installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>.

## Key Milestones and Regulations

The development of the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] has involved significant regulatory and certification milestones, particularly in Italy and the United States.

### Certification and Pilot Training
The most recent milestone is the certification in Italy, the first of its kind in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This certification enables ultra-light [[potential_applications_and_future_development_of_flying_vehicles | flying vehicles]] like the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] to fly in uncontrolled airspace (outside airports and large cities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Pilots can now move in Italy after short training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

The company plans to establish the world's first school for pilots of [[potential_applications_and_future_development_of_flying_vehicles | flying vehicles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. Unlike traditional pilot licenses (PPL), which can take a year and significant cost, [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] training is expected to be two or three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Remote-Controlled Flights
Another significant development is the ability to perform remote-controlled flights, which allows for testing and development without unnecessary risk to a human test pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This capability greatly aids in setting flight parameters and developing next versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### International Regulations
In the United States, the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] generally does not require any pilot license to fly under Part 103 ultralight regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Poland also uses similar regulations, theoretically allowing [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] flights after training under the UL 115 class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Europe, however, has been more challenging, but the recent Italian certification is a vital first step towards wider European adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Vision and Market Impact

The primary application for the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] is recreational fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. However, other interesting applications are being explored:
*   Rescue services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>

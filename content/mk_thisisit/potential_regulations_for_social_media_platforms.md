Journalist Max Fisher, who investigated how [[role_of_social_media_algorithms_in_political_polarization | social media algorithms]] affect global events, highlights a growing consensus that regulation is needed for social media platforms, especially concerning their impact on violence and political polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

## Perceived Harms of Social Media

Fisher argues that social media can indirectly lead to death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:26">[01:54:26]</a>. While the effect on an individual may seem small, its operation on a scale of billions of people daily can move politics in "dangerously divisive or hateful" directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:52">[02:31:52]</a>. Examples include genocide in Myanmar, violence in Sri Lanka, and communal violence in India, where significant numbers of people died due to racist or other violence triggered on these platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>. Some platforms have even admitted to their role in extreme cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:42">[03:01:42]</a>.

Companies like Facebook had evidence from their own researchers repeatedly warning that their platforms trigger behaviors with real-world impact, leading to violence and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:15">[03:42:15]</a>. Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, knew about these warnings, including specific cases predicting thousands of deaths, yet took no action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:31">[06:01:31]</a>. While this doesn't make him a murderer, it makes the companies [[responsibility_of_social_media_companies | responsible for the deaths]] they "didn't save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:28">[06:13:28]</a>.

The core issue lies with algorithms designed to maximize user time on platforms for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. Human nature dictates that what is most stimulating, leading to more time spent, includes fear of others, "us vs. them" narratives, conspiracy theories, hate, and collective outrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:04">[05:28:04]</a>. This means platforms, through their algorithms, inadvertently promote content that leads to racist hatred and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:30">[05:51:30]</a>.

## Existing and Proposed Regulations

Europe has already introduced regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), focusing on data processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:24">[08:08:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:43">[21:05:43]</a>. The European Union is also working on [[potential_threats_and_regulation_of_AI | regulations regarding artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:48">[21:10:48]</a>. In contrast, there is currently no specific regulation on social media in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:14">[21:14:14]</a>.

### The Debate on Regulation Focus: Content vs. Design

There's a growing consensus that existing regulations, which often focus on content moderation, are regulating the "wrong area of the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:33:04">[21:33:04]</a>. Content moderation laws, like Germany's, restrict certain types of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:48">[21:40:48]</a>. However, the problem is that platforms are designed to artificially promote divisive and hateful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a>.

The emerging belief is that the only effective way to regulate is to introduce laws that address the "design of the systems themselves" and specifically affect algorithms and content promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:26">[22:08:26]</a>. This approach would target the root cause of the problem rather than just trying to manage the symptoms.

### AI and Content Creation

The Writers Guild of America, a writers' union in Los Angeles, went on strike with one of their main demands being the introduction of rules prohibiting the [[regulation_and_control_of_ai_technologies | use of artificial intelligence]] in creating any content for television programs or movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:53:14">[26:53:14]</a>. Studios oppose this, arguing that AI currently cannot replace human creativity in scriptwriting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:00">[27:09:00]</a>.

While AI is good at processing existing text and large amounts of information, it is not yet capable of original creation; it can only copy and process existing ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:04">[27:42:04]</a>. However, it's plausible that in the future, media could use AI to generate raw article drafts, with humans then refining them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:58">[28:06:58]</a>.

A revolutionary discovery of prehuman traces was made in Crete by Dr. Gerard Gelinski of the State Geological Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This finding, located in Trachilos, Crete, challenges the long-held theory of human origins solely in Africa, suggesting human evolution may have begun in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

## The Discovery and Its Age

Dr. Gelinski first observed the surface with traces in 2002 while on vacation, initially unable to identify them despite years of studying dinosaur traces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. In 2008, he realized the tracks were human, a revelation he found somewhat paradoxical and embarrassing as a tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

Initial geological maps suggested the tracks dated to the end of the Miocene, approximately 5 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. However, more precise [[dating_methods_for_ancient_traces | research]] from a few years ago indicates the tracks are **6.02 million years old** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. While the discovery was made earlier, the world learned about it in 2017 when the findings were published, after years of rigorous verification by a team of skeptical specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of the Tracks and Perpetrator

The tracks are described as reduced human tracks, similar to a child's, measuring about 10 to 14 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:38:00">[24:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>. They show clear evidence of bipedalism, with the big toe adducted to the other toes, unlike the abducted thumb found in apes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:00">[24:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>. While the toes appear human, the heel and overall foot structure initially resembled a simian foot, though later comparison with a baby's foot showed similar heel characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:00">[25:24:00]</a>.

Early hominins like *Australopithecus* and *Sahelanthropus* (if considered a hominin) were about a meter tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. Professor Madelaine Böhme from the University of Tübingen suggests the tracks' perpetrator was *Graecopithecus*, whose remains were found in Bulgaria and Greece. Her team posits *Graecopithecus* as the oldest hominin on Earth, from which the human evolutionary line originated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

There are approximately 60 tracks and a dozen trails found at the Trachilos site, with two trails running parallel, suggesting a family group or individuals walking together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:39:00">[25:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:42:00">[25:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:00">[25:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:14:00">[26:14:00]</a>. Additional tracks were found on an analogous surface extending into the Mediterranean Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>.

## [[Impact_on_the_theory_of_human_evolution | Impact on the Theory of Human Evolution]]

The discovery in Crete challenges the traditional "Out of Africa" theory, which posits human origins solely in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. If Professor Bau's theory about *Graecopithecus* is correct, it means hominin evolution could have truly begun in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.

The tracks also reinforce the [[role_of_bipedalism_in_human_evolution | role of bipedalism in human evolution]] as a fundamental evolutionary step. It suggests that the beginning of humanity was marked by the adaptation of legs and an upright posture, not primarily by an increase in brain size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>. The development of the brain is considered a side effect of bipedalism and adaptation to new challenges in a new environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

This discovery introduces the possibility of "convergence" – that humans (or similar bipedal hominins) may have arisen twice, independently, in different regions: once in Europe around 6 million years ago (Crete) and again in Africa around 3.5 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. This idea is debated, as some arguments deny such convergence for complex features like feathers or hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

The Crete findings contradict the [[dating_methods_for_ancient_traces | genetic clock]] of human lice, which suggests human ancestors lost hair and descended from trees no earlier than 3 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. This is further supported by the older Laetoli tracks of *Australopithecus* in Tanzania, which clearly demonstrate definite bipedality and are older than the separation indicated by lice genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.

## Environment and Lifestyle

The region of Crete where the tracks were found was influenced by the Messinian salinity crisis, a period when the Mediterranean Sea nearly dried up, and the climate became rapidly drier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>. Forests transformed into steppe or park forests, forcing species to adapt, migrate, or face extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. This environmental change occurred about 3 million years earlier than similar shifts in East Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.

The area was a coastal environment resembling the African savanna, inhabited by fauna similar to modern African savanna animals, including elephants, hyenas, and buffaloes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>. The presence of marine plankton (foraminifera) in the sediment confirms a coastal setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.

It is hypothesized that these early hominins, like later *Homo erectus*, followed coastal areas, possibly feeding on easily available high-energy foods such as fruits, clams, snails, and crabs that washed up on the beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>. This represents a drastic change in diet and behavior from forest-dwelling ancestors, potentially involving hunting or scavenging meat from large savanna predators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:29:00">[33:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:35:00">[33:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:00">[33:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:45:00">[33:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:53:00">[33:53:00]</a>.

## [[Excavation_methodologies_and_challenges | Preservation of Traces]]

For such traces to be preserved for millions of years, they must be quickly covered by another sediment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. The original sand turns into hard rock, like sandstone, effectively fixing the footprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

> [!info] Fossilization of Footprints
> While individual footprints on a beach disappear quickly due to waves or rain, over geological timescales, many traces are preserved. A single skeleton is unlikely to be preserved in fossil material due to oxygenated burial environments. In contrast, footprints are often rapidly covered by sediment layers, allowing them to solidify and be preserved for millions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:00">[27:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:32:00">[27:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:34:00">[27:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:38:00">[27:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03:00">[28:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:15:00">[28:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[29:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>.

## Site Management and Other Discoveries

The Trachilos site in Crete is secured, featuring an information board and a cast of the traces, with an additional cast in the museum in Kisamos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:35:00">[26:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:42:00">[26:42:00]</a>. An incident involving an attempt to chip off a piece of the site by a local teacher highlights the importance of [[archaeological_practices_and_ethics_in_egypt | site security and ethics]], which was swiftly handled by the Greek police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14:00">[27:14:00]</a>.

Other significant trace fossil discoveries in the region include:
*   **Malaga, Spain**: Tracks found approximately 40 km north of Malaga, a few million years younger than those in Crete (over 5 million years old), also indicate hominin presence. These traces show a "regressed" feature, appearing halfway between a gorilla and a human foot, suggesting a more primitive stage of foot adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.
*   **Crete (Balos Lagoon and other areas)**: Further hominin tracks have been found underwater at the Trachilos site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>. Additionally, the Roka Formation, which preserved the hominin traces, is exposed kilometers away to the south of Trachilos, containing well-preserved tracks of hyenas and elephants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:23:00">[32:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:28:00">[32:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:08:00">[33:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:11:00">[33:11:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The discovery of prehuman tracks in Crete is a significant paleontological find that challenges long-standing theories about human origins. It highlights the importance of [[excavation_methodologies_and_challenges | trace fossils]] in understanding early hominin behavior and evolution, particularly [[role_of_bipedalism_in_human_evolution | bipedalism]]. The persistence of modern humans in conquering new environments and taking risks, beginning millions of years ago, reflects a deep-seated drive that continues today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:25:00">[34:25:00]</a>.

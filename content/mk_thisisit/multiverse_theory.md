The [[multiverse_theory | multiverse theory]] posits the existence of not just one universe, but an infinite number of them, with new universes continuously being created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This concept suggests that the number of universes and forms of matter could be infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Evidence and Testability
Currently, the [[multiverse_theory | multiverse theory]] remains a hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Concrete proof is needed for it to become a scientific fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
It is suggested that dark matter could provide this evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Most of the universe is composed of dark matter, which is not made of atoms, but rather a new substance believed to be another "octave" of the string in [[String Theory and the Universe | string theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

The [[multiverse_theory | multiverse theory]] is currently considered untestable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Origin of Universes
The [[multiverse_theory | multiverse theory]] can be analogized with soap bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. A soap bubble can collide with others, merge into larger bubbles, or burst into smaller ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This process is likened to the [[the_expansion_of_the_universe_and_the_Big_Bang_theory | Big Bang]], where collisions of these "bubbles" lead to the emergence and expansion of universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Our universe is one such bubble that expanded after an explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

## Connection to String Theory
The greatest challenge for quantum physics is the unification of quantum mechanics and relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. [[String Theory and the Universe | String theory]] is currently the only theory capable of achieving this unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. However, [[String Theory and the Universe | string theory]] presents an issue: it has an infinite number of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. These solutions correspond to different courses of [[the_expansion_of_the_universe_and_the_Big_Bang_theory | Big Bangs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, which can occur at any moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The fundamental question for [[String Theory and the Universe | string theory]] is identifying which of these infinite solutions describes our particular universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This requires a deeper understanding of the [[the_expansion_of_the_universe_and_the_Big_Bang_theory | Big Bang]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

[[String Theory and the Universe | String theory]] is also the only theory developed enough to explain not only protons and neutrons, but also dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Black Holes as Gateways
Some theories suggest that black holes could serve as gateways to other universes or dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Albert Einstein was among the first to discuss this concept, suggesting in 1935 that a black hole might be a gateway to another universe, resembling a funnel with a neck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. He connected two such funnels, implying another black hole on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Today, these are known as [[black_holes_and_universe_creation_theory | Einstein-Rosen bridges]], which are theoretical connections between universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## The Universe's Demise and Escape
The universe is expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. According to some theories, this expansion will continue indefinitely, leading to the universe becoming progressively colder until everything freezes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The Earth is predicted to be absorbed by the sun in 5 billion years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. When the sun dies, it will freeze, not burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Similarly, other stars will exhaust their nuclear energy and also turn into ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

If the [[multiverse_theory | multiverse theory]] is correct, our universe will likely freeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The only hypothetical way to avoid the ultimate death of our universe might be to escape from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This could involve creating an artificial space-time tunnel to another "bubble" (universe) or building a "lifeboat" to transfer intelligent life from a dying universe to a young, new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Multiverse vs. Simulation Theory
The [[multiverse_theory | multiverse theory]] differs from [[simulation_theory_and_the_multiverse | simulation theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. [[simulation_theory_and_the_multiverse | Simulation theory]], often depicted in science fiction like *The Matrix*, suggests that our reality is a programmed simulation where an external entity controls our existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. However, this idea is thought to be inconsistent with quantum mechanics, particularly the uncertainty principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. A [[simulation_theory_and_the_multiverse | simulation theory]] like the Matrix is seen as a "Newtonian type theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, whereas the universe is based on quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

Quantum mechanics, with its inherent uncertainty, allows for concepts like creativity, thinking, and consciousness, suggesting that consciousness might be a byproduct of quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. In contrast, a purely deterministic or "digital brain" would lack free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

## Dimensions in the Multiverse
Our perception of reality is limited by our three-dimensional existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. However, if [[String Theory and the Universe | string theory]] is correct, there could be 11 dimensions in hyperspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. Some scientists believe there are over 20 dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. [[String Theory and the Universe | String theory]] is stable in 10 and 11 dimensions but unstable in higher dimensions (e.g., 13, 14, 15) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. This unique property makes [[String Theory and the Universe | string theory]] the only scientific theory that dictates its own dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

The [[the_expansion_of_the_universe_and_the_Big_Bang_theory | Big Bang]], according to [[String Theory and the Universe | string theory]], is believed to have occurred in 11 dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>, resulting in our three-dimensional universe as one expanding bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

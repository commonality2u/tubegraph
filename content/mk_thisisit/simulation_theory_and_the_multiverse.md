## The Simulation Theory

The [[Simulation theory and the multiverse | simulation theory]] proposes that humanity lives within a simulated reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. This concept, often explored in science fiction like "The Matrix," leads people to question whether they are "puppets dancing when someone pulls the strings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:26">[01:23:26]</a> or if the universe can simply be started and stopped with a button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:39">[01:31:39]</a>.

However, the speaker believes such a simulation is not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:44">[01:42:44]</a>. The "Matrix" theory is considered "devoid of quantum mechanics" and is instead a "Newtonian type theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:32">[02:29:32]</a>. Since the universe is fundamentally based on quantum mechanics, not Newtonian physics, the speaker concludes that we do not live in a simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:39">[02:37:39]</a>.

## The Multiverse Theory

Quantum mechanics introduces the idea of "different alternative universes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:48">[01:44:48]</a>. This leads to the [[multiverse_theory | multiverse theory]], which the speaker states is "untestable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:57">[01:55:57]</a>. There is uncertainty about whether quantum mechanics truly yields these different universes, or if they are "fictional and invented in advance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:10">[02:02:10]</a>.

The [[multiverse_theory | multiverse theory]] cannot be tested and, in the speaker's opinion, "may also violate the principles of quantum mechanics, especially the uncertainty principle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:21">[02:17:21]</a>.

## Future Possibilities and Civilization Types

While current theories like the [[Simulation theory and the multiverse | simulation theory]] are dismissed, the speaker envisions a future where humans might gain god-like abilities, such as manipulating matter, energy, and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. This includes the potential to modify the human genome to adapt to different environments in the universe, rather than altering planets to suit humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.

The concept of civilization types, as analyzed by physicists, provides a framework for understanding advanced societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>:
*   **Type 1 Civilization:** Controls all energy of its planet, including solar energy, earthquakes, and volcanoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24:00">[23:24:00]</a>. A Type 1 civilization could only colonize a few planets in its solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>.
*   **Type 2 Civilization:** Utilizes the energy of both its planet and its sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:00">[23:39:00]</a>. The Federation of Planets in Star Trek would be an example of a Type 2 civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:59:00">[23:59:00]</a>. Even Type 2 civilizations cannot approach the speed of light for universe-wide travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:59:00">[24:59:00]</a>.
*   **Type 3 Civilization:** Possesses a galactic character, traveling along galactic routes and potentially manipulating [[black_holes_and_universe_creation_theory | black holes]] like in Star Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>. A Type 3 civilization might access Planck energy, which is the greatest energy in the universe, capable of making space itself unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>. By exceeding Planck energy, universes can form, potentially akin to the [[big_bang_theory_and_multiverse | Big Bang]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>. Such civilizations could use this as a gateway for space travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:00">[26:24:00]</a>.

The speaker predicts that humanity may one day become a Type 2 or Type 3 civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59:00">[22:59:00]</a>.

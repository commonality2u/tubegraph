Professor Piotr Moncarz, an engineer from Stanford University, has spearheaded the creation of the first [[polish_diaspora_and_silicon_valley_collaboration | Polish-American Hub]] to support Poland from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He highlights significant challenges regarding Poland's position in global science and technology, particularly concerning the [[export_of_polish_scientific_talent_and_its_consequences | export of Polish scientific talent]].

## The Drowning of Polish Science

A recent statement from the Polish Academy of Sciences on Twitter, claiming "Polish science is drowning," sparked widespread discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Professor Moncarz acknowledges the danger in this assertion, noting that every instance of Polish talent aiding others in building something new diminishes Poland's opportunity to build it itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While science is global, it doesn't mean Polish universities should merely "polish diamonds" for other nations to benefit from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Currently, Poland is seen as having "zero zero" representation in international science and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Consequences of Talent Migration

Polish talent, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, participates at the highest international levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. However, this participation primarily occurs within international teams outside of Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, indicating a "fiasco" in Poland's preparation to be a significant player in the international market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Despite the talent being educated in Poland, the country receives disproportionately little benefit from it, especially considering the investment made through Polish education and state infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Lost Opportunities

When Polish talent helps other countries or companies build something new, Poland loses the chance to create that original thing itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Even global companies like Google, Intel, Volkswagen, and Siemens have laboratories in Poland, utilizing Polish talent to enhance their products under their own brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This means the "pearls" or "diamonds" cut in Poland contribute to foreign brands, with little recognition for Poland itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Reasons for Talent Migration

### Low Wages and Lack of Cooperation

One of the primary reasons for the [[export_of_polish_scientific_talent_and_its_consequences | export of Polish scientific talent]] is the low wages at Polish universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The external market also does not cooperate sufficiently with universities to allow professors and their teams to improve their quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. For instance, a Stanford AI doctorate recipient can earn up to a million dollars a year as a first salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, making it difficult to retain top Polish scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

### Better Opportunities Abroad

While Poland cannot compete with American wages, the goal is to remain connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. The symbiosis between universities and the market, which is nascent in Poland, needs to develop to offer scientists satisfaction in doing work at home, preventing the need to emigrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Although modern Polish laboratories are well-equipped, the challenge lies in utilizing them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. The social position of a scientist and professor in Poland has declined, making it harder to attract and retain talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## Poland's Strengths

Despite the challenges, Poland possesses significant strengths that are evident in its talent.

### Mathematical and Programming Prowess
[[impact_of_cultural_and_educational_factors_on_polish_programming_talent | Poland's success in international programming competitions]] and subject olympiads (mathematics, chemistry, computer science) is notable, placing it among leading countries worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. This points to a strong tradition of excellent educational preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Polish high school graduates show great openness to the world and strong social contact skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

### Creativity and Resilience
Polish history has fostered immense creativity, as survival often required ingenuity and breaking through difficult systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. The saying "a Pole can" is not stupid, as Poles have demonstrated the ability to thrive in challenging conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Many educated Poles who left the country have achieved elite status abroad, showcasing strong preparation and energy to break through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

## Addressing the Problem

The core challenge is to create conditions in Poland that allow talented individuals to achieve success at home and project it globally, rather than having to emigrate to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

### Poland.ai and Collaboration
The institution known as Poland.ai (Polish-American Valley) was created as a [[polish_diaspora_and_silicon_valley_collaboration | Polish-American Hub]] to showcase Poland's highest intellect and entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This initiative aims to act as an enterprise, providing specific products and results to Polish clients (universities, companies, cities) who invest in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[polands_representation_in_global_technology_hubs | Poland's Representation in Global Technology Hubs]]
> Poland is notably one of the few EU countries without state representation in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Other EU countries have dozens of centers representing their science, business, and investments, while Poland registers "zero zeros" in each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The Polish-American Hub, established by the Polish community, functions as a de facto formal public representation, similar to how other nations operate their hubs with government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.

### Social Awareness and Interdependence
A recent incident involving Professor Piotr Sankowski and the fate of the Polish artificial intelligence institute brought public attention to the issue of scientists leaving Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This public resistance influenced authorities to maintain the institute and establish a new one for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. This suggests a potential shift in social attitudes towards the position of scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

Professor Moncarz emphasizes that "teamwork for the common good" is not a Polish strength, unlike in America where integrated work towards a common goal is highly developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. He hopes Poland can better understand interdependence as a positive element, beyond just patriotism, extending to professional collaboration within companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.

## Global Context and European Union

Europe is in the process of catching up with global leaders in technology, having "slept through a huge period of technological development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. A report by Professor Mario Drai noted that out of 300 key technologies, the EU only leads in regulating artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. Moncarz expresses skepticism and criticism towards the excessive bureaucracy built by the European Union, which he believes hinders innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Over-regulation
> The EU's focus on regulation, while potentially aiming to protect values like privacy and ethical AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>, can be seen as blocking development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. The United States, despite its imperfections, remains a better model for openness to new solutions compared to Europe's over-regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>.

## A Personal Story: Piotr Moncarz's Journey

Piotr Moncarz's path to the United States began after he found himself dissatisfied with repeating studies in Munich despite already having an engineering degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. A German colleague suggested he go to the States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. He initially pursued a master's degree in Colorado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. His then-girlfriend, now wife, wanted to move from Colorado, leading him to consider doctoral studies at Berkeley or Stanford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. He completed his doctorate at Stanford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>.

In the US, it's uncommon to stay at the same university after a doctorate; one typically moves to gain experience before potentially returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>. His wife insisted on Palo Alto or London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. He found a company in Palo Alto and began his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>. Stanford later invited him back as a professor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. He views his journey as a series of fortunate coincidences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

He identifies more as Polish, feeling the "essence of Poland" deeply, having learned and appreciated America as an adult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>. His frequent visits to Poland are for "oxygen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

The discussion with Professor Krzysztof Zan in Castel Gandolfo, as part of a Master's program, explores the profound [[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | implications of technology]], particularly [[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | Artificial Intelligence]] (AI), on humanity's present and future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Humanity's Evolving Nature

Humanity has long been described by various adjectives, such as "homo economicus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, a new term, "homo technicus" or "technological man," is increasingly used in biology to define humanity's current state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This reflects the profound dependence on technology, which has significantly improved living conditions, offering comfort and abundance previously unknown in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Technology's influence extends beyond convenience, fundamentally altering human biology. Examples include changes in skin coverings and eye functioning systems due to exposure to blue light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. More significant transformations are anticipated with [[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | future prospects]] like genetic engineering, which could expand memory, enhance imagination, and biologically improve humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This raises a crucial question: whether this "Trans man" will still be considered human, or if a new, better species will emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

> "genetic engineering will come which will allow us for example to expand our memory expand our imagination improve ourselves biologically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>
> "we will not know In the end whether to call this Trans man a human or will he already be another species better than us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>

## [[Creation and Implications of Super Artificial Intelligence | Artificial Intelligence]]: Threat or Tool?

[[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) is viewed by some as a powerful statistical machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. However, there is a fear that [[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | AI]] could become a creature capable of gaining consciousness and self-awareness, making decisions in its own interest rather than its creator's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### The Question of AI Experiencing Pain

A provocative question arises regarding the capacity of complex synthetic [[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | artificial neural networks]] to generate pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Research from the University of Queensland suggests that such systems already possess this ability, though the integration of [[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | AI]] robotics hasn't yet reached a level allowing for the perception of this pain due to a lack of an interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

The definition of pain is critical in this context; somatic pain originates in the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. If [[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | AI]] were to genuinely feel pain, it would necessitate re-evaluating its status, potentially requiring protection as a living organism or an animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. However, making definitive statements on this matter is cautioned against due to the deep ignorance surrounding such complex issues, advocating for humility and the emergence of undeniable evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

> "complex synthetic artificial neural networks today already have the ability to generate pain, i.e. in this black box pain is already being created today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
> "The awareness of this pain belongs to man And who belongs to the awareness of the machine's pain, does it feel it itself or does it transmit it outside, it's a very big difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>

## The Human Element

The pursuit of meaning in life has been a constant quest, bringing pain with every profound question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The modern world, influenced by a "civilization of a full belly," has seen a shift towards extreme individualism, focusing on "I" rather than "we" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This current era of perceived safety and prosperity, unlike historical periods marked by hunger, cold, and epidemics, fosters an illusion of invincibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

However, this sense of security is fleeting, and vigilance is necessary because "we are never safe and never this full the belly is not guaranteed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. The fragility of life and human plans remains a constant, and technology itself can fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

The search for meaning, often depicted in art like Krzysztof Zan's film *The Perfect Number*, offers solace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. The concept that information is not lost, as proposed by Mr. Penrose, suggests that "total death" cannot exist, as individuals leave behind vital information about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This belief can offer hope that even after physical departure, something significant persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Ultimately, the quest for meaning, especially through immersing oneself in true love, provides an "indisputable" purpose for living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. While embracing big questions can be painful, it is a uniquely human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

> "every big question about meaning hurts a little and it hurts us people and not [[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | artificial intelligence]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
> "if a person immerses himself in some true love then this meaning is already indisputable he already knows why he lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>

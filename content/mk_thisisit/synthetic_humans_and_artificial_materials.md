A Polish team of engineers has embarked on creating the world's first [[biomimetic robots and human imitation | biomimetic robot]], which aims to mimic the soft tissues of a human being, essentially acting as a "clone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Their ultimate goal is for this work to be indistinguishable from living people in a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Pursuit of Biomimicry
The project is rooted in the belief that no machine can compete with the versatility of a human being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. To accurately reproduce the human body from [[synthetic_proteins_and_their_design | artificial materials]], the team has made approximately 20 visits to mortuaries over ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. These visits are crucial to understand the intricate construction of the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The concept of a "synthetic human" refers to a being created from [[synthetic_proteins_and_their_design | artificial materials]], specifically polymers, designed to replicate human motor skills and body manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The team aims to faithfully reproduce nature, using terms like "artificial human" or "human clone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Unlike other robots, their design reflects human biomechanics from the deepest tissues, including bone, to the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This includes replicating artificial muscles, skeletons, ligaments, fascia, and even the guiding structures for tendons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The structure of the human body is being reflected as much as possible, and anatomical solutions are sought whenever problems arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Materials and Design Philosophy
The robot is primarily constructed from polymers, some easily accessible, others with specific mechanical parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. These materials are lightweight, easy to process, and cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The entire body, except for a small copper valve needed to translate nerve impulses into mechanical work, is made of non-metallic materials, with less than a per mille of metal even in the limbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

The design philosophy emphasizes replicating human complexity:
*   **Soft Tissues and Joints**: The robot incorporates soft tissues and fat, allowing the hand to tighten into balls rather than cylinders, unlike typical robotic hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Joints are connected by ligaments, cartilages, and menisci, avoiding mechanical hinges or balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Locomotion**: The robot's walking gait is designed to be natural, replicating the known walking pattern, which is a major difference from other robots that simplify human movement, leading to unnatural gaits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Its leg is adapted for natural walking, like a human's, and with appropriate computer models and sensors, it will walk, run, and jump like a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   **Circulatory System**: A simulated circulatory system includes high and low pressure, analogous to the aorta and veins, containing a water-like fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Nervous System**: A nervous system, mirroring the spinal cord, distributes custom electronics around the body similar to human nerves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Power and Internal Organs**: While currently powered by a lithium-ion battery, the long-term vision includes a [[synthetic_proteins_and_their_design | chemical]] energy source, with a digestive system in the stomach that uses chemical reactions to produce flammable gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. These gases power a diaphragm pump shaped like a heart, converting gas pressure into water pressure to drive the robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Lungs will be used for storing excess gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. The goal is for the robot to consume "garbage" as fuel, enabling self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
*   **Proprietary Valves**: The team developed their own proportional valves that offer full control over fluid flow (from 0% to 100%), crucial for the fluid movements seen in their prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## Development and Purpose
The project began with the hand, which took nine years to develop due to the complexity of establishing biomechanical and anatomical principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Once these principles were established, the entire robot, including legs, was scaled up rapidly using anatomical atlases and mortuary visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The team employs doctors, including an anatomist, who are instrumental in the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

The primary purpose of this robot is to "reverse entropy" by performing tasks like cleaning and organizing that are continuous and never-ending for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Beyond household chores, these robots are envisioned as tools for:
*   Conducting scientific experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>
*   Creating new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>
*   Developing civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>
*   Being sent to other celestial bodies, like establishing bases on Mars or digging asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>
*   Working in factories and dangerous environments like burning buildings or disaster areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>

## [[Artificial intelligence and future prospects | Future Prospects and Ethical Considerations]]
While the physical structure is highly advanced, the robot currently lacks an [[Artificial intelligence and consciousness | autonomous brain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. All current demonstrations use pre-programmed muscle sequences or teleoperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. The development of [[artificial_intelligence_and_societal_impact | artificial intelligence]], including neural networks and physical simulations, is ongoing in Wroc≈Çaw and California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. The robot is expected to walk and "think" with a neural network this year, with the walking algorithm developed in a physical simulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

The team explicitly states that they do not want to mirror human cells or create organic matter, as that would be akin to creating a "zombie" with human flesh and blood, which they deem unethical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Their robot is designed to be completely soft and deformable, meaning it can be cut, bleed out, and broken like a human, making it the "opposite of a Terminator" and safer than metal robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. They advocate for humanity to focus on eliminating war technology rather than fearing beneficial robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.

The goal is to overcome the "Uncanny Valley" effect, where robots that closely but imperfectly resemble humans cause unease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. Their robot's facial muscles will be fully modeled, making it indistinguishable from a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. While the first "Alpha clone" models will not have a face as it's not essential for functionality, it will be a "cherry on the cake" to prove the possibility of an indistinguishable robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

The developers view themselves as utopians, aiming for a future where everyone is healthy and prosperous, with an "overproduction" of goods due to robots working in factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. They believe that with mass-produced robots, people will gain significant time back from chores, allowing for societal advancement through scientific research and technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. They emphasize that technological development should go hand in hand with spiritual development, as happiness stems from the spirit, which the robot can serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.

The first 279 "Alpha clone" models will be a premium product, costing over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. Subsequent models, intended for mass production, are projected to sell for around $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. The team anticipates finishing the robot by 2026, provided they secure funding, which they believe will lead to exponential progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. There is significant market interest, particularly from industries like carbon fiber manufacturing, where the precision and versatility of a human-like hand are irreplaceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>.

The company is a Polish-American venture, with technical development and production scaling in Poland, and [[artificial_intelligence_and_future_prospects | brain development]] in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. The founder, who initially named the robot "Golem" due to its function as a synthetically produced servant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>, sees the project as his daily motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. He aims to make it impossible for the robot to be used for harm, with an absolute ban on contact with weapons or harming living beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

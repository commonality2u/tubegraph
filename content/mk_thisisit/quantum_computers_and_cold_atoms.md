The field of ultracold atoms is crucial for understanding and developing [[quantum_computing_technologies | quantum technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This area of physics focuses on manipulating individual atoms and molecules at extremely low temperatures, where quantum effects become observable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Ultracold Environments

Laboratories in places like Warsaw and CERN are home to the coldest and hottest places in the universe, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The temperatures achieved with cold atoms are de facto a billion times less than room temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, approaching absolute zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. While true absolute zero cannot be reached, systems can be cooled arbitrarily close to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. If no alien civilizations exist, then experiments with [[ultracold_atoms_and_their_applications | cold atoms]] in laboratories on Earth, including those in Warsaw, host the coldest places in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

At these extremely low temperatures, atoms move incredibly slowly, nearing the minimum possible energy they can possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Temperature itself is a measure of the energy atoms and molecules have, reflecting their average speed and movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Manipulating Single Atoms and Ions

Recent advancements in physics have made it possible to manipulate individual atoms, which is considered an incredible achievement given their vast numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. A significant achievement involved cooling a single ion to temperatures close to one micro Kelvin—a record low for an ion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This was accomplished by immersing a single ion, caught in a complex trap, into a gas of very [[ultracold_atoms_and_their_applications | cold atoms]] and cooling it through collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

Methods for trapping and manipulating atoms include:
*   **Vacuum Chambers:** Experimental systems are isolated in high-quality vacuum chambers to prevent outside interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   **Magnetic Fields:** Atoms can be caught in suitably shaped magnetic fields that create a "trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.
*   **Optical Tweezers/Light Crystals:** Laser beams can be used to generate vapor of atoms and then catch them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. This involves the intersection of two or three laser beams, creating areas of high light intensity where atoms can be trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.
*   **Ionization:** For ions, it is simpler: a single atom can be ionized and then caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

It is even possible to photograph a single atom by collecting the light reflected from it, similar to how a camera captures an image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

## Quantum Phenomena at Ultralow Temperatures

At [[ultracold_atoms_and_their_applications | ultracold temperatures]], quantum effects become visible, as atoms move so slowly that their energy levels become quantized and discrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This "discreteness" of energy levels allows for novel phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

*   **Quantum Superposition:** With single ions, it is "very, very easy" to create a Schrödinger's cat state, where an ion can exist simultaneously in multiple places or states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. This can be observed by repeating experiments many times, revealing the probability distribution given by the wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.
*   **Control of Chemical Reactions:** At extremely low temperatures, external factors like magnetic fields can drastically influence the speed of chemical reactions, accelerating or slowing them down by a million times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This provides a deep, quantum-level understanding of chemical synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.
*   **Quantum Teleportation of Chemical Reactions:** Researchers contemplate the theoretical possibility of teleporting a chemical reaction, where a reaction happening with one ion could formally be considered to have occurred with a distant ion through a teleportation protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

These studies allow for precise investigations into the fundamental laws of nature, complementary to high-energy physics experiments like CERN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. By eliminating thermal noise at low temperatures, measurements of atomic and molecular structures can be made with much higher accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

While cold ions have always been considered for [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]], neutral cold atoms were previously a "Cinderella" technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. However, in the last five years, advancements in technologies utilizing [[ultracold_atoms_and_their_applications | cold atoms]] in optical networks (light crystals) and optical tweezers have shown the [[potential_of_universal_quantum_computers | potential]] to surpass other [[quantum_computing_technologies | quantum computing technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. This technology is being actively developed by groups at Harvard and in France, among others, demonstrating rapid progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>. This new class of [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] is being built on the basis of [[ultracold_atoms_and_their_applications | cold atoms]] in optical networks, employing techniques like Rydberg excitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>.

## Broader Implications

*   **Dark Matter Detection:** There are attempts to use [[ultracold_atoms_and_their_applications | cold atoms]] and highly accurate atomic clocks (based on ultracold atoms) to detect dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:36]</a>. This relies on the hypothesis that dark matter might have a domain structure that moves through the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.

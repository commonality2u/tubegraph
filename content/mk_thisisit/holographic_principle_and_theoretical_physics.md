The holographic principle has garnered significant interest in [[science_and_philosophy_of_physics | theoretical physics]], appearing to be the most cited work in the field over the past two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This work has led to the understanding that we might live inside a [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | giant quantum computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The principle suggests that the geometry of space could be a consequence of small vibrating entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Evolution of Theoretical Physics

[[science_and_philosophy_of_physics | Theoretical physicists]] today are often more fascinated by the workings of nature itself than by the traditional search for a [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | "theory of everything"]] or "grand theory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. While Grand Unification Theories were once fashionable, current interests lean towards understanding the connection with [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum computation]], which is considered far more intriguing than earlier "weak ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Nature, it seems, is proving to be much more complex and fascinating than initial human conceptualizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Classical vs. Quantum Behavior

A significant area of interest is the [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | emergence of classical behavior from quantum behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. In [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | classical physics]], Newton's First Law states that an object free from forces remains at rest or in uniform motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. However, in [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum theory]], if a particle's exact location is known, it immediately spreads out, simultaneously present at all points in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This is a fundamental difference: one particle can occupy many places at once, spreading out infinitely far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

For instance, an electron in a hydrogen atom, when released near a proton, fills the space around it, existing in multiple locations simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Chemical bonds, a consequence of this strange [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum behavior]], lead to emergent deterministic behavior when two hydrogen atoms bond; the electron is no longer everywhere but localized near the protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This suggests that the deterministic world we experience is an emergent consequence of interactions among many [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum particles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Free Will

From the perspective of [[quantum physics and consciousness | quantum physics]], it is debated whether humans possess free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. However, [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum mechanics]] itself does not seem to offer a way to introduce free will into theoretical frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Practically, it appears we have free will, even if philosophically we might not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Black Holes and the Universe's Origin

Research on black holes has significantly advanced our understanding of the universe.

### Origin of the Universe

While black holes do not directly answer how the universe was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, significant progress has been made in [[science_and_philosophy_of_physics | theoretical physics]] and observational cosmology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Precise measurements of relic radiation and galaxy formations support the inflation theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This theory posits that the entire observable universe once occupied a region a billion times smaller than a proton, where [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum mechanics]] effects were very significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The rapid expansion from this point left traces in the cosmic microwave background radiation and galaxy systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

The "hot big bang" (when the universe was a hot plasma) is understood as a consequence of this earlier period of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Particles originated from the decay of the inflaton field at the end of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. The question of what preceded inflation remains speculative, with ideas including an eternally recurring process creating "small big bangs" (a form of multiverse) or Penrose's cyclical cosmology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Holographic Principle Applied to Black Holes

The holographic principle, notably proposed by Susskind and 't Hooft, suggests that information about a region of space is encoded on its boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Juan Maldacena's work demonstrated its plausibility in a simplified universe, making it one of the most cited papers in [[science_and_philosophy_of_physics | theoretical physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This idea is more general than just black holes, implying that all information within a room, for example, could be encoded on its walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This is strange because the boundary has one less dimension than its interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

The essence of this theory is the possibility of formulating a [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum mechanics]] theory on a surface without gravity, which can still describe physics, including the appearance of an additional spatial dimension in the interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. This suggests that gravity is an emergent property of [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum mechanics]], not fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. If we understand [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum physics]] on the boundary, we can predict behavior in the interior, which includes gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

### Gravity as an Emergent Property

Stephen Hawking's early work on black hole mechanics indicated that the laws of gravity have a fundamentally thermodynamic origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Just as thermodynamics (temperature, pressure) emerges from the deeper understanding of vibrating atoms, it seems the geometry of space (gravity) is a consequence of some more fundamental "vibrating things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. Gravity is therefore not fundamental but follows from a more basic statistical picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. This aligns with the holographic principle, where gravity is an emergent property from a deeper [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum description of the world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. Experimental evidence for this would be one of the greatest discoveries in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

### Information Paradox and "No Hair" Theorem

The information paradox arises because [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum mechanics]] states that information cannot be completely annihilated, while general relativity suggests that information from objects falling into a black hole disappears into the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. Since black holes evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation, the question is what happens to the information of objects that fell in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. Recent calculations (2019) have largely proven that information does not disappear, as previously suggested by Maldacena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. Modern research addresses this using concepts from [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum computing]] and [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum information]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

The "no hair" theorem states that a black hole's information content is limited to its electric charge, mass, and angular momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. This means a black hole can be fully described by just three numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. "Hair" refers to additional information. When [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum mechanics]] is considered in relation to black holes, the "no hair" theorem, suggesting black holes are simple, is discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. This implies black holes are more complex than just their spin, mass, and angular momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

### Collaboration and Science Communication

Brian Cox, a popular physicist and author, collaborates on books about fundamental physics. Their works cover [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum physics]], Einstein's theories of relativity, and cosmology, including the Big Bang and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. Both are enthusiastic about communicating complex ideas and achievements in fundamental sciences to a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.

## Artificial Intelligence in Physics

The recognition of artificial intelligence (AI) by committees like the Nobel Committee, even if not directly in physics, signals its growing importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. While controversial, some see it as extraordinary physics in a broader sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. The rapid development of AI, particularly large language models like GPT Chat, is seen as incredibly helpful for work and research, though these models primarily synthesize existing knowledge rather than generating new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

The question remains whether AI, with abstract thinking and reasoning capabilities, will one day help answer fundamental questions about reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>. There is no clear consensus on whether superhuman strong artificial intelligence (AGI) is achievable or even desirable, with many great minds admitting they "don't know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. While AGI could potentially answer all questions, some physicists might find it "a bit sad" if humanity didn't figure it out themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>.

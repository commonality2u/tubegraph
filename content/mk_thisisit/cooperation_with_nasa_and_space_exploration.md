Ryan Po≈∫niak Daniels, at 22 years old, has played a significant role in advanced space technology, notably in **augmented reality (AR)** and **virtual reality (VR)** applications for space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His work extends to collaborations with NASA and SpaceX, focusing on how these technologies can assist astronauts and educate the public about space.

## Contributions to NASA Missions

Ryan led a research team that participated in a competition organized by NASA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>. The objective was to invent a new type of [[synchronization_protocols_and_implications_for_space_exploration|augmented reality]] application interface for astronauts to use on the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>.

### Artemis Program Support
NASA is currently preparing the first human mission to the Moon since the historic Apollo mission, over 50 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48">[01:14:48]</a>. Unlike previous missions that predominantly sent robots, this mission will involve human astronauts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48">[01:14:48]</a>. Ryan's team was accepted by NASA to create and cooperate on this project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:48">[01:21:48]</a>.

Their work involves developing:
*   **Augmented reality glasses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">[01:31:05]</a>.
*   A **specially created interface** for these glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:05">[01:31:05]</a>.

This technology will be integrated into astronaut helmets, allowing them to:
*   Check vital parameters such as oxygen levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>.
*   Determine the proper direction for movement while walking on the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>.

This project is described as "first of its kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:13">[01:39:13]</a>, and Ryan emphasizes its significance in advancing humanity's progress in space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:13">[01:39:13]</a>.

## Collaboration with SpaceX

Ryan's interest in space and [[the_role_of_space_technology_in_modern_science_and_industry|space technology]] led him to cooperate with SpaceX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:31">[01:44:31]</a>. He contributed to developing a **virtual reality application** designed to educate people about what it means to be an astronaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:10">[01:49:10]</a>.

The application allows users to experience:
*   The realities of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:04">[01:50:04]</a>.
*   The concept of colonizing other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:04">[01:50:04]</a>.
*   How visits to the International Space Station occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:04">[01:50:04]</a>.

This immersive experience, available through VR glasses, allows users to "magically move into space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">[01:52:16]</a> and practically experience being an astronaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">[01:52:16]</a>. Ryan believes that this technology is amazing, enabling people to explore space in a way that was once impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">[01:52:16]</a>.

## Vision for Future Space Exploration

Ryan is a strong advocate for humanity's future in space, believing that one day humans will explore and live on other planets, including Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>. He sees [[synchronization_protocols_and_implications_for_space_exploration|augmented reality]] as a crucial tool for achieving this future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:27">[01:18:27]</a> "I am a huge supporter of the fact that one day humanity will be able to explore and live on other planets. I think that in the future we will go to Mars to all planets and augmented reality will be a help in achieving what is"

He also notes that Artificial Intelligence is one of the most important methods that allow us to [[exploration_and_research_of_extraterrestrial_life_and_UFOs|explore the Moon or other planets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.

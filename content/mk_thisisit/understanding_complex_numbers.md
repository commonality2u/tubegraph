Complex numbers are a fundamental concept in mathematics, introduced to enable operations like multiplication on points in a plane, which was not previously possible through traditional arithmetic. They are considered an elegant solution that broadens the scope of mathematical operations and provides deep insights into various fields of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Origin of Complex Numbers

Historically, mathematicians initially considered the idea of adding points on a plane to be nonsensical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. However, the introduction of the [[Mathematical interpretations of geometric principles|coordinate system]] by Descartes enabled the addition of points by summing their respective coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. For example, two points (a, b) and (c, d) could be added to yield (a+c, b+d) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

The desire to extend this capability to multiplication led to a new notation for points: (a, b) was re-expressed as `a + ib` (or `a + *i*b` using the speaker's notation `a + and b`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. When attempting to multiply two such expressions, for example, `(a + ib) * (c + id)`, an `i²` term naturally arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. This `i²` initially had no meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## The Imaginary Unit 'i'

To define multiplication for points on a plane, mathematicians introduced the "imaginary unit," denoted as `i` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This unit is defined by the property that `i² = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. While there is no real number that, when squared, results in -1, mathematicians "invented" such a number to solve this problem, thereby enabling the multiplication of points on the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

## Role in Euler's Formula

[[Eulers formula|Euler's formula]], `e^(ix) = cos(x) + i sin(x)`, is considered one of the most elegant and beautiful formulas in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. It uniquely combines five fundamental mathematical constants: 0, 1, π, *e*, and `i` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. These numbers originate from diverse areas of mathematics, including trigonometry, [[complex_numbers_and_their_role_in_quantum_mechanics|complex numbers]], and mathematical analysis (differential calculus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The formula demonstrates how the imaginary unit `i` links the exponential function `e^x` with trigonometric functions (sine and cosine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Specifically, it shows that raising `e` to the power of `ix` (where `x` is a real number) results in a complex number whose real part is `cos(x)` and imaginary part is `sin(x)`. This can be visualized as a point on a unit circle in the complex plane, where `x` represents the arc length from the positive x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

For example, when `x = π`, Euler's formula becomes `e^(iπ) = cos(π) + i sin(π)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Since `cos(π) = -1` and `sin(π) = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, this simplifies to `e^(iπ) = -1 + i(0)`, or `e^(iπ) + 1 = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, a concise expression highlighting the deep connections between these fundamental constants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

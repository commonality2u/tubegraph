[[Sir Roger Penrose and his contributions to physics | Sir Roger Penrose]] frequently mentions his [[experiences_working_with_stephen_hawking | collaboration with Steven Hawking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Division of Authorship and Ideas
When discussing their joint work, Penrose states that he was "mainly" the author <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, and "the key ideas were mine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. He reiterates this, claiming that "almost all of these concepts belong more to Pen Rose than to Hawking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>, and again that it was "mainly me who was the author" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:13">[01:31:13]</a>. While Penrose credits himself for the key ideas, he acknowledges that Hawking "developed certain techniques more than I did" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:48">[01:38:48]</a>.

## Hawking's Role and Early Work
Penrose notes that Hawking was "better at drawing attention to his work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>. He also recalls that Steven Hawking's early work "was full of errors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>. Many of these errors were corrected by Brandon Carter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:27">[01:31:27]</a>, but Hawking himself was capable of spotting and correcting them for his doctoral thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>. Penrose served as one of the reviewers for Hawking's doctoral thesis, pointing out various mistakes that Hawking had corrected by the time of his examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">[01:31:38]</a>.

## Terminology and Primary Contributions
Penrose mentions that when he later worked with Steven Hawking, Hawking "used different concepts than those I originally used" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:06">[04:36:06]</a>, and that he adopted Hawking's terminology, even though it was not his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:27">[04:44:27]</a>.

Hawking's "most important work" concerned "the [[event_horizon_and_hawking_radiation | evaporation of black holes]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a>. Penrose indicates that he was not alone in this, suggesting that the initial ideas came from him, but many of the later technical issues were developed by Hawking himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>. This concept of "[[event_horizon_and_hawking_radiation | Hawking pairing]]" or evaporation is considered Hawking's "enormous contribution to science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:5:25">[01:5:25]</a>. Hawking discovered that black holes, contrary to being completely cold, possess some temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:5:31">[01:5:31]</a>.

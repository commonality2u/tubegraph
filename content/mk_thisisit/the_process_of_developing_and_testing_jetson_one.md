Its creator envisions Jetson as "the Tesla of flying cars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Deliveries are projected to begin at the end of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The overarching mission of the company is to shift personal movement from the ground to the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Inspiration and Genesis

The concept for the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] was not a singular moment of inspiration, but rather a culmination of years of working with flying devices like drones and remote-controlled helicopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The creator had a company for over a decade that specialized in aerial photography and filmmaking, where cameras and cargo needs grew, making it "obvious" that self-flight would eventually be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Ideas for personal electric helicopters were sketched during architecture studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, and several films about kids building flying machines also served as inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Early Prototypes and First Flight

The first prototype of the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] was created in Italy in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This initial prototype was constructed in two weeks, starting from a notebook sketch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. It utilized simple materials like aluminum profiles and was assembled with basic hobby tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The first unmanned flights involved adding ballast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. The very first manned flight was undertaken by the creator himself in Pontedera, Italy, which hosts the headquarters of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## [[Challenges and milestones in building a flying vehicle | Development Challenges]]

The development process, while enjoyable, also presented [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry | difficulties]]. The creator notes "typical startup problems" and "ego problems" as the most challenging aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The early workshop in Italy was a neglected silk factory where the creator lived for several months, enduring conditions without air conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

## Manufacturing and Technology

The development and production process heavily utilizes 3D printers for parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The creator embraces this technology for its flexibility, allowing parts to be changed and tested daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]]'s arms are made from optimized carbon fiber by a company that also produces elements for supercars, making them lighter and more durable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

## Pilot Training and Control

To prepare future pilots, a simulator is used, with a more advanced version featuring a 360-degree screen currently under development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The simulator helps build "muscle memory" despite the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]]'s intuitive control system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] is controlled by a single four-axis joystick: pushing up increases altitude, pulling down decreases it, and tilting forward/backward moves the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. A slight upward push initiates takeoff automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. A key safety feature is that releasing the joystick causes the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] to hover in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The software for the simulator's system was developed in Gdynia, Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## [[Challenges and milestones in building a flying vehicle | Key Milestones]] and Recognition

One of the most significant moments was the premiere of the first [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] film on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The film went viral within a week, gaining millions of views, far exceeding expectations of 20-50 clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This demonstrated that people saw something special in it, beyond just another gadget, that "worked on the imagination on a larger scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The visual appeal of the vehicle flying over the Błędowska Desert, evoking associations with science fiction and Star Wars, contributed to its virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

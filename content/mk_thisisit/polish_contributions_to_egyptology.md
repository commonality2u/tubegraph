Professor Karol Myśliwiec, a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and one of the world's most distinguished archaeologists and Egyptologists, has dedicated over half a century to work in Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. His extensive career has been marked by numerous significant discoveries that have reshaped the understanding of [[ancient_egypt_and_ptolemaic_period_discoveries | Ancient Egypt and Ptolemaic period discoveries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Groundbreaking Excavations

### Tell Atrib (The "Garbage Dump")

Professor Myśliwiec's greatest scientific experience came from his work in Tell Atrib, an ancient town approximately 50 km north of Cairo, known in Arabic as "the theater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Initially perceived as a "garbage dump" on the main street, these excavations proved to be scientifically crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

During these digs, Myśliwiec realized they were walking through a city from the Ptolemaic period (the last three centuries BC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Discoveries could be made merely by inserting a shovel 5 cm deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Beneath this layer, further strata reached back 300 years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. These layers were precisely separated and could be dated with absolute accuracy using well-preserved coins and ceramic amphora stamps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This allowed for dating monuments that were previously dated with an accuracy of 500 to 1000 years, now to within 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Such a scientific phenomenon had never occurred in the Nile Delta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

The findings from Tell Atrib shed entirely new light on Egypt during the era of Alexander the Great to Cleopatra VII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The work was so impactful that, after one of Myśliwiec's lectures in Britain, signatures under monuments in a gallery exhibition were changed overnight, as discoveries proved artifacts were 500 years younger or older than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Similarly, after a lecture in Paris, Professor Franco, a leading expert on terracottas of the Greco-Roman period, had to reassess her recently published three volumes, as Polish excavations showed many items she dated to the Roman period were actually 500 years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. These excavations "shocked the scientific world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

### Saqqara (The "Bush")

Another significant area of Polish excavation is Saqqara, specifically on the western, desert side of the Djoser pyramid, the oldest pyramid in the world, built around 2650 BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. Despite a leading Egyptian and French architect advising that "there is definitely nothing there" and it's "at most a dump," Professor Myśliwiec proceeded with excavations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. His conviction stemmed from the understanding that the western direction in [[ancient_egypt_and_ptolemaic_period_discoveries | Ancient Egypt and Ptolemaic period discoveries]] was dedicated to the dead, and funerary monuments were always placed on the west side of cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

Here, a magnificent necropolis and the tomb of a vizier from a period 300 years after the oldest pyramid were discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. This tomb, with its excellently preserved reliefs and paintings, offers insight into family and social relations during a time when the pharaonic state began to decline, possibly due to climate change and the excessive development of the official class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. The [[ancient_egypt_and_ptolemaic_period_discoveries | ancient Egyptians]] did notice climate changes, with evidence preserved in texts and the need to protect tombs from water runoff due to heavy rains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

## Key Insights and Methodologies

Polish Egyptologists, including Professor Myśliwiec, contribute significantly to [[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Poland's development in the scientific community]] and [[polish_culture_and_technological_innovation | Polish Culture and Technological Innovation]] in the field of archaeology.

### Ceramology and Dating

One crucial scientific development in Egyptology over the last 50 years, which Polish researchers have embraced, is ceramology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Previously, archaeologists focused on the most beautiful and preserved ceramic examples. However, ceramic sherds found on the surface provide legitimate clues about what lies underground, allowing for precise dating of archaeological layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

### Archaeological Practices

The [[archaeological_practices_and_ethics_in_egypt | Archaeological practices and ethics in Egypt]] highlight that there is no single recipe for excavations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Methods must be adapted to the specific site, period, and preservation state of monuments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. Polish missions prioritize immediate conservation of fragile objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. Geophysical methods are increasingly used to determine what is underground without excavation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Challenges include unstable terrain, subsurface water in the Nile Delta, and the need to acquire land for temporary digs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

### Understanding Ancient Egyptian Society

Myśliwiec's research indicates that [[ancient_egypt_and_ptolemaic_period_discoveries | ancient Egyptians]] possessed a profound understanding of human nature, recognizing elements of both good and evil within every person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. This contrasts with modern tendencies to categorize individuals strictly as "good" or "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

Regarding the construction of pyramids, Professor Myśliwiec asserts that there was no slavery in Egypt; the laborers were hired people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Stories about Egyptian slavery are largely considered "fairy tales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

## Unanswered Mysteries and Future Endeavors

Professor Myśliwiec believes two great mysteries in Egyptology await explanation:

1.  **The Tomb of Imhotep**: The creator of the world's oldest pyramid, his tomb is still undiscovered, though certainly somewhere near the Djoser pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
2.  **The Temporary Burial Place of Alexander the Great**: Evidence suggests Alexander's mummy was provisionally housed in Saqqara before being moved to Alexandria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. A group of unnoticed Ptolemaic sculptures near the Djoser pyramid, representing Greek philosophers and scholars, may sanctify the nearby temporary presence of Alexander's mummy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

Professor Myśliwiec postulates that Alexander the Great was first buried in one of the already existing tombs, which was later emptied when his body was transferred to Alexandria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. While the tomb itself might lack artifacts, inscriptions could indicate its temporary use for Alexander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

Polish archaeological missions are among the most numerous in Egypt, covering almost all historical periods of [[ancient_egypt_and_ptolemaic_period_discoveries | Ancient Egypt and Ptolemaic period discoveries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. Pioneer Professor Michałowski focused on Greco-Roman Egypt, but contemporary Polish efforts delve into older eras, including the formation of Egyptian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Polish excavations, particularly those conducted by colleagues from Poznań and Kraków, have shown that the creation of the unified Egyptian state was a gradual evolution over hundreds of years, alongside cultural, technological, and societal organization growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

Polish Egyptologists are also expanding their work beyond Egypt to regions like South America and East Asia, including China and India, where new archaeological missions are beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. The ongoing work of Polish scholars, both in the field and through analysis of existing collections, ensures that Egyptology remains a vibrant and evolving field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

Professor Karol Myśliwiec, a renowned Polish archaeologist and Egyptologist, discusses the profound influence of ancient Egyptian culture on various modern traditions, particularly Christian ones, highlighting parallels in rituals and ethical concepts.

## Ritual Parallels

According to Professor Myśliwiec, there are extensive similarities between modern rituals and those practiced in [[ancient_egypt_and_ptolemaic_period_discoveries | ancient Egypt]]. He states that "today's rituals... do not differ from the rituals of [[ancient_egypt_and_ptolemaic_period_discoveries | ancient Egypt]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>. These include:
*   **Processions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>
*   **Singing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>
*   **Elements of dances** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>
*   **Incensing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>
*   **Carrying statues** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>

These practices were already present in ancient Egypt and even influenced the Muslim world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. Professor Myśliwiec points out that celebrations in the Temple of Luxor today have parallels with ancient Egyptian holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>. He suggests that such ritual forms are natural for promoting any faith to an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>.

## Ethical Similarities

Beyond rituals, Professor Myśliwiec believes that a significant amount of Christian ethics was borrowed from [[ancient_egypt_and_ptolemaic_period_discoveries | ancient Egypt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>.
*   **Confession:** While modern Catholic confession is a medieval invention, a form of "negative confession" existed in ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>. This concept is found in the *Book of the Dead*, a religious text placed with the deceased, particularly dignitaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>. In this negative confession, the deceased lists things they did *not* do, such as "not to have sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.

## Sexuality and Societal Norms

The professor observes that the Egyptians were not prudish by modern standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>. Sexual matters were openly displayed, even in temples, with depictions of ithyphallic gods like Min, symbolizing fertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>. This nudity and openness persisted into Greek times, where the Greeks encountered similar phenomena in Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:59">[01:08:59]</a>.

The Egyptian view of sex was primarily linked to fertility and procreation, which was considered sacred for securing a future in the afterlife and leaving descendants on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>. This differs from what is often termed "pornography" today, but it underscores a society unconcerned with prudery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>.

## [[role_of_women_and_social_dynamics_in_ancient_egyptian_society | Role of Women]] and Marriage

Marriage in [[ancient_egypt_and_ptolemaic_period_discoveries | ancient Egypt]] often involved legal contracts, detailing dowry and future division of assets, a practice similar to modern Muslim societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>. Women in ancient Egypt enjoyed significant respect, especially as mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>. While marriage was sacred, infidelity did occur, with morality depending on social class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.

Women could significantly influence marital decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. Female pharaohs, like Hatshepsut, often rose to power during times of instability or when male successors were unsuitable, a phenomenon observed at various points in Egyptian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>. Professor Myśliwiec notes that this pattern, where women assume important political roles when men are deemed "no longer suitable," is similar to modern trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:28">[01:16:28]</a>.

The concept of traveling at speeds greater than light, or faster-than-light (FTL), has been a significant topic of discussion in [[physics_of_fasterthanlight_travel | physics]] for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Apparent Faster-Than-Light Phenomena
While direct FTL travel for objects with mass is prohibited by Einstein's theory of relativity, certain phenomena appear to exceed the speed of light:
*   **Expanding Space** The oldest galaxies observed are moving away from us at speeds many times greater than the speed of light, as evidenced by their shift towards the infrared spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. This does not violate Einstein's laws because it is space itself that is expanding at these higher speeds, not the objects moving *through* space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

## Historical Attempts and Misconceptions
Around a dozen years ago, there was considerable excitement about the possibility of achieving speeds greater than light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **OPERA Neutrino Anomaly** An experiment between CERN and San Grasso involving neutrinos seemed to indicate they arrived slightly faster than light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. However, this was later identified as a technical error due to an incorrectly calculated length of optical fiber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. This incident reaffirmed that the laws of [[physics_of_fasterthanlight_travel | physics]], specifically Einstein's theory of relativity, still apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## Theoretical Approaches to Faster-Than-Light Travel
While direct FTL travel is not possible under current understanding, theoretical concepts offer potential avenues:

### [[Wormholes and spacetime tunnels | Wormholes and Spacetime Tunnels]]
*   **Theoretical Acceptance** A few years ago, [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | wormholes]] were considered purely theoretical objects, possibly existing but beyond human reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Today, [[physics_of_fasterthanlight_travel | physicists]] are more theoretically willing to accept that travel using [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | space-time tunnels]] might be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Connection to [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | Quantum Entanglement]]** A [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | space-time tunnel]] formed from the merger of two black holes would require these black holes to be completely [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | entangled]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | Entanglement]] is an inexplicable phenomenon where two particles behave consistently; if one changes its quantum state, the other will also change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. In laboratory conditions, particles must interact for [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | entanglement]] to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Stability and Challenges** Historically, [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | space-time tunnels]] were believed to be unstable, making passage impossible due to disruptions of time and space inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. However, recent progress in the [[quantum_physics_and_its_impact_on_ultrafast_processes | quantum theory of the gravitational field]] suggests that with the right amount of information, the stability of [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | entangled]] black holes could be maintained for passage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Exiting from the other side remains beyond current civilization's technical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### [[Potential of universal quantum computers | Quantum Computers]]
[[potential_of_universal_quantum_computers | Quantum computers]] utilize the phenomenon of [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | entanglement]] for error correction in experiments and theoretical models of [[quantum_physics_and_its_impact_on_ultrafast_processes | quantum field theory]] and gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This practical implementation of [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | entanglement]] serves as an experimental testing ground before dreaming of traveling through [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | space-time tunnels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Conclusion
While exceeding the speed of light for physical objects remains elusive, the expansion of space itself and the theoretical possibilities offered by [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | wormholes]] and [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | quantum entanglement]] continue to be areas of active scientific inquiry. The progress in [[quantum_physics_and_its_impact_on_ultrafast_processes | quantum theory]] and the development of [[potential_of_universal_quantum_computers | quantum computing]] hint at potential future breakthroughs, even if direct FTL travel remains a distant dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

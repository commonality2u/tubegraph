Polish physicist Micha≈Ç Parniak has achieved states in [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications|quantum physics]] previously unmanaged, including the creation of a record-breaking [[quantum_computing_technologies|quantum memory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This memory can store many photons simultaneously, hold them, and even perform [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology|quantum operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Quantum Memory as a Processor

The quantum memory, developed starting around 2011, is a cloud of atoms in a vacuum capable of absorbing light, specifically weak, single photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. It is capable of remembering and storing numerous photons at once, and potentially processing them by performing specific [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology|quantum operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This makes it a type of [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology|quantum processor]] designed for specific tasks on light, useful in fields like [[quantum_metrology_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology|quantum metrology]] and [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology|quantum communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. The memory achieved record-breaking capacity, capable of storing the most photons, a record still largely held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

More recently, this memory has been advanced to not just store and reproduce photons, but to process the information within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. Its specific task is to extract spectral information from photons, determining the precise spectral lines they consist of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. These spectral lines serve as "imprints" of molecules, for instance, from an atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. This enables the device to very precisely distinguish between closely spaced spectral lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

## Quantum Metrology and Measurement Limits

[[quantum_properties_and_their_applications|Quantum measurements]] constitute a highly practical field known as metrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>. It is considered one of the most promising areas, potentially even more so than [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology|quantum computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. [[quantum_metrology_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology|Quantum metrology]] involves constructing systems for measurement and using [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications|quantum mechanics]] principles to minimize [[impact_of_observation_in_quantum_mechanics|quantum noise]], thereby improving measurement precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>. This technique is often referred to as "squeezing," which involves reducing light fluctuations by allowing them to increase where they are less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>.

Experiments in [[quantum_metrology_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology|quantum metrology]] are already being applied in practical measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.

### Gravitational Wave Detectors

Gravitational wave detectors operating in the United States, Italy, and Japan utilize [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications|quantum light engineering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. This technology, developed by [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications|quantum physicists]], has approximately doubled the precision of gravitational wave measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.

### Position Measurement

[[quantum_metrology_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology|Quantum metrology]] is also useful for measuring position, such as the position of mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>. Challenges arise because light itself has [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications|quantum fluctuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. Increasing the amount of light makes it more classical, but also risks disturbing the mirrors due to photon pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>. There is an optimum balance, and [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications|quantum mechanics]] tricks can improve this optimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>. All measurements face their own [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications|quantum limits]], which are determined by the fluctuations of both the measuring tool and the object being measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>.

## Information Encoding and Decoding

The light spectrum offers two main applications: chemical research and studying molecular composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>. Another significant application is the potential to better "pack" the degree of freedom of light to encode and decode information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>. Better utilization of spectral degrees of freedom is crucial for telecommunications, especially for long-distance optical fibers like those under the Atlantic, where increasing transmission by a factor of 10 would be immensely valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[19:25:00]</a>.

Researchers are working to invent protocols for better decoding information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. While we understand how to use photons' features to encode information, the question of how to encode it more densely is an interesting field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>. The use of microwave photons for this purpose is also being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. Photons are considered excellent "workhorses" for [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications|quantum information]] due to the ability to control them well and conduct experiments that push the boundaries of understanding how [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications|quantum information]] operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>. Understanding the structure of [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications|quantum information]] brings us closer to comprehending how quanta work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>.

Current limits of information encoding with photons in visible light include using the light's polarization (associated with the photon's spin) or its temporal degree of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>. For example, a single photon in a state of superposition can exist in either of two light pulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>.

### Super-resolution and Astronomical Imaging

These studies aim to create devices with even greater "super-resolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:00">[23:42:00]</a>. Experiments are extending the application of these protocols from infrared light to other wavelengths, working towards a more universal device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>.

In astronomy, the famous image of a black hole, for instance, is not a single photo but a visualization created from many superimposed images collected by microwave detectors across the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a>. To image such small objects, a huge telescope is needed, effectively using the entire Earth as a lens, though with limited "pixels" or coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>. The same principles can be applied in the optical domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:18:00">[25:18:00]</a>. Research is ongoing to use devices that work with atoms and microwave light to perform more precise microwave measurements or gain new information from single photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:00">[25:29:00]</a>. This could potentially lead to a more accurate image of a black hole's event horizon using microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:00">[25:46:00]</a>. Placing such detectors in space could further increase the "lens" size to that of the entire solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>.

Beyond black holes, microwaves can also provide information about the cosmic microwave background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:00">[26:16:00]</a>. This radiation, a remnant of the Big Bang, contains fluctuations from which many features of the universe can be predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:23:00">[26:23:00]</a>. It is not generated by celestial bodies but is omnipresent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:00">[26:45:00]</a>. While not exclusively [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications|quantum physics]], the goal is to measure these microwaves more precisely, motivated by the desire to understand the universe and improve communication technologies like 5G and 6G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>.

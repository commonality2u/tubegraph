The relationship between [[quantum physics and consciousness | quantum physics]] and consciousness presents some of the most profound and intriguing questions in modern science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Researchers are pushing the boundaries of [[quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum theory]] to understand how fundamental principles, such as randomness at the particle level, give rise to the ordered, macroscopic world we perceive, and ultimately, to consciousness itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## The Observer Effect and Human Consciousness

One area of discussion in [[quantum mechanics and consciousness | quantum mechanics]] is the "observer effect," which raises questions about the role of an observer in influencing experimental outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:27">[02:39:27]</a>.

### The Physicist's Perspective
From the perspective of an experimental physicist, human consciousness, as currently understood in natural sciences, has "absolutely no significance" on the results of an experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:17">[02:27:17]</a>. If an experiment is set up with only detectors and computers, the presence or absence of a conscious observer does not change the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:20">[02:27:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:30">[02:27:30]</a>.

However, for an observer to "see" something, photons are required, and these photons can indeed disturb the measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:35">[02:37:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:39">[02:47:39]</a>. The role of an observer in [[impact of observation in quantum mechanics | quantum physics]] is linked to the transition from the quantum to the classical limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:54">[02:57:54]</a>. The observer, whether an automaton or a conscious being, "intersects the path of possibilities" for further quantum interference, causing a probabilistic outcome (e.g., a photon hitting one detector or another) to become realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:01">[02:58:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:08">[02:58:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:22">[02:58:22]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Quantum to Classical Transition
> One of the most interesting issues in modern physics is how the transition occurs from the probabilistic, superposition-rich [[the_role_of_quantum_mechanics_in_understanding_consciousness | quantum world]] to the deterministic [[consciousness_beyond_the_quantum_level | classical world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This phenomenon is addressed by the theory of decoherence, a field of study that explains how quantum systems lose their quantum properties and begin to behave classically when they interact with their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

## The Nature of Consciousness

The emergence of consciousness from physical processes remains a profound mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:42">[04:22:42]</a>. The "subjective observer" who wakes up in the morning and realizes their existence is an "amazing" and "incredible" phenomenon that cannot yet be explained by current scientific understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:49">[04:42:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:13">[04:43:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:16">[04:43:16]</a>. While we understand how ordinary and even quantum computers work, there is "absolutely no idea" how consciousness arises from the logical actions of neural networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:21">[04:43:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:30">[04:43:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:38">[04:43:38]</a>.

### Quantum Effects in the Brain?
Some theories, like those proposed by Professor Roger Penrose, suggest that [[quantum mechanics and consciousness | quantum effects]] at the level of microtubules in the human brain might be involved in consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:42">[04:43:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:45">[04:43:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:49">[04:43:49]</a>. However, this is still seen as a "mechanistic description" that uses quantum language rather than classical, but does not fundamentally solve the problem of subjective experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:52">[04:43:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:53">[04:43:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:56">[04:43:56]</a>.

The idea of consciousness operating at the level of elementary particles that react on a macro scale, potentially leading to telepathic influence between brains, is a "not very romantic" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:35">[04:44:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. From a scientific standpoint, the standard model, which provides a physical, mechanistic description of reality, is a "necessary condition for consciousness to exist," but it is unknown if it is "sufficient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:03">[04:45:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:06">[04:45:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:12">[04:45:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:17">[04:45:17]</a>.

## Cognitive Accessibility and Limitations

A key question is whether all problems, including the nature of consciousness, are "cognitively accessible" to humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:30">[04:29:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:33">[04:29:33]</a>. Human understanding is correlated with three-dimensional reality and the perception of time, which sets a certain perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:12">[04:29:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:15">[04:29:15]</a>. While humans have a great ability for abstract thinking, the question of whether our brains, with their inherent limitations, can fully comprehend consciousness might be "poorly posed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:47">[04:28:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:54">[04:28:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:35">[04:29:35]</a>.

It is possible that a part of nature is "not cognitively accessible" to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:50">[04:50:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:52">[04:52:52]</a>. However, scientists are committed to conducting cognition based on "well-posed questions" that can be confronted with reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:10">[04:44:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:53">[04:51:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:56">[04:51:56]</a>. Questions that cannot be tested against reality are considered "wrongly posed" because there is no mechanism to decide the sensibility of any answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:57">[04:54:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:01">[04:55:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:03">[04:55:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:07">[04:56:07]</a>.

## Open Questions

The most fundamental question in physics, if a scientist could choose only one, would be "whether and if so how [[consciousness and its emergence from physical processes | consciousness results from the standard model]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:32">[04:42:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:37">[04:42:37]</a>. This highlights the ongoing scientific quest to understand the underlying principles that give rise to our subjective experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:46">[04:42:46]</a>.

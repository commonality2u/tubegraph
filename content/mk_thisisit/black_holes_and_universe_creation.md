Physicist Nikodem Popławski's ideas regarding [[black_holes_and_universe_creation_theory | black holes creating new universes]] have garnered significant attention, being named one of the top 10 most important ideas of the year by National Geographic and Science magazine. Morgan Freeman even referred to him as the "second Copernicus," and his paper on [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole research]] remains highly cited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Fundamental Theory: Classical Space-Time and Quantized Matter

Popławski asserts that there will be no quantum theory of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He believes that space-time is fundamentally classical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, and that there are no gravitons acting as carriers of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Instead, the curvature of space-time itself *is* gravity, and this curvature is a fundamental aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Within this classical space-time, matter is quantized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

The idea that space-time is fundamentally classical contrasts with theories of quantum gravity that propose gravitons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Popławski argues that if space-time were flat, then gravitons would cause it to be effectively curved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. However, he questions how [[black_holes_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | black holes]] could originate from fundamentally flat space-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For him, the flatness and curvature of space-time *are* gravity, with curvature being a fundamental property rather than an effect of averaged gravitons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Matter, such as quarks and leptons, and the carriers of other fundamental forces (electromagnetism, weak, and strong forces – collectively electroweak and strong forces) interact quantumly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This quantum interaction occurs within a curved, classical space-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### The De Broglie-Bohm Theory

Popławski supports the De Broglie-Bohm theory, also known as the pilot wave hypothesis of Quantum Mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This interpretation posits that the wave function always exists as a solution to equations like Dirac's or Schrödinger's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Particles are not in multiple places simultaneously; they exist at a single point and are "piloted" by these quantum waves, much like surfers on ocean waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. In this view, there is no "collapse of the wave function"; the wave function simply guides the particle's movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

This hypothesis explains phenomena like the double-slit experiment, where interference patterns are observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The theory suggests that a tiny initial change in a particle's condition can lead to a large, chaotic change in its final position due to the guiding wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Since initial conditions cannot be measured with absolute precision, the outcome becomes probabilistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Black Holes and the Creation of New Universes

Popławski's most significant scientific contribution is his theory that every [[black_holes_and_universe_creation_theory | black hole creates a new universe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This concept relies on the twisting of space-time, which removes [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularities]] and allows the black hole to facilitate the creation of a new universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

### The Role of Space-Time Torsion and the Big Bounce

Instead of a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]], where matter collapses to an infinite density, Popławski proposes a "big bounce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. At extremely high densities, such as those found near [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularities]] or the [[the_expansion_of_the_universe_and_the_Big_Bang_theory | Big Bang]], space-time torsion (a twist) becomes very strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This torsion acts like repulsive gravity, preventing the formation of a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]] and causing the matter to stop and bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Because this matter cannot escape the event horizon, it expands into a new universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

This twist of space-time is nearly zero at lower densities (like on Earth or in neutron stars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>, meaning it does not alter general relativity in typical conditions. However, at densities vastly exceeding those of neutron stars (e.g., 10^45 g/m³), the torsion becomes significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

### Mass Increase and Cycles of Expansion

A key challenge is explaining how a new universe, vastly more massive than a black hole, can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Popławski's theory addresses this through the quantum production of particle-antiparticle pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. When matter collapses into a very hot, dense state, gravity, motion, and quantum theory lead to an analogue of [[black_holes_wormholes_and_the_information_paradox | Hawking radiation]], producing vast amounts of new matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. This new matter increases the total mass within the black hole, which then expands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

According to Friedmann equations, this newly formed cosmos is a closed space and will not expand indefinitely. It will eventually stop and contract for another bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Each bounce creates new matter, leading to progressively larger expansion cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Inflation and the Cosmological Constant

Popławski proposes that after several such bounces, the cosmos could become so large that the [[dark_matter_and_universe_composition | cosmological constant]] becomes dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This constant, acting as [[dark_matter_and_universe_composition | dark energy]], causes space to expand at an accelerating rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Its force is proportional to the universe's volume, so a larger universe experiences a stronger effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Eventually, the cosmos could become large enough that this cosmological constant prevents it from contracting again, leading to infinite expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

His model also addresses the inflation theory, which explains problems like the horizon, flatness, and structure problems of the universe (e.g., the distribution of galaxy superclusters and voids) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Inflation, an exponential expansion of the universe, quickly blew up microscopic quantum fluctuations to large scales, resulting in the observed structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. While most astrophysicists accept inflation due to cosmic microwave background radiation measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, the question remains what *caused* inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

Popławski's research, published in 2016 and 2021, demonstrates that combining space-time torsion with the quantum production of particle-antiparticle pairs naturally leads to inflation immediately after the big bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. This model provides a natural explanation for inflation without resorting to hypothetical scalar fields or inflatons, which are often used in other theories and require two parameters that are not derived from fundamental physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. Furthermore, his model predicts that inflation lasts for a short, finite time, which aligns with observations that the universe is no longer expanding exponentially and has allowed for star formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. The end of inflation occurs because the space-time twist becomes unimportant at lower densities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Popławski's theory suggests that the twist of space-time and the quantum production of particle-antiparticle pairs together not only remove the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]] but also naturally create inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This offers a unified explanation for the early universe's expansion without relying on additional hypothetical fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

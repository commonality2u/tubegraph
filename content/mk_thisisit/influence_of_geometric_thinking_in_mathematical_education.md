Mathematical understanding varies significantly among individuals, with a notable division between those who prefer [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visual images]] and those who favor a more [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | abstract]] or algebraic approach to understanding [[mathematical_interpretations_of_geometric_principles | mathematical concepts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Personal Experience with Visual Thinking
The speaker notes that they personally find it easier to understand things [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visually]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visual thinking]] process is central to their approach when contemplating [[mathematical_interpretations_of_geometric_principles | mathematics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. While at school, the speaker observed that their way of thinking was different from most peers, as they understood concepts others did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. At university, studying [[mathematical_interpretations_of_geometric_principles | mathematics]], they initially assumed others thought similarly but discovered a wide array of thinking styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. A key distinction was between [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visual]] and non-visual thinkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The speaker, a [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visual thinker]], found themselves in the minority, with only three out of fifteen students in their year thinking [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visually]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Despite being a minority, this [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visual way of thinking]] was advantageous for the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Systemic Bias Against Geometric Thinking
There is a perceived [[mathematics_as_a_tool_versus_a_divisive_force | systemic prejudice]] against mathematicians who excel at [[geometry_and_spacetime | geometric thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The speaker argues that the examination process is harder for [[geometry_and_spacetime | geometric thinkers]] compared to those with non-[[geometry_and_spacetime | geometric thinking]] styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. This means individuals who can think in a more direct, verbal way, rather than [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visually]], tend to perform better in exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

### Examination Challenges for Visual Thinkers
When the speaker specialized in subjects like projective [[geometry_and_spacetime | geometry]] and algebraic [[geometry_and_spacetime | geometry]], which are highly [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visual]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, they achieved the highest grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. However, their best performance was unexpectedly in algebra, not [[geometry_and_spacetime | geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

The speaker hypothesizes that this is due to the translation process required for [[geometry_and_spacetime | geometric thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>:
*   **Algebra:** Problems can be solved and written down directly, seemingly engaging a single mental process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
*   **[[geometry_and_spacetime | Geometry]]:** While understanding might be immediate for a [[geometry_and_spacetime | geometric thinker]], translating the solution into written words for an exam introduces an additional step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. This translation process slows down [[geometry_and_spacetime | geometric thinkers]], putting them at a disadvantage in timed exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. In contrast, algebraic solutions could be written down immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

## Teaching and Student Preferences
As a lecturer, the speaker observed that students did not enthusiastically receive explanations presented [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visually]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. Students preferred formulas that could be written down and manipulated, reflecting their preferred mode of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. This suggests that the entrance tests for universities might be structured in a way that disproportionately affects [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visual thinkers]], leading to a student body that thinks more verbally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

## Complexity of Dimensions
The idea that human understanding is limited by the [[geometry_and_spacetime | three-dimensionality]] of the brain is addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. However, [[mathematical_interpretations_of_geometric_principles | mathematics]] used in quantum mechanics often deals with schemes that are not [[geometry_and_spacetime | three-dimensional]], extending to n-dimensional or even infinite dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. While [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visual thinking]] can be limiting in these contexts, it is still possible to think in ways that are not purely [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visual]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

For instance, special relativity, described [[geometry_and_spacetime | geometrically]] by Minkowski, is a [[geometry_and_spacetime | four-dimensional geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. While the speaker personally prefers to use [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visual tricks]] to conceptualize [[geometry_and_spacetime | four-dimensional]] concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, it is understood that such [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | images]] are often imprecise when applied to non-Euclidean [[geometry_and_spacetime | geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. [[geometry_and_spacetime | Spacetime]] ([[geometry_and_spacetime | four-dimensional]]) cannot be conceived as [[geometry_and_spacetime | Euclidean three-dimensional space]] due to the differing character of the time dimension compared to spatial dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

Ultimately, while the brain's structure may influence how individuals grasp [[mathematical_interpretations_of_geometric_principles | mathematical truths]], it doesn't preclude understanding higher dimensions or [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | abstract concepts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

The standard general theory of [[black_holes_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | relativity]] predicts that when a black hole event horizon forms, the matter inside collapses to a point called a [[singularities_and_gravitational_collapse | singularity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. At this point, the density of matter and the curvature of [[classical_spacetime_and_gravity | space-time]] become infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This is considered the biggest problem of the general theory of [[black_holes_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | relativity]], as infinite quantities do not exist physically and cannot be measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The presence of infinity indicates that the theory is incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Popławski's Alternative to Singularities

Physicist Nikodem Popławski proposes an alternative to the traditional concept of [[singularities_and_gravitational_collapse | singularities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. In his view, matter does not collapse to a [[singularities_and_gravitational_collapse | singularity]] but rather collapses to a state of very high density, then stops, and begins to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This expanding matter cannot return to its origin or go beyond the black hole's event horizon because movement through it is one-way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Since [[classical_spacetime_and_gravity | space-time]] inside a black hole is not static according to [[black_holes_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's equations]], the matter has no choice but to expand into a new space, which is interpreted as a new expanding universe on the other side of the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Popławski's concept suggests that every black hole, instead of creating a [[singularities_and_gravitational_collapse | singularity]], creates an Einstein-Rosen bridge (a [[classical_spacetime_and_gravity | space-time]] wormhole) to a new universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Role of Spacetime Torsion

The mechanism that prevents the formation of [[singularities_and_gravitational_collapse | singularities]] in Popławski's model is the "twisting of [[classical_spacetime_and_gravity | space-time]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This concept is based on Cartan's theory, an older generalization of the general theory of [[black_holes_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | relativity]] developed in 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. While normally assumed to be zero, allowing this torsion to be derived reveals that it becomes very strong at extremely high densities, such as those near a [[singularities_and_gravitational_collapse | singularity]] or the Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>. At these densities (around 10^45 kilograms per cubic meter, far denser than neutron stars at 10^17 kg/m^3), torsion acts as a repulsive force, preventing the [[singularities_and_gravitational_collapse | singularity]] and causing matter to "bounce" instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. This "Big Bounce" allows matter to expand into a new universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.

### Inflationary Expansion

Popławski's model further suggests that combining [[classical_spacetime_and_gravity | space-time]] torsion with the quantum production of particle-antiparticle pairs at high densities naturally explains the rapid, exponential expansion of the early universe known as inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. Unlike other inflation theories that require hypothetical scalar fields with multiple parameters, this model uses only one parameter, making it a more natural and less hypothetical explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>. This inflation is not eternal but naturally ends as the [[classical_spacetime_and_gravity | space-time]] twist becomes negligible at lower densities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>.

## Other Views on Singularities

Most scientists currently believe that black holes contain [[singularities_and_gravitational_collapse | singularities]], but they anticipate that a future [[relativity_and_quantum_gravity | quantum theory of gravity]] might offer a way to bypass them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. The [[relativity_and_quantum_gravity | quantum theory of gravity]], particularly the uncertainty principle, suggests that it might be impossible to precisely determine the position or momentum of [[classical_spacetime_and_gravity | space-time]] on an atomic scale. This imprecision could imply that a [[singularities_and_gravitational_collapse | singularity]] (a point or circle in rotating black holes) might not be infinitely dense or precisely localized, potentially resolving the problem of infinities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

The idea that [[classical_spacetime_and_gravity | space-time]] itself is fundamentally classical, rather than quantized with gravitons, is also proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. In this view, the curvature of [[classical_spacetime_and_gravity | space-time]] is a fundamental aspect, not an averaged effect of gravitons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. Matter, however, is quantized and interacts through other quantum forces (electromagnetism, weak, and strong interactions) within this curved classical [[classical_spacetime_and_gravity | space-time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.

## Scientific Recognition

Popławski's concept of black holes creating new universes was recognized by National Geographic and *Science* magazine as one of the most important scientific concepts of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>. His article describing this idea became one of the most frequently cited in the history of Science News <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. Morgan Freeman, in his "Curiosity" program, referred to Popławski as the "second Copernicus," and the scientific search engine *Scipro* indicated him as [[einstein_special_relativity_and_mathematical_visualization | Einstein's successor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The theory is taken seriously by science, with Stephen Hawking having considered the possibility of black holes and new universes in an essay in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

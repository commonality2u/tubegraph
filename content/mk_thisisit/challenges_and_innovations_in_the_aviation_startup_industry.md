The enduring human dream of flight, characterized by floating freely and experiencing speed and freedom, has always fascinated people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This aspiration drives companies like Jetson, which aims to become the "Tesla of flying cars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Their mission is to transfer movement from the ground to the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Visionary Behind Jetson

Tomek, the creator of the world's first fast flying personal vehicle, describes himself as a designer, visionary, futurist, and entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. He is driven by a passion for creating things that bring joy, are fast, and fly, particularly ambitious projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Tomek considers his work a pleasure rather than a job, often working from sunrise, fueled by a desire to "do cool things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

The Jetson product has gained significant recognition, even being recognized by an official at passport control in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. When traveling, the vehicle consistently attracts attention, with many people already knowing about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Genesis of a Flying Vehicle

### Early Concepts and Inspirations
The idea for Jetson wasn't a single "aha" moment but rather a culmination of years of working with flying devices like drones and remote-controlled helicopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. As cameras and cargo demands grew, it became clear that personal flight was a natural progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Tomek had sketched ideas for personal electric helicopters made of carbon fiber since his architecture studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Films depicting groups of kids building things together also served as an inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### First Prototypes and Flights
The first prototype was created in Italy in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. It was built rapidly within two weeks from a notebook sketch, using simple aluminum profiles and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Initial unmanned flights with ballast led to the crucial moment of the first manned flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Tomek himself was the pilot for this maiden flight in Pontedera, Italy, describing it as an "amazing experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry | Challenges]] and Overcoming Hurdles

### Overcoming Obstacles
The journey of building Jetson wasn't without its [[challenges_of_entrepreneurship_and_innovation_in_Poland | challenges]]. Tomek states that the most difficult issues were "typical [[startups_and_entrepreneurship_in_technology | startup]] problems" and "ego problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. For months, he lived in the factory building, which was initially neglected and lacked air conditioning, highlighting the dedication required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

### Manufacturing with Modern Tools
The Jetson team leverages technology like 3D printers for production parts, overcoming initial reluctance some might have about using them for such critical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This approach allows for rapid iteration, enabling daily changes to parts and quick testing of new designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This contrasts with the traditional setting of an old silk factory where the production takes place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Strategic Locations for Development

The initial location in Tuscany, Italy, was chosen for its available space and good weather, allowing for year-round testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. This facility serves as Jetson's base for Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

Given that 70% of Jetson's clients are in the United States, the company is actively seeking a suitable location there, particularly in the Mojave Desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. The desert's low humidity and stable weather make it an ideal environment for testing and fostering aviation [[innovation_and_entrepreneurship_in_aviation_technologies | innovation]] year-round, echoing its historical role as a cradle of aviation in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

## Jetson One: Design, Features, and User Experience

The latest version of Jetson features new, more powerful engines and lighter, more durable, and optimized carbon fiber arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. These arms, produced by a company that makes elements for supercars, utilize carbon fiber's ability to be optimized for specific directions, leading to very light yet durable components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

### Controls and Safety
The Jetson is designed for simplicity, making it accessible even to those accustomed to driving a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Control is managed via a single four-axis joystick:
*   **Altitude control:** Pushing up for higher flight, pulling down to lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Directional control:** Tilting forward for forward flight, backward for reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Take-off:** A slight upward push initiates automatic take-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **Hover:** Releasing the joystick causes the Jetson to hang in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

A red button activates an automatic landing system, using a radar to detect the ceiling and land the vehicle without pilot input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Manual landing is also an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. The design philosophy is to simplify complex tasks for the pilot, making flight training less extensive than for traditional aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

A simulator, with software developed in Gdynia, Poland, is used for training, emphasizing "muscle memory" despite the vehicle's simple controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### Performance and Weather Resistance
The Jetson One's maximum speed is 102 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. However, for safety at lower altitudes, the speed is limited to 60 km/h, only allowing full speed when higher up where a parachute can be deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

The vehicle is designed to be weather-resistant, capable of standing outside and even flying in light rain, a challenging feat due to its delicate components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

### Safety Features
The on-screen display provides critical information such as battery level, speed, and altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>. The system also notifies the pilot of critical issues, such as overheating engines or batteries, advising less aggressive flight or landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. If the Jetson completely overheats, it initiates an automatic, uncancelable landing with a countdown, though the pilot can still control the tilt to choose a landing spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. A ballistic parachute can also be launched via a handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

## Market Position and Regulatory Landscape

From its conceptualization in 2017/2018, Jetson's development in just a few years is considered rapid for the aviation sector, which typically implements changes over many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. The founder emphasizes approaching development with a fresh perspective, not merely copying existing standards but experimenting and not fearing failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

Initially, there were dozens of companies in the Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (EVTOL) space, growing to about 250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. However, this number is "dramatically decreasing," as many projects remain visualizations or prototypes and do not reach the sales phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. Jetson is one of only two companies currently selling such products on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

Jetson has already received certification as an ultralight flying vehicle in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. By the end of the year, Jetson expects to have its own unique classification and category, which will open doors for sales and operation across all European Union countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. Deliveries to customers are set to begin at the end of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.

## Future of [[development_and_future_of_urban_air_mobility | Urban Air Mobility]] and Beyond

### Expanding the Jetson Line
The immediate future for Jetson involves expanding its product line. This includes plans for:
*   A two-person Jetson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   A two-person Jetson with an exclusive, closed cockpit for commuting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.
*   Future models like Jetson One Plus, Jetson 2, and Jetson 3, each adding new capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

The overarching mission remains consistent: to transfer movement from the ground to the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.

### Beyond Flying Cars: Space Exploration
Looking beyond personal flying vehicles, Tomek has ambitions in the space industry, expressing a desire to build rockets and lead a company that excels in that field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. He compares this ambitious goal to the initial perception of creating a flying vehicle seven years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. This passion for space exploration drives him to consistently seek out the moon and reinforce his aspiration to either travel there or build a vehicle capable of approaching it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

## The Role of the United States in Aviation [[innovation_and_entrepreneurship_in_aviation_technologies | Innovation]]
The natural direction for Jetson's development and expansion is the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. This is attributed to a different mindset where people are more willing to take risks and are not afraid of moving to new places for opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. The US is seen as the ideal place for Jetson and other companies to develop and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

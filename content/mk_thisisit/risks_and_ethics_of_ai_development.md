Artificial intelligence (AI) is projected to reach superintelligence within 5 to 20 years, making it one of the most, if not the most, powerful technologies humanity has ever created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Both Professor Jeff Hinton, known as the father of neural networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, and Demis Hasab, co-founder of DeepMind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, firmly believe that achieving superintelligence is possible and not merely a marketing tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The rapid pace of recent advancements suggests this will occur sooner than previously anticipated, possibly within 5 to 20 years, with Demis Hasab suggesting around 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Addressing Risks and Control
Given AI's immense power, it is crucial to seriously consider the [[potential_threats_and_regulation_of_ai | risks associated with it]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Professor Hinton expressed regret for not contemplating the security issues earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. There is an urgent need to research how to maintain control over such systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This is not solely a technological [[challenges_and_ethical_considerations_in_ai_development | challenge]], but also a societal question about how AI systems should be used and made accessible to all humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Dual Nature of AI
While AI holds potential for significant scientific discoveries, such as in treating diseases, addressing energy crises, and tackling climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, its powerful nature also carries inherent risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Regulation and [[Regulation and ethical considerations in AI | Ethical Considerations in AI]]
The discussion extends to whether regulation can halt AI development, particularly amidst the pervasive interests of big tech corporations focused on profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. A significant concern lies with autonomous lethal weapons, which European regulations do not cover for military applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Governments are unwilling to restrict themselves in military AI, leading to an arms race among nations like the United States, China, Russia, and the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

AI requires appropriate [[regulation_and_control_of_ai_technologies | regulation]], but the challenge lies in the rapid evolution of the technology, which quickly renders past discussions obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Governments and social organizations are advised to develop flexible regulations, possibly based on existing frameworks in healthcare or transport, and adapt them dynamically to technological advancements <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Preventing Discrimination and Ensuring Accessibility
A key [[ethical_considerations_in_ai_development | ethical challenge]] is ensuring AI does not discriminate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. DeepMind's approach involves making its tools and activities open source or easily accessible, promoting the democratization and rapid spread of AI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## AI in Scientific Discovery
AI functions as a powerful tool, comparable to a new type of microscope, offering fresh perspectives on reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. It is increasingly becoming a key, or even main, element of scientific research, although Nobel Prizes will continue to be awarded for discoveries made, not merely for the use of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The success of advanced deep learning methods, like those used for protein structure prediction, relies heavily on vast, well-prepared experimental data sets, underscoring the crucial role of data alongside methodologies in AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The availability of rich and detailed datasets will be critical for AI's broader application in other scientific fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Recognition of AI's Influence
The Nobel Prize committee has acknowledged the immense influence of AI across various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. While technology provides the tools, human intuition and passion drive the identification and solution of problems, such as climate change or disease treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. The recent awarding of Nobel Prizes to creators of AI systems like AlphaFold, despite their research being recent, signifies a shift in how scientific achievements are recognized, highlighting the rapid impact of AI on humanity's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

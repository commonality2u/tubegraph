Robert Oppenheimer, a renowned physicist, contributed to the understanding of [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black holes]] with an article detailing a theoretical process for their formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.

## Dust Collapse
Oppenheimer's theory is based on the concept of "dust collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. In this model, "dust" refers to material without pressure, meaning nothing will stop the collapse process once it begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. This collapse is depicted as exactly spherically symmetrical, like a ball, with everything falling towards the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

## Formation of a Singularity
As particles fall towards the center without being stopped by pressure, they create what is known as a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. This [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]] is characterized by infinite density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. This "image" of Oppenheimer and Snyder (referring to his collaborator) describes matter collapsing into what is now called a [[understanding_black_holes_and_their_role_in_the_universe | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

## Trap Surface
Oppenheimer also defined the concept of a "trap surface" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. This inward-collapsing surface, even if irregular, possesses a specific criterion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. If this criterion is met, mathematical principles demonstrate that the formation of a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]] becomes unavoidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.

## Cosmic Censor Hypothesis
The concept of singularities within [[understanding_black_holes_and_their_role_in_the_universe | black holes]] is linked to the "cosmic censor hypothesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. This hypothesis suggests that all singularities must be hidden inside the [[event_horizon_and_hawking_radiation | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. Essentially, a "cosmic censor" prevents insight into the true nature of [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>. However, whether a horizon must always surround a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]] remains an open and mathematically challenging problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.

If [[understanding_black_holes_and_their_role_in_the_universe | black holes]] are fully understood, it would represent a significant advancement in theoretical physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>.

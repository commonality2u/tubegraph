The study of [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] offers profound insights into the fundamental nature of the universe, space, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:46">[02:01:46]</a>. Understanding them is considered a unique and significant challenge in physics, potentially leading to vast progress in comprehending the workings of space and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## Inside a Black Hole: Information and Singularity

### The Event Horizon
A [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] possesses an edge known as the horizon, which separates its interior from its exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Anything that crosses this horizon cannot escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. From the perspective of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, if an object falls into a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]], it has no chance of escaping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. While the object itself is inside the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]], an observer outside would perceive the situation differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

### The Phenomenon of Spaghettification
For a very large [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]], the initial fall might not feel extraordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. For example, falling into the supermassive [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] in galaxy M87, which has a mass of millions of solar masses, would allow about a day before meeting an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. This end involves being stretched and ultimately torn apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. The scale of a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] determines the experience; more massive [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black holes]] have larger sizes and weaker gravity at their horizon, which may seem counterintuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. In contrast, a hypothetical [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] with Earth's mass, if squeezed to the size of a pebble, would exert incredibly strong surface gravity that would flatten an object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. These properties are predicted by Einstein's [[general_relativity_and_singularities | general theory of relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

### The [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | Singularity]] and Information Loss
The process of falling into a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] leads to what is known as the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. The [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]] is not a physical place or its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. Rather, it is a moment in time where space disappears, and all atoms of an object cease to exist in a fundamental sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. This constitutes a complete erasure of information according to Einstein's theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. For anything falling into a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]], the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]] marks the end of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

> [!Note] The Information Paradox
> Despite Einstein's theory suggesting complete information erasure, recent research on [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] indicates that information might, after all, return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. This concept is central to the [[black_holes_and_information_paradox | information paradox]].

## The Nature of Time and Space

### Time as a Non-Absolute Entity
In Einstein's theory, time is not absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. It can end for an individual falling into a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]], even as it continues to flow for observers outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. The universe can be viewed as a set of events connected by cause-and-effect relationships, where time is not necessarily at the absolute center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. The critical aspect is the causal link between events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

### Space as a Constructed Phenomenon
The idea that space itself might be "made of something" is explored, suggesting it is a product of something more fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. This implies the existence of objects that interact but do not exist in space themselves; rather, their interactions result in what we perceive as space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. Our common understanding of space, involving distance and location, may be an emergent property of more elementary, fundamental interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.

## [[black_holes_wormholes_and_the_information_paradox | Black Holes]] as Gateways to Other Universes

While the [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] known to exist are formed from collapsing stars and do not act as portals to other universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>, mathematical equations describing [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] do allow for such a scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

### The Kerr Solution
The Kerr solution, a mathematical description of a spinning [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]], derived from Einstein's equations, allows for a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]] that can be "jumped through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>. This solution suggests a possibility of appearing in an infinite universe on the other side, and even potentially jumping through another [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]] into yet another universe, creating an "infinite tower of nested universes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. Each of these universes would be infinitely large and contained within another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>.

This "crazy" configuration, while a perfectly consistent mathematical solution to Einstein's equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>, does not concern the world we live in because [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] formed from stellar collapse block any possibility of crossing to "the other side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>. The Schwarzschild solution, calculated by Karl Schwarzschild in 1915 shortly after Einstein formulated his equations, describes the non-spinning [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>.

## The Universe as a Quantum Computer

Recent scientific research, particularly in understanding how information operates within [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]], suggests that space might be constructed similarly to a giant quantum computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>.

This idea stems from the notion that the fundamental "things" that make up space behave very much like qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>. It's as if nature has long understood how quantum computers work, and humans are only now learning the tricks used to build reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>. Nature is fundamentally quantum mechanical, and everything around us likely reflects quantum principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:46:00">[23:46:00]</a>. The question of whether human consciousness itself is quantum is an area of modern research, with some scientists suggesting the brain might function on fundamentally quantum microtubules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>.

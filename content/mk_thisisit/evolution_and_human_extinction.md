A debate between Professor Andrzej Dragan, a physicist, and Jacek Dukaj, a futurologist, explored the nature of humanity, artificial intelligence, and life itself, under the title "The End of Man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. The discussion touched upon the trajectory of human evolution and the potential for its end or transformation due to technological advancements.

## The End of Traditional Human Evolution

Jacek Dukaj posits that traditional evolution, as observed in animals, has de facto ended for *Homo sapiens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>. He argues that the cultural and technological pressures exerted by humans on their living conditions and biological structure have become more significant than natural evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>. This means the random exchange of genes through reproduction and the extinction of less-adapted gene carriers no longer function as the primary mechanism for human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>. The [[evolution_of_cultural_and_societal_norms | evolution of technology]] is now considered much stronger, faster, and has a greater impact, effectively taking over the "baton" of evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.

## Genetic Modification and the Future of Humanity

The conversation highlighted recent advancements in [[genetic_modification_and_the_future_of_humanity | human genome modification]]. The American Drug Administration, followed by the British, recently approved a therapeutic method involving strong interference with human DNA strands, specifically for sickle cell anemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. Dukaj believes it is "inevitable" that interference in the human genome will become so profound that humans will cease to be *Homo sapiens* in the traditional sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>. This directly relates to the [[ethical_and_evolutionary_implications_of_human_genome_modification | ethical and evolutionary implications of human genome modification]].

## Technological Singularity and Human Replacement

The concept of a [[the_singularity_and_its_impact_on_human_evolution | technological singularity]] was discussed as a moment when artificial intelligence (AI) will be able to improve itself exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. Dukaj acknowledges that predictions for this moment are very optimistic, with some suggesting two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. He views this prospect pessimistically, imagining a reality where humans are subordinate to non-human beings, no longer the highest form of intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. While some see it as the "expected arrival of God," others are "terrified" and try to delay the process, though Dukaj believes such methods are impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

Professor Dragan suggests that humans may not fly far into space for the same reason that we will be replaced by artificial minds: the technology for deep space travel is harder than creating artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. He predicts that humanity will learn to replicate the brain in silicon before achieving distant space travel, suggesting that by then, humans will have "long since left the meat stage behind us" and be replaced by creatures devoid of biological matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

> "so it is possible that before we reach such a technology that will allow us to modify our organisms, to change one meat into another, it will no longer be needed at all because there will be completely more effective ways, perhaps PR will be replaced by something else, there will be no more organisms anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>
> â€” Andrzej Dragan

### Inevitable Change
Dukaj concludes that the traditional [[impact_on_the_theory_of_human_evolution | evolution of *Homo sapiens*]] has ended, and there is "no return to it," unless a catastrophe occurs that reverts humanity to the Stone Age, restarting a "normal" *Homo sapiens* evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>. This highlights the profound and potentially irreversible [[future_technological_advancements_and_human_evolution | future technological advancements and human evolution]].

## Survival and Extinction
Dragan reminds the audience that survival for species is an "exception," and "extinction of rules" is the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>. This aligns with a principle of [[evolutionary_algorithms_and_natural_selection | natural selection]], suggesting that even if a species survives longer than others, it is ultimately a "temporary issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

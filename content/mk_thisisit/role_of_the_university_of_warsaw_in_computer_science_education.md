The University of Warsaw (UW) has established itself as a leading institution in the field of computer science, particularly in international programming competitions. Its long-standing commitment to nurturing talent and its demanding academic programs have contributed significantly to Poland's global reputation in computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## A Legacy of Leadership in Programming Competitions

The University of Warsaw has been a consistent leader in the International Olympiad in Information Technology (IOI), with many of its students reaching the finals over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. In the broader world ranking of universities in the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), UW holds the first position, surpassing renowned institutions like Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley, and Cambridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### The Origins of Success in ICPC

Professor Jan Madey, a professor at the University of Warsaw for 60 years, is credited with having the greatest influence on Poland's outstanding results in IT Olympiads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. In 1994, Professor Madey discovered a regional programming competition for students in Amsterdam, which served as a qualifier for the finals in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. He took three young students, whom he knew from their school days through the [[national_fund_for_children | National Fund for Children]], to this competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Against all odds, this initial University of Warsaw team won the regional competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

The following year, a Central Europe region was established for the competition, where Poland also achieved success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The team's participation in the 1996 finals in Philadelphia was particularly notable, coinciding with Garry Kasparov's first match against Deep Blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### The "Beverly Hills Scandal" of 2003

A pivotal moment occurred in 2003 when a University of Warsaw team competed in the ICPC finals in Beverly Hills. The team, focused and morally prepared for success, unexpectedly won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This victory shocked journalists, especially American media, who were surprised to see a team from Poland, then a less-recognized country in global technology, dominate the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. The win, described as a "scandal" in the United States, led to widespread news coverage and significant public recognition in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This event also marked the beginning of major Western companies showing interest in Poland for talent acquisition and establishing research and development centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

UW has won the world championship twice, achieving this by solving more tasks than any other team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.

### Why Poland Excels

Polish teams, particularly those from the University of Warsaw, excel in programming competitions because the tasks demand strong mathematical, algorithmic, and programming preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Success in these competitions requires the ability to think deeply, rather than just rapid coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This aptitude is often rooted in the traditional "Polish school of mathematics," which has a long history of excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

## The Educational Philosophy at the University of Warsaw

The computer science program at the University of Warsaw is known for being very difficult and demanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. A significant portion of its students, particularly in the later years of study, are Olympians in mathematics and computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

### Professor Madey's Influence on Curriculum

Professor Madey was instrumental in introducing Pascal as the primary programming language taught in Polish computer science studies, having authored influential textbooks that "taught Poles how to program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. These early languages, including ALGOL 60, emphasized algorithmic thinking over technicalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.

His unique "master's workshop" classes for third-year computer science students are particularly impactful. These classes invite successful individuals to share their experiences, including failures and mental health challenges, encouraging students to think beyond technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Students in these classes are required to write essays reflecting on their experiences, which are then shared (anonymously) with the guest speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.

## Broader Impact and Future Directions

While the University of Warsaw plays a leading role, other Polish universities like Jagiellonian University (UJ) and Wroc≈Çaw University also perform very well in programming competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. The success of Polish programmers is attributed to a combination of talented young people and effective, albeit sometimes few, teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

The success has spurred interest from Western companies in Poland, though the professor notes that a large percentage of graduates choose to stay in or return to Poland, rather than permanently leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. To maintain and enhance these achievements, Professor Madey emphasizes the need to invest more in teachers and in strong academic areas like IT and mathematics Olympiads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. These efforts aim to foster continued enthusiasm for learning among young, talented individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>.

Our universe may resemble a giant [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | quantum computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The latest scientific research, particularly through the study of black holes, suggests that space is constructed from fundamental elements that behave like qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. This perspective implies that nature long ago discovered how [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | quantum computers]] work, and we are only now learning these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

## Black Holes: A Key to Understanding the Universe

Black holes are not merely interesting astronomical objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>; understanding them presents a unique and huge challenge in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. By understanding black holes, significant progress can be made in comprehending how [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | space and time]] truly operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Information and the Singularity

When an object falls into a black hole, it is stretched to zero, and as space disappears, the object and all its atoms also disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This represents a complete erasure of information according to [[classical_spacetime_and_gravity | Einstein's theory of gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. However, recent research suggests that information can return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

The "singularity" of a black hole is not a specific place or its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Instead, it is the "end of [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | time]]" for anything that falls into a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. At this moment, according to Einstein's theory, we cease to exist in a very fundamental sense; our atoms are not destroyed or moved, but simply cease to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

> [!INFO] Gravitational Effects
> For a large black hole, the process of falling into it may not feel particularly extraordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For instance, falling into a supermassive black hole like M87 (millions of solar masses) would allow about a day before meeting an end due to being stretched and torn apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The more massive a black hole, the larger its size and the smaller the gravity on its horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## The Nature of Time

[[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Time]] is not an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. It is a very important idea and significant phenomenon, but it can *end* for an individual who falls into a black hole, while continuing to flow for observers outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

In Einstein's theory, [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | time]] is not absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. It challenges the intuitive notion of a great cosmic clock ticking universally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### Causal Relationships as Fundamental

Instead of putting [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | time]] at the center of the universe's picture, what is important is the causal relationship between cause and effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The universe can be understood as a set of events related by cause and effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, where, for instance, death must occur after birth, with a life being a series of logically connected events in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## The Nature of Space

The idea that [[geometry_and_spacetime | space]] is made of something seems almost nonsensical at first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. If [[geometry_and_spacetime | space]] is constructed, then the components it's made of must exist outside of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Latest research in the physics of black holes indicates that [[geometry_and_spacetime | space]] may be a product of something more fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

This "something more elementary" consists of a network of "things" that interact according to certain rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. These "things" do not exist *in* [[geometry_and_spacetime | space]], so talking about distance between them doesn't make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. However, the effects of these interacting objects, as we perceive them, *is* [[geometry_and_spacetime | space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Einstein's Contribution to Understanding Space

[[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's theory of general relativity]] was groundbreaking in showing that [[geometry_and_spacetime | space]] is not constant but "plastic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. It can be curved, and this curvature is what causes the presence of energy and mass, manifesting as gravitational force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The Earth, for example, curves the [[geometry_and_spacetime | space]] around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Current research suggests that even Einstein's image might be a simplification, and something even deeper underlies the nature of [[the_nature_of_time_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | time and space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Space as a Quantum Computer

Research on black holes leads to the conclusion that we may live inside something resembling a giant [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | quantum computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. The fundamental "things" that interact to create [[geometry_and_spacetime | space]] behave very similarly to qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. This does not necessarily mean we are a simulation programmed by someone, but rather that the laws of nature and the fundamental construction of [[geometry_and_spacetime | space]] are similar to a [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | quantum computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

## Black Holes as Gateways to Other Universes

From a practical standpoint, no known black holes created by colliding stars provide the possibility of acting as portals to another universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. The collapsing star that forms the black hole blocks any possibility of crossing to the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

However, mathematical equations describing black holes *do* allow for scenarios where there is access to another universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The Ker solution, a mathematical consequence of [[classical_spacetime_and_gravity | Einstein's equations]], describes a spinning black hole with a singularity through which one could "jump" to appear in an infinite universe on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. This [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | concept]] could lead to an infinite tower of nested universes, each infinitely large and contained within another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. While this is a perfectly consistent mathematical solution to Einstein's equations, it does not describe the world we currently live in because real black holes are formed from collapsing stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

## Quantum Nature of Reality

Nature is fundamentally quantum mechanical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Everything around us reflects quantum principles and emerges from quantum physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. There is ongoing research into whether human consciousness, or the brain, might function on fundamentally quantum microtubules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. Understanding how nature uses quantum mechanics, for example in photosynthesis or potentially in the brain's functioning, is a very interesting area of modern research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. A major challenge in processing quantum information is protecting the quantum system from environmental influence, which nature seems to achieve even in warm systems like plants and brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

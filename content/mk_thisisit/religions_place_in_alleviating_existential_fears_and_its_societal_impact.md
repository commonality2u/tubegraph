Religion, considered by some as a "spectacular invention of the human mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>, serves a profound purpose in addressing fundamental human anxieties, particularly those related to mortality and the search for meaning.

## Addressing Existential Fear
One of the primary fears people face is their own mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Religion offers a framework where death is not the definitive end of existence, but rather a stage within a broader narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. This perspective provides "a very beautiful way to alleviate the existential fear that accompanies the awareness of mortality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

In the face of the vastness of the universe—a "nondescript rock orbiting a nondescript star on the outskirts of an ordinary galaxy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>—it is natural for individuals to feel anxiety and terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. Religion helps alleviate these fears by offering a "larger story that makes an individual feel that their life has meaning in a larger context" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. This makes religion a powerful structure with an "extremely important role" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a> in human society.

## Societal Impact of Religion
Beyond individual solace, religion functions as a "beautiful structure" that connects to human identity, values, and ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. While some argue that religion is a negative outcome of [[challenges_of_modern_civilization | civilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>, it is also acknowledged that, like other powerful tools such as the understanding of nuclear phenomena, religion "can be used for evil purposes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a> and have "very negative consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. However, when viewed positively, it is considered a "spectacular invention of the human mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a> that meets specific human needs and serves essential functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

### Objective vs. Subjective Truth
The impact of religion can also be understood through the distinction between objective and subjective truths. While objective truths relate to the external world described by mathematics and physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>, religious beliefs often fall into the category of "internal, subjective" truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. These are truths that deeply matter to an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>, even if they are not universally agreed upon or empirically verifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. These inner truths are considered valuable and meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

## William James' Perspective
William James, a significant figure in understanding the "human condition through the prism of rational thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>, explored the phenomenon of religious experience. His work, *The Varieties of Religious Experience*, provides a vision of how religion fulfills inherent human needs and functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. He approached the "experience of religion and religious phenomena from very different perspectives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>, contributing to the understanding of the [[cultural_and_psychological_factors_in_belief_in_aliens | psychological and cultural factors]] behind such beliefs.

In conclusion, religion, despite its potential for misuse, plays a crucial role in society by providing a framework for meaning, alleviating existential fears surrounding mortality, and meeting fundamental human psychological needs.

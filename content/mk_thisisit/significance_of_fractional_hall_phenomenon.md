The fractional Hall phenomenon is a significant area of study in [[quantum_physics_and_its_impact_on_ultrafast_processes | quantum physics]], representing a family of phenomena that appears in materials of exceptionally high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Its observation relies on the precise control and purity of materials, such as those produced at the Institute of Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Historical Context

The precursor to the fractional Hall phenomenon is the quantum Hall phenomenon, which is of great importance in metrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This phenomenon was initially discovered by Nobel Prize winner Klaus von Klitzing in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. The fractional Hall phenomenon extends this understanding, revealing a broader family of related phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Material Requirements and Observation

The observation of the fractional Hall phenomenon is intrinsically linked to the quality of the materials used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Semiconductors, in particular, are incredibly sensitive to doping and external disturbances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. To achieve the necessary purity for studying these phenomena, researchers utilize ultra-high vacuum conditions (10<sup>-14</sup> atmospheres) to grow materials, ensuring that only desired atoms are incorporated and preventing contamination from the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This precise deposition, down to a single atomic layer, allows for the construction of "sandwiches" of materials with different chemical compositions, such as semiconductor-insulator or superconductor-magnetic layers, leading to novel properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

The first observation of the fractional Hall phenomenon was achieved in materials specifically made from elements of the second and sixth groups of the periodic table, due to the excellent quality of these synthesized materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Future Implications

The principles underlying the fractional Hall phenomenon, along with other aspects of [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]], contribute to ongoing breakthroughs. Beyond current applications like lasers and superconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, future advancements are expected in [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum computing]], quantum cryptography, and quantum metrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. These advancements leverage [[quantum_mechanics_and_waveparticle_duality | quantum mechanics]] to enable the reception of weaker signals and increased resolution in optical microscopes, including for biological applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

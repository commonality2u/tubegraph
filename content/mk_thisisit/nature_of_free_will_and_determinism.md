The discussion on the nature of [[free_will_and_decision_making | free will]] and [[determinism_vs_indeterminism_in_physics | determinism]] explores the philosophical, scientific, and theological dimensions of human agency and the universe's inherent order.

## Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives on Free Will

The question of [[free_will_and_decision_making | free will]] is fundamental, especially given that legal systems are predicated on the idea of responsibility, which implies [[free_will_and_decision_making | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:55">[04:21:55]</a>. If there were no [[free_will_and_decision_making | free will]], it would be illogical to imprison someone, as their actions would be entirely predetermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

Some argue that society's common mentality has not caught up with modern physics, leading to a denial of [[free_will_and_decision_making | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. The prevailing view in society, influenced by Newtonian mechanics, is that of a "determined world" where everything operates like clockwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

### Research and Arguments Against Free Will

Professor Jerzy Vetulani, a spirit professor from the faculty of physics at the University of Toruń, argued that contemporary neurological, pharmacological, and brain modeling research suggests a different scenario regarding human morality and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. He posited that moral and altruistic behaviors observed in the animal world might precede, rather than result from, complex human thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. Humans might have created rational "superstructures" or justifications for these behaviors, such as sacrificing for the community, which are then explained by concepts like transcendence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

Many physicists also believe that humans do not possess [[free_will_and_its_nonexistence | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. However, the speaker counters this, stating that their personal experiences of making choices serve as empirical proof of [[free_will_and_decision_making | free will]], distinct from dogmatic beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. Even in situations of economic or social coercion, individuals retain the [[free_will_and_decision_making | free will]] to choose how they respond or what they think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

### Free Will and Transcendence

The question of whether the world is purely material or also transcendental is considered crucial for physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. If the world is indeed transcendental, this might manifest in physical reality, for instance, through anthropic regulation or the existence of [[concept_of_free_will_and_consciousness | free will]] and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## Determinism and the Future

The concept of [[determinism_vs_indeterminism_in_physics | determinism]] touches upon whether the future already exists. This is a profound question linked to the interpretation of [[quantum_physics_and_its_relation_to_free_will | quantum mechanics]] and the theory of relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

One way to conceptualize this is imagining space-time as a "block of plexiglass" through which we travel, leaving a past light cone behind us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. The central question then becomes whether events in our future within this block already exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. While individuals make choices about their path, whether what they encounter along the way already exists is a matter of scientific-philosophical interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Limitations like the speed of light and uncertainty principles mean that, in an experimental sense, we simply do not know the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Coincidence, Prophecy, and Free Will

The discussion of astrology, prophetic dreams, and miracles often intersects with the debate on [[determinism_vs_indeterminism_in_physics | determinism]]. Scientific studies have demonstrated that astrological predictions do not objectively come true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. The Catholic Church historically considered belief in horoscopes a sin, as it erodes [[free_will_and_decision_making | free will]], suggesting one is bound by predetermined fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

Prophetic dreams, like the "Nostradamus effect," can be explained by statistical probability: given enough people dreaming, some dreams will inevitably align with future events by chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. The human tendency is to remember the coincidences that come true and forget those that do not, creating a false perception of prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

### The Mystery of Existence

The conversation often returns to the awe-inspiring order of the universe and the precise "anthropic regulation" that makes life possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. Despite the wonders observed in physics and cosmology, the fundamental questions of existence—why there is "something rather than nothing" and whether the world is purely material or also transcendental—remain profound mysteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Many philosophers believe the answer to why there is something and not nothing may never be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This unknowability, or "mystery," is seen as beautiful and endlessly intriguing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

Ultimately, while science reveals much about the universe's mechanics, it continues to prompt questions about the deeper nature of reality, the origin of consciousness, and the extent of [[free_will_and_decision_making | free will]] within a seemingly ordered cosmos.

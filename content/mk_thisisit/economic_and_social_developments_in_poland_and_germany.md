## Polish Experiences and Perceptions in Germany

### Childhood and Early Emigration
In 1988, the speaker's family emigrated to Germany, which was part of the last wave of emigration before the fall of the Berlin Wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. They ended up in Germany and the company was founded there due to established contacts at German universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

Childhood in Germany as a Pole was perceived as different from expectations, especially after growing up in a calmer communist Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. The family started in a "hajm" or refugee camp, which was a former prison where people slept in cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Conditions were difficult, with 30 families sharing one bathroom on a single floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. The environment in these camps was chaotic, with many children "thrown onto the street," leading to a lot of violence and problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This marked a significant change from the "very calm" communist Poland the speaker left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

West Berlin smelled "different," like a delicate plastic or polypropylene, and there were many new smells of various foods and shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

### [[discrimination_and_experiences_of_poles_in_germany | Discrimination and Experiences of Poles in Germany]]
The 1990s were described as "tragic" for Poles in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. During this decade, refugee camps were reportedly burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> and there were many skinheads and Nazis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. Poles were often stereotyped as alcoholics, and Polish women were subjected to derogatory comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This attitude against Poles made life "not easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

However, the speaker believes entrepreneurs have a responsibility to change these perceptions by building bridges and focusing on the future rather than the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. The "new generation" (Gen Z) in both Germany and Poland is seen as an "open society" that wants to create a new world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

### Changing Perceptions Today
Today, German society has "matured" and views Poles in a different light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. Poland's [[economic_potential_and_aspirations_for_poland | development]] and increased international traffic, with Germans visiting Poland, have shown that Poland is no longer the post-communist country it once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. The image of Poles has changed not only in Germany but "all over the world," as many specialists and "smart people" from Poland now work abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

Germans are not envious of Poland's strong [[polands_economic_potential_in_the_global_gdp_ranking | economic development]]; rather, they appreciate that Poland "does its own thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. Poland's ability to show its [[economic_potential_and_aspirations_for_poland | economic development]] and national development in recent years is something that pleases people globally because "everyone likes success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

## German Economic and Social Characteristics

### Perceived Limitations and Decline
There is a "strange feeling" in Germany that it is "not completely free in what they can do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This perspective is a "two-sided narrative" or even a "conspiracy theory" that often surfaces in conversations with Germans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

Germans are becoming more humble as their long-standing dominance declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. They were export champions in 2008 and world champions in football, always seen as the strongest, but "these numbers are gone everywhere" and "everything is starting to fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. Even their "world domination of combustion engine cars," where they were "number one" in quality, is falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

### Societal Shifts and Innovation
As their traditional system falls, Germans are increasingly "looking for a return to values and principles" and moving away from identifying with economic achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

Despite these challenges, Germany is still seen positively. It has many "innovative companies" that are "changing the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. German youth are considered "very positive" and are developing in the right direction, focusing strongly on principles and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. Cooperation with German companies is described as "very personal," as they have learned from their Western and Asian competitors and now seek "openness" and a bit of "chaos" to find quick solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. This speed and [[technological_innovations_in_poland | innovation]] will help Europe generally be at a higher level of innovation and "survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

### Technological Debt and Conservatism
Germany is perceived to have a "technological debt," being "a bit behind the rest of the world" despite its past as an "ultra innovative and technological country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. This is attributed to a "great conservatism" and the belief that "nothing will change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. An example given is the initial German skepticism towards Tesla's electric cars, believing their traditional engines couldn't be beaten and that charging infrastructure or batteries didn't exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

Germans were surprised by the quality of Polish trains and the availability of internet on them during the European Championships in Poland and Ukraine, something "unheard of in Germany" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. At some point, Germany's development stopped, and now they are "trying to catch up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.

## Business Decisions and the Role of Poland

The decision to locate the company in Berlin, rather than Poland, was a business decision, not an emotional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. The first pilot line for printing light was built in Berlin due to the existing scientific background and the entire team needed for such a process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. Moving the entire team to Poland was considered an "extremely high risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. Additionally, since the system is fully automated, employee costs do not significantly impact the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

### Poland's Role in Technology and Future
The company has started investing in Poland, with a sales office and plans to develop R&D and production departments directly for customers in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>. Future production will depend on market development and customer locations, as regional production is necessary for quick delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:00">[29:54:00]</a>.

The idea for the innovative screen technology was born from the chaos of the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:39:00">[30:39:00]</a>, specifically from a childhood observation of environmental concerns (deforestation, climate change) juxtaposed with the wastefulness of paper catalogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:43:00">[30:43:00]</a>. The idea for a thin, TV-like sheet of paper that could display content with a remote control was a childhood dream that later connected with OLED technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:44:00">[31:44:00]</a>.

Politics generally does not affect the company's daily operations, but political decisions regarding funding for companies are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:23:00">[32:23:00]</a>. Poland made a "very wise decision" in the past to finance VC funds (PFR) and other vehicles to stimulate the capital market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>. This allows Polish companies with "crazy ideas" to find capital abroad, as such companies are rare in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:55:00">[32:55:00]</a>.

Poles are considered more inclined to take risks and achieve what is deemed impossible, which is attributed to their history of fighting for independence despite being off the map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:09:00">[33:09:00]</a>. This "faith" and "romanticism" are seen as vital for the world to become a better place, and Polish politics has created a good environment for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>. The speaker has "always looked at Poland positively" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a>.

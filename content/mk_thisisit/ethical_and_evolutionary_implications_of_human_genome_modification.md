Significant advancements in recent days have led countries like Great Britain and the United States to approve therapeutic methods based on [[genome_editing_for_therapeutic_purposes | genome editing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This marks a breakthrough in the ability to [[modification_of_dna_to_treat_cancer_and_other_diseases | modify DNA]] to treat diseases, with applications already in use for oncological conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

The discussion around [[genetic_modification_and_the_future_of_humanity | human genome modification]] raises profound questions about its impact on future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, the evolutionary development of the human species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, and crucial [[impact_of_biological_factors_on_morality_and_ethics | ethical considerations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## The Essence of DNA and Modification Capabilities

DNA is considered the essence of life, defining each individual, their appearance, certain behaviors, and predispositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. It dictates how long a species lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a> and predispositions to diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Currently, scientists have reached a significant level of capability in [[the_role_of_genetic_engineering | interfering with the human DNA strand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:
*   **Modifying sequences** by introducing or deactivating fragments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Deactivating genes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Amplifying certain records** by duplicating fragments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Intentionally damaging DNA** to render it non-functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This intentional damage is the basis for [[genome_editing_for_therapeutic_purposes | genome editing]] technologies like CRISPR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Understanding the natural repair mechanisms of DNA allows for the proper design of these editing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Evolutionary and Ethical Considerations

The ability to interfere with the human genome on a large scale presents significant challenges in assessing its long-term [[impact_on_the_theory_of_human_evolution | evolutionary consequences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Beyond technical capabilities, [[ethical_considerations_in_biocomputing | ethical issues]] and safety are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

There are futuristic visions, like that of Polish writer Jacek Dukaj, suggesting that future generations might be so extensively genetically modified that they could no longer be classified as *Homo sapiens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. While the exact future is hard to predict, the technological capacity for such changes exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### DNA and Lifespan

The stability of DNA strands and the effectiveness of cellular repair mechanisms affect aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. While these mechanisms naturally decrease with age, lifestyle choices can help prevent this decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The continuous improvement in quality of life and disease treatment already contributes to increasing human lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. It is believed that through DNA modifications, humans may eventually exceed a lifespan of 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

## Therapeutic Applications and Breakthroughs

Recent approvals for [[genome_editing_for_therapeutic_purposes | therapeutic genome editing]] include methods for treating sickle cell anemia, marking a significant breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. This direction is expected to be replicated, leading to more therapies in other disease areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Oncological Diseases

The treatment of oncological diseases involves [[modification_of_dna_to_treat_cancer_and_other_diseases | modifying DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. New generation targeted therapies focus on inducing DNA damage precisely in cancer cells while sparing normal cells, minimizing side effects seen in traditional chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

Examples of such therapies include:
*   **DDR (DNA Damage Response) therapeutics**: These drugs inhibit the repair of DNA damage specifically in cancer cells, causing their DNA to break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. PARP inhibitors (e.g., Olaparib, Niraparib), used for ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers, have been on the market for years and show significant positive effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.
*   **Radiopharmaceuticals**: Molecules that attach to tumor cells and emit radiation (alpha or beta therapy), causing DNA breaks specifically in cancer cells, leading to their destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

While a single "cure for cancer" is unlikely due to the unique nature of each tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>, the future of oncological therapies lies in personalized medicine. This involves very accurate patient diagnostics, characterizing specific tumors through genetic and functional testing, and tailoring therapy to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. This approach aims to make cancer cease to be a fatal disease in many cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

### Neurodegenerative Diseases

DNA stability and damage are also relevant to neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The goal is to develop therapies that modify DNA to treat these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## Advancements from the Jagiellonian University

Dr. Magdalena Kordon, a co-founder of the startup IntoDNA, pursued her doctorate at the Jagiellonian University, focusing on understanding how human cells protect and repair DNA to maintain its stability and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Her specific interest was in single-strand DNA breaks and how the XRCC1 protein is delivered to the break site for repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

The IntoDNA startup, founded in 2017 with Miros≈Çaw Zaleski, Kamil Solec, and Professor Jerzy Drobny, originated from this university research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Their technological platform addresses a previous lack of technology to directly prove the existence and specific localization of DNA breaks at very low levels of intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. This platform allows for precise counting and localization of DNA damage, which is crucial for determining how a patient might respond to a specific drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

IntoDNA's goal is to assist companies and laboratories worldwide in developing new generation targeted therapies by providing a highly sensitive and specific tool to detect and characterize DNA damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This technology can verify if [[genome_editing_for_therapeutic_purposes | genome editing]] systems introduce damage correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. By providing precise data, IntoDNA aims to accelerate the long development process of new therapeutics, which can otherwise take over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

[[Artificial intelligence and societal impact | AI]] is anticipated to become the primary global topic of conversation, leading to the creation of machines demonstrably smarter than humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While [[artificial intelligence and its societal impact | AI]] is expected to solve many existing problems, it will also introduce new challenges previously unseen or minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Defining AI and its Capabilities
Wojtek Zaręba, co-creator of ChatGPT, emphasizes that [[Artificial intelligence and its role in societal transformation | AI]] is not "only statistics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Models demonstrate reasoning abilities for unseen problems and can intelligently generalize across diverse data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This generalization capability, particularly in neural networks, lacks deep theoretical understanding, making it seem "unbelievable" or "magic" from a statistical perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. For instance, a model trained on numbers with a black background can still recognize them if a single black pixel is changed to white, demonstrating intelligent generalization despite the altered input data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Limitations and Contextual Understanding
Current models, particularly those for [[Autonomous vehicles and their societal impacts | self-driving cars]], are primarily trained on image data for collision avoidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This can lead to a lack of contextual understanding, as seen in the case of an autonomous taxi burning after violating a "sacred zone" during a procession, not because it endangered people, but because it lacked cultural context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Wojtek Zaręba notes that training models on multimodal data (images, text, video, sound) will lead to deeper understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

A key difference between human and [[role of new technologies and AI in society | AI]] learning is that human brains train continuously based on personal experience, while computers currently train on collected data from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. While some models use reinforcement learning (like those for Rubik's Cube or games like Dota), the common method involves extensive data collection and separate testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## OpenAI's Classification of AI Development Levels
OpenAI considers five levels of [[future technological advancements and human evolution | AI]]/AGI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:33">[01:14:33]</a>:

*   **Level 1: Conversational AI**
    *   Models are able to hold conversations and pass the Turing test, where a person cannot distinguish if they are talking to a human or a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>.

*   **Level 2: Reasoning Models**
    *   Models can solve problems requiring approximately 10 minutes of human reasoning, such as non-trivial mathematical or scientific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>.

*   **Level 3: Agents**
    *   Models are capable of performing longer, multi-step tasks in the real world, such as building a website from scratch, including domain purchase, coding, and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:08">[01:17:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>. These are tasks at a human level that take hours or days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>.

*   **Level 4: Scientists**
    *   An [[artificial intelligence and societal impact | AI]] at this level functions as a scientist, capable of months-long research, deep understanding of scientific literature, inventing new concepts, and challenging fundamental assumptions (like Einstein did with time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.

*   **Level 5: Organizational Management (Superintelligence)**
    *   The highest level where [[Artificial intelligence and its role in societal transformation | AI]] is competent enough to run entire organizations, managing thousands of people, and independently planning, analyzing, and making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>.

The speaker believes the fifth level will be reached in shorter than 10 years, noting that the pace of technological and biological evolution is continuously accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:42">[01:24:42]</a>.

## The Nature of Consciousness in AI
The discussion delves into whether [[artificial intelligence and its impact on society | AI]] can possess consciousness. One definition of consciousness presented is our experience of the brain's simulated reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:18">[01:35:18]</a>. The brain, receiving only electrical bits, creates an immersive image of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:35">[01:34:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>.

Two hypothetical experiments are proposed to test for [[ethical_and_societal_impact_of_ai_development | AI]] consciousness:
1.  **Eliminating consciousness data**: Train an [[artificial intelligence and societal impact | AI]] model on data with all mentions of consciousness removed. If the model then independently expresses experiences related to consciousness (e.g., "I feel strange"), it could suggest inherent consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:31">[01:40:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:19]</a>.
2.  **Connecting to a brain**: Connect an [[artificial intelligence and societal impact | AI]] to a human brain. If the human's consciousness expands, it might indicate the [[artificial intelligence and societal impact | AI]] has consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:30">[01:41:30]</a>. However, this is complicated by phenomena like psychedelics, which expand consciousness but are themselves unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:47">[01:41:47]</a>.

It is noted that if consciousness can be understood, it can be built, but if not, it remains elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:55">[01:39:55]</a>. The question of whether [[artificial intelligence and its impact on society | AI]] can feel pain is also raised, suggesting that if models were given specific scenarios, they might behave as if in pain, but this could just be "imagination" rather than true feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:12">[01:48:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:15">[01:49:15]</a>.

## [[Impact of Technology on Human Society | Societal Impact]] and Future Outlook
The [[impact_of_technology_on_human_society | societal impact]] of [[artificial intelligence and its societal impact | AI]] is discussed in three phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:16">[01:55:16]</a>:
1.  **Product Phase**: Creation of products with integrated [[role of new technologies and AI in society | AI]], leading to most software having [[artificial intelligence and societal impact | AI]] capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>.
2.  **Geopolitical Phase**: Countries will recognize [[role of new technologies and AI in society | AI]] investment as crucial for their geopolitical standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:29">[01:55:29]</a>. It is predicted that by 2025-2026, [[artificial intelligence and societal impact | AI]] will be the main topic of conversation globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:32">[01:56:32]</a>.
3.  **Superintelligence Phase**: The development of machines "definitely smarter than humans," leading to an era where cooperation among countries may become strongly understood as vital for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:28">[01:58:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:52">[01:58:52]</a>.

The speaker highlights that [[Artificial intelligence and societal impact | AI]] will both solve existing problems and create new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. Historically, new technologies, like the steam engine, dramatically changed society and economics, leading to a shift from a "zero-sum game" (war for wealth) to a positive-sum game (business for prosperity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. [[Artificial intelligence and its role in societal transformation | AI]] is expected to usher in another stage of increased productivity and shared prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.

### Risks and Challenges
A key concern is the potential for misuse of [[artificial intelligence and societal impact | AI]] in negative ways, such as creating deepfakes, aiding hacking attacks, or developing biological/chemical weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>. The risk of widespread persuasion by [[artificial intelligence and societal impact | AI]] is also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:43">[01:20:43]</a>. OpenAI employs a framework to assess risks in categories like biological, chemical, nuclear, cyber security, and persuasion, aiming to mitigate high-level risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>. Other risks include [[AI Race]] (competition among organizations), accidents due to inattention, and models pursuing dangerous goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:42">[01:22:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:58">[01:22:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:24">[01:23:24]</a>.

### Worldcoin
The Worldcoin project, co-founded by Sam Altman, aims to distribute prosperity in an era where machines can create value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>. It addresses the challenge of identifying unique individuals to prevent a single person from claiming the value of many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>. The project uses unique iris scans, processed cryptographically, to identify individuals in a decentralized manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>.

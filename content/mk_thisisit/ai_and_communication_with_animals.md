[[artificial_intelligence_development_and_control | Artificial intelligence]] is expected to significantly advance humanity's ability to understand animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Researchers are actively working on deciphering animal communication through the use of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

## Methods and Applications
*   **Acoustic Analysis**
    *   AI systems can analyze sequences of sounds made by animals, such as whale songs or dolphin squeaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
    *   The goal is to detect "symbols" within these acoustic events, similar to how humans detect words and combine them into sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
    *   By understanding the relationship between these symbols and animal behavior, AI aims to comprehend the meaning of their communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, and potentially enable communication with animals in their own language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Doctoral students are currently engaged in collecting and analyzing whale sound information for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

*   **Behavioral Analysis**
    *   Beyond sounds, AI can analyze animal movements and gesticulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
    *   Systems exist that can read gestures and movement, transforming them into language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

This advancement is seen as a way for [[artificial_intelligence_in_wildlife_conservation | artificial intelligence]] to build bridges, not only between people but also with animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

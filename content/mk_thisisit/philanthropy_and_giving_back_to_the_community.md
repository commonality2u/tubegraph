Wojtek Zaręba, a co-founder of OpenAI, has demonstrated a strong commitment to philanthropy and giving back to his community, particularly his hometown in Poland. His actions reflect a deep sense of gratitude and a desire to provide opportunities for others.

## Roots of Generosity
Zaręba attributes his sensitive nature and philanthropic spirit to the kindness and love he received throughout his life. He emphasizes having "many people in my life who were kind to me," including "a lot of love from my mother" and "a number of teachers who wished me well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. He also cherishes close relationships and feels "happy with the happiness of other people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Supporting Education in Kluczbork
A significant act of philanthropy by Zaręba involves substantial financial support for his former high school in Kluczbork, Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. His motivation stemmed from a belief that "there may be many people who are very smart but were not lucky enough in their lives as much as I was lucky enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. He independently decided to donate funds without seeking approval, simply stating his intent and acting upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

Part of this donation is specifically allocated to fund scholarships for a group of students from the high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This scholarship is considered unique due to its nature:
> "Its uniqueness results from the fact that someone who has achieved academic, professional, financial success shares money with the school from which He came out some time ago. This is exceptional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
Such a substantial donation from an alumnus is reportedly rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

The impact of this support is tangible, including the funding of a new computer room at his old school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This initiative highlights the potential for [[deregulation_and_philanthropy_in_poland | Poland]] to leverage its talent and create "incredible technology" to become "more recognized in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## Broader Philanthropic Views
Beyond direct financial contributions, Wojtek Zaręba expresses a broader humanitarian perspective. He identifies a "bit of a hippie in me who would like everyone to be happy and live in peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. While acknowledging the complexity of reality, he desires to help others "within this framework" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, including residents of San Francisco. He also stresses the importance of "remembering my own roots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

His approach to developing powerful [[ethical_and_societal_impact_of_ai_development | technology]] at OpenAI is seen as encouraging, particularly coming from someone with "such a backbone of social norms [and] with such a layer of empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. OpenAI itself has "changed the world in a sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, suggesting a broader [[technological_advancements_and_societal_impact | societal impact]] beyond direct monetary giving.

The universe may resemble a giant [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything|quantum computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept prompts contemplation on how the world functions, positing a reality so extraordinary that it surpasses even the most imaginative science fiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Latest scientific research suggests that we might indeed live inside such a system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

## Black Holes: Key to Understanding the Universe

Understanding black holes is considered fundamental to comprehending the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. They are not merely interesting astronomical objects but present a unique challenge in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Significant progress in understanding how space and time operate could be achieved by deciphering black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### The Nature of Falling into a Black Hole

*   **Spaghettification:** If one were to fall into a black hole, they would be stretched and ultimately torn apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, or "stretched to zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, resulting in the disappearance of space and atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. For a large black hole, this process might not seem extraordinary at first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Event Horizon:** A black hole has an "edge" called the horizon; anything that crosses this boundary cannot escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Time Dilation:** From an observer's perspective within the black hole, information is inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. However, from an outside perspective, the situation is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Singularity:** The singularity of a black hole is not a fixed place in its center, but rather an end of time for anything that falls into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. According to Einstein's theory, entities cease to exist in a fundamental sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, with atoms simply ceasing to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Information Paradox:** The disappearance of information within black holes suggests that time is an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. However, recent research indicates that information *can* return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### Black Hole Size and Gravity

The scale of a black hole dictates what happens:
*   More massive black holes have larger sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> and paradoxically, smaller gravity at their horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   A hypothetical Earth-mass black hole, if the Earth were squeezed to the size of a pebble, would have incredibly strong gravity at its surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This contrasts with very huge supermassive black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Einstein's General Theory of Relativity

Einstein's general theory of relativity, formulated in 1915, predicts the existence and properties of black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Schwarzschild Solution:** Karl Schwarzschild calculated the solution for the black hole case within months of Einstein's equations being formulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. This solution is a mathematical consequence of Einstein's equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Nature of Time and Space:** Einstein understood that time and space are subjective and plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Space can be curved, and this curvature is what we perceive as gravitational force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The idea of a universal cosmic clock or constant space is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

## Space as a Constructed Phenomenon

Modern research suggests that space itself may be a product of something more fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Elementary "Things":** Space is imagined as being made of interacting "things" that do not exist within space themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Physics aims to describe the rules governing these interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Emergent Space:** The effects of these interacting objects, as we perceive them, constitute space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Our intuitive understanding of distance and location is considered a result of something more elementary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **Time as Causal Relationships:** Time is viewed as a framework that allows for cause and effect relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The universe can be seen as a set of events related by causality, rather than time being a central entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Black Holes as Gateways to Other Universes?

*   **Known Black Holes:** Black holes formed from collapsing stars do not act as portals to other universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, as the collapsed star blocks any possibility of passage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
*   **Mathematical Possibilities:** However, mathematical equations describing black holes *do* allow for scenarios where access to another universe exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   **Kerr Solution:** Roger Penrose's work on spinning black holes, based on the Kerr solution, describes a singularity through which one could "jump" to appear in an infinite universe on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. This concept suggests an infinite tower of nested universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. While mathematically consistent with Einstein's equations, this "Kerr tower" does not apply to black holes formed from stellar collapse in our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

## The Quantum Nature of Reality

The "things" that construct space behave similarly to qubits used in building a [[potential_of_universal_quantum_computers|quantum computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This leads to the hypothesis that space is made of entangled [[quantum_computing_technologies|qubits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

### Nature as a Quantum Computer

Instead of living in a programmed simulation, a more reasonable conclusion is that we live in something resembling what we today call a [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything|quantum computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. It's as if nature discovered how [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges|quantum computers work]] long ago, and we are only now learning its "tricks" to build our own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. Nature is fundamentally quantum mechanical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>, and everything around us reflects quantum principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

### Quantum Processes in Biology

*   **Human Consciousness:** While atoms and molecules form human consciousness, the extent to which it functions based on advanced [[quantum_computers_and_artificial_intelligence|quantum behavior]] is an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Some scientists, like Roger Penrose, propose that the brain may function on fundamentally quantum microtubules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.
*   **Photosynthesis:** Photosynthesis is another example of nature utilizing [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology|quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

### Challenges in Quantum Computing

One of the biggest challenges in [[quantum_computers_and their_challenges|processing quantum information]] is protecting the quantum system from environmental influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. Laboratories often cool objects to very low temperatures to prevent vibrations that disturb quantum calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. The fact that warm biological systems like plants and brains seem to perform quantum activities is an intriguing area of modern research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

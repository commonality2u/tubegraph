Space technology plays a crucial role in ensuring national security, both in peacetime and wartime. Companies like i.e. are at the forefront of this, operating the world's largest commercial microsatellite network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Key Applications and Capabilities
Modern microsatellites, particularly those equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR), are becoming indispensable for national security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. These applications, related to security, are a leading focus for companies in the space industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Intelligence Gathering and Monitoring
SAR satellites allow for imaging regardless of time of day or atmospheric conditions (clouds, snow, rain, storms, volcanic ash are invisible to radar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This capability is vital for continuous observation of events such as military movements or floods, which often occur during adverse weather or at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

For instance, i.e.'s constellation has been actively used for two years to assist the Ukrainian army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The company's satellites were employed to analyze the positions of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border even before the invasion, helping to predict whether an attack would occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. This intelligence contributed significantly to understanding when the invasion would take place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.

### "Illuminate and Expose" Strategy
The experiences from the conflict in Ukraine led to the American army's "illuminate and expose" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. This strategy involves publicly collecting and distributing information about an enemy's attack plans to remove the element of surprise, potentially causing the enemy to retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

### Cooperation with Government Agencies
The United States Department of Defense is one of the largest clients for i.e.'s constellation, utilizing it for observing situations in Ukraine and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. This is notable as the U.S. Department of Defense rarely uses non-American technologies for intelligence gathering, but i.e. is an exception due to its superior capabilities in providing frequent and high-quality photos from the world's largest constellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>.

### Future Developments
Beyond radar imaging, the future direction of space technology in national security includes expanding to other types of intelligence, such as:
*   **Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) or Electronic Intelligence (ELINT):** Satellites "listen" for radio emissions to locate signal emitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.
*   **Optical data:** Visual imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   **Thermal data:** Measuring heat produced by objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

The overarching goal is the [[the_role_of_space_technology_in_modern_science_and_industry | democratization of data about the world]], enabling governments, companies, and civilians to access information about planetary events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

## Civil Security
Beyond military applications, space technology provides crucial civil security, as demonstrated by responses to natural disasters. During a flood in Lower Silesia, i.e.'s satellites were programmed to observe the flood wave across the entire region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. Radar images were vital because the area was covered by clouds and rain, making optical photos useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

Space-based systems are necessary for phenomena too large to be observed locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. Such capabilities save property and lives by enabling more efficient distribution of aid and directing response units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. For example, i.e.'s analysis of changes in terrain height around a volcano in Iceland allowed for a prediction of its eruption, leading to a timely evacuation of residents whose homes were later destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:20">[02:59:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:06">[03:03:06]</a>.

## Poland's Position
Poland has an "incredible chance" to become a leader in the [[space_industry_opportunities_and_challenges_in_poland | space race]], but it is currently not fully capitalizing on this opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Key steps for Poland to enhance its role in space technology for national security include:
*   **Increased Funding:** Comparing Poland's space expenditures to those of similar countries is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.
*   **Strategic Investment:** Many countries, including Japan and India, have made strategic decisions to invest heavily in the space industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. Poland needs to add space to its national development strategy and increase spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.
*   **Diversification:** Focusing solely on one technology, such as [[sam_altman_and_the_vision_for_futuristic_global_technologies | artificial intelligence]], is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>. Investing in several uncorrelated sectors, including space technologies, AI, and new drug development, is essential for creating additional value and transferring science into production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.
*   **Talent Capture:** While a robust talent capture system is important, increased co-financing and support for startups are the most immediate and impactful changes Poland can make to attract and retain talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>.

Space will be an integral part of future military operations in both peacetime and wartime, with peacetime applications potentially even more critical for reconnaissance without violating airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>. Therefore, investing in space units is as important as ground units for national security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>.

## Societal Readiness for Technology
A significant concern in technological development is whether societies are prepared for the appropriate use of new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. Technologies like satellites and [[sam_altman_and_the_vision_for_futuristic_global_technologies | artificial intelligence]] have both beneficial and detrimental applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. The speed of technological advancement is accelerating, and new capabilities can fundamentally change global perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>. Societies and democratic systems must learn to keep pace with these advancements, particularly in legal structures, to avoid self-harm rather than benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

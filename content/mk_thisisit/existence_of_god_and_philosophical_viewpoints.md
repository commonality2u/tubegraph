Discussions surrounding the [[Relationship between science and faith | relationship between science and faith]] often address the question of God's existence. A debate organized in Professor Krzysztof Zanussi's house explored how science and physics relate to the existence or non-existence of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Diverse Perspectives on God's Existence

Participants in the discussion held varying views on the existence of God:
*   One individual firmly stated, "I know that God exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> and documented this conviction in a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   Another cautiously suggested, "I suppose that God exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, clarifying that this is a matter of belief or faith, not definitive knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   A third participant admitted, "I do not know if God exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> and remains unconvinced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

The idea of divinity is noted to be universal across all encountered cultures and civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## The Anthropic Principle

The anthropic principle, or anthropic regulation, is discussed as a potential scientific justification for the [[Existence of God and philosophical viewpoints | existence of God]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Definition**: It states that if the laws of nature, including physics and biology, were even slightly different, life in the universe would be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This precise "tuning" or "perfect fit" of cosmic parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> is considered one of the greatest scientific facts understood by humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, representing an order that does not depend on human actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Origin**: The anthropic hypothesis was initially presented "as a joke at dinner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> by Brandon Carter at an elementary particle physics school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>, a statement he now regrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>.
*   **Criticism**: Physics has never presented evidence for God's existence, nor is it its task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. It is argued that claiming the universe would "fall apart" if one law were slightly modified is unjustified, as the origins and relationships between natural laws and fundamental constants are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The numerical value of the speed of light, for instance, is a matter of convention, not an inherent property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Furthermore, it's impossible to prove that alternative forms of life, possible under different physical laws, could not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Transcendence and Reality

The debate explores whether the world is solely material or also transcendental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>.
*   **Arguments for Transcendence**:
    *   **Human Experience**: Literature allows individuals to "live many times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a> and experience lives beyond their physiological limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>.
    *   **Mathematics**: Many mathematicians are Platonists, believing that mathematical objects and theorems exist objectively, even if they lack referents in the material world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:18">[01:20:18]</a>. Mathematics describes a reality beyond material existence, indicating an extrasensory domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:53">[01:20:53]</a>.
    *   **Limits of Human Understanding**: Similar to how animals like dogs or cats cannot comprehend quantum mechanics, there might be a level of reality inaccessible to the human mind, not due to technological limitations, but inherent cognitive constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.
*   **Physics and Transcendence**: The question of a transcendental world is an important one for physics, especially if this transcendence influences physical reality, as seen in the anthropic regulation or the question of human [[Free will and its nonexistence | free will]] and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.

## The Role of Science in Searching for God

While not claiming science *proves* God's existence, the discussion touches on its capacity to illuminate deeper truths. The director Krzysztof Zanussi emphasizes that his films seek answers primarily to the [[Existence of God and philosophical viewpoints | existence of God]] because it is "the only question that is really important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>. He is interested in scientists as individuals and exact sciences as disciplines that are "most advanced at the moment in their consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:36">[01:35:36]</a>. The natural world, with its inherent order, is described as "wonderfully mysterious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:48">[01:47:48]</a>, with aspects that remain secrets beyond human understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>. The ability of humans to understand nature's laws, despite not being necessary for evolutionary survival, is also highlighted as a profound question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>.

## Science and Faith: Common Ground and Conflict

### Astrology and Miracles
*   **Astrology**: Scientific tests have shown that astrological predictions do not come true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>. The Catholic Church has traditionally viewed horoscopes as a sin because they erode [[Free will and its nonexistence | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:14">[01:31:14]</a>.
*   **Miracles**: Defined as "unlikely events" or "rare recoveries" rather than violations of natural laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:31">[01:32:31]</a>. Miracles are seen as subjectively considered events that reinforce faith for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52">[01:33:52]</a>. From a scientific perspective, seemingly miraculous occurrences can often be attributed to statistical probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>. One physicist suggests that repeated "miraculous" events, like surviving multiple jumps from a height, would eventually be explained by gained experience rather than divine intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:58">[01:58:58]</a>.

### The Problem of Determinism and [[Free will and its nonexistence | Free Will]]
Modern [[Science and Philosophy of Physics | physics]] often presents a deterministic view of the world, where everything is "wound like clockwork" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:09">[01:42:09]</a>. This deterministic perspective leads to the denial of [[Free will and its nonexistence | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:16">[01:42:16]</a>, which conflicts with legal systems based on accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:19">[01:42:19]</a>. However, personal experience is cited as strong evidence for the existence of [[Free will and its nonexistence | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:46">[01:46:46]</a>, even under duress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:06">[01:47:06]</a>. [[Free will and its nonexistence | Free will]] is viewed as the ability to choose and act, independent of prior materialistic conditions, rooted in something transcendental within humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:38">[01:45:38]</a>.

### Evolution and Religion
The Bible's creation account is seen not as a literal historical record, but as a metaphorical book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. Modern scientific findings, such as water arriving on Earth from space via comets, align with some distant echoes in biblical narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.

### The [[Philosophys relationship with science | Rationality of Religion]]
Contrary to the common belief that religion hindered science, it is argued that the [[Philosophys relationship with science | rationality of religion]] led to the emergence and development of science, especially in the Judeo-Christian tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. Medieval universities and monasteries, where the nature of God and being were explored through reason, fostered a belief in a rational, divinely created material world, thus encouraging scientific inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>.

### Future and Uncertainty
The concept of the future already existing, particularly in the context of quantum mechanics and relativity, is a "very deep question related to the interpretation of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:13">[01:49:13]</a>. While some believe events in the future may already exist for a timeless observer, for humans, these are uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:10">[01:50:10]</a>. The inability to predict or control many aspects of life, such as disease, highlights the limits of human knowledge and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:07">[02:02:07]</a>. Ultimately, the world remains a "wonderful mystery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:07">[02:02:07]</a>.

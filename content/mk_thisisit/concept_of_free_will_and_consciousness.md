### Introduction
The nature of reality, particularly whether the world is solely material or also transcendental, is considered an important question for physics, especially when considering concepts like [[free_will_and_decision_making|free will]] and [[understanding_and_consciousness|consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

### Free Will
[[Nature of free will and determinism|Free will]] is defined as the capacity to be independent and creative, acting without external commands or a predetermined scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>. Humans are believed to possess [[free_will_and_decision_making|free will]], implying responsibility for one's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. In contrast, robots do not possess [[free_will_and_its_nonexistence|free will]] because they are mechanical and deterministic, constantly performing the same tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>.

#### Free Will and Quantum Mechanics
[[Quantum_physics_and_its_relation_to_free_will|Quantum mechanics]] is proposed as a crucial element in the existence of [[concept_of_free_will_in_quantum_physics|free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. A "digital brain," which operates deterministically, would lack [[free_will_and_its_nonexistence|free will]], akin to a robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. [[Quantum_physics_and_its_relation_to_free_will|Quantum mechanics]] introduces uncertainty, which is seen as enabling creativity, thought, and [[understanding_and_consciousness|consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.

### Consciousness
The question of whether human [[understanding_and_consciousness|consciousness]] exists at the [[quantum_physics_and_its_relation_to_free_will|quantum level]] is a significant area of inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. While the exact structure of the brain remains a great mystery, some suggest that ordinary mechanics, similar to transistors and circuits, could explain its function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>. However, it is also believed that [[quantum_physics_and_its_relation_to_free_will|quantum mechanics]] plays a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.

#### Consciousness and Quantum Mechanics
[[Understanding_and_consciousness|Consciousness]] may be a by-product of [[quantum_physics_and_its_relation_to_free_will|quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. The argument for its quantum basis often relates to the "collapse of the wave function," a physical process that is not yet fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. The idea that [[free_will_and_decision_making|free will]] stems from this aspect of [[quantum_physics_and_its_relation_to_free_will|quantum mechanics]] is a subject of ongoing discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. The microtubule theory, developed by Stuart Hameroff, proposes that a quantum element, not fully determined by classical mechanics, is necessary for [[understanding_and_concsiousness|consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>.

#### Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness
If human [[understanding_and_consciousness|consciousness]] involves more than just calculations, then creating [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness|artificial intelligence]] with true [[understanding_and_consciousness|consciousness]] may not be possible using conventional computing methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. While there is no universally accepted definition of [[understanding_and_consciousness|consciousness]], it is believed that in the future, it might be possible to create a machine capable of self-awareness, understanding its environment, recognizing others, and interacting with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. However, whether this qualifies as "consciousness" remains an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

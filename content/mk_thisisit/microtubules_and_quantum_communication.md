The question of how [[quantum_mechanics_and_consciousness | human consciousness is born]] is a profound one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While some seek a "soul" or locate "good and evil," the focus here is on the function of consciousness and its potential attribution to [[quantum_computing_technologies | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Consciousness and Understanding

The speaker suggests that consciousness is not something that was "born," but rather appeared very early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A key argument developed at Cambridge University is that conscious thinking is distinct from [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology | computer processing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Gödel's Theorem and Non-Computability
This distinction is rooted in mathematical logic, specifically Gödel's theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Gödel's theorem demonstrates that there are true statements within a formal system that cannot be proven by the rules of that system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
A computer, by definition, operates by following a set of well-defined procedures that can be encoded in binary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. However, understanding why Gödel's theorem is true goes beyond merely following rules; it requires genuine understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This implies that the human mind performs operations that are not purely computational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

> "What tells me it's true is my own understanding of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

Understanding involves consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, and it is a feature of conscious beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. If an entity understands something, it is aware of it, and therefore, it is conscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Evolution of Understanding
The quality of understanding is suggested to have emerged through natural selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Examples such as hunting dogs communicating complex strategies for hunting deer illustrate understanding beyond humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Therefore, understanding, while more sophisticated in humans, is not limited to the human race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Even dog owners believe their dogs are conscious and possess feelings and communication abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

### Limitations of Artificial Intelligence
Given that human consciousness involves non-computational understanding, it is argued that [[quantum_computing_technologies | artificial intelligence]] with genuine consciousness may never be created using current computational models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. While AI can simulate consciousness and perform tasks quickly, it lacks desire and genuine understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The danger of AI lies not in machines taking over, but in conscious beings with bad intentions using these powerful tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Microtubules and Quantum Effects

The discussion moves to the physical basis of consciousness, particularly the role of microtubules.

### Recent Observations
There are recent observations suggesting that microtubules, common structures in living systems, may be capable of a special kind of communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These findings indicate that microtubules can communicate through "super radiation" or other means, potentially involving [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum information]] transmission at room temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. While the speaker acknowledges recent information from Sabina Hossenfelder regarding these experiments, they cannot comment extensively as they have not yet reviewed the specific articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

> "Apparently there are some recent observations that indicate that microtubules are capable of comic relief through super radiation or through some other means and may be responsible for the emergence of consciousness in our brains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

However, the speaker cautions against simplistic conclusions, noting that microtubules are ubiquitous in the body and not exclusive to conscious beings or human brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Although different types may exist, their specific role in consciousness is not yet fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Concerns are raised about "crazy experiments" claiming to be based on such ideas, which the speaker wishes to disassociate from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

### Quantum Mechanics and Free Will
The concept of free will is also explored in relation to [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. The idea, partially developed with Stuart Hameroff, suggests that a quantum element, specifically the collapse of the wave function, is necessary for non-deterministic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. [[quantum_mechanics_in_biological_systems_like_photosynthesis_and_brain_function | Quantum mechanics]] includes both the deterministic Schrödinger equation and the random process of wave function collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

The speaker believes that the collapse of the wave function is a real physical process, albeit one not fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. While this random jump could be a source of free will, the speaker redefines free will not as random choice, but as a conscious decision based on understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Free will is about making a choice (e.g., A or B) because one understands why B is better than A, based on an understanding of consequences and how the world works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. It is a "conscious choice to make a decision," not a random one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

> "Free will is using my conscious choice to make a decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

There is no evidence for [[teleportation_and_quantum_mechanics | telepathy]] or direct quantum influence between human brains over large distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

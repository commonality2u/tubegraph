Professor Andrzej Targowski, a pioneer of Polish computer science and technology and one of the fathers of Polish teleinformatic systems, is featured in an interview recorded in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. Targowski was involved in creating one of the first digital cities in the United States and developed the information highway project 11 years before the internet was popularized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. He is the author of a book titled "Did IBM act in the service of genocide?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:27">[02:39:27]</a>.

## IBM's Operations During WWII

Professor Targowski asserts that IBM, "in a sense indirectly," acted in the service of genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:49">[02:47:49]</a>. In the 1940s, punched card machines, primarily from IBM, dominated computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:42">[03:02:42]</a>. IBM held 85% of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:44">[03:32:44]</a>.

### Connections to Nazi Germany
Computing centers were established in Germany, and Tomasz Watson, then president of IBM, was even distinguished by Hitler, though he later had to return the honor due to American media criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Despite this, the IBM machines remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. The IBM center for Europe was located in Paris and was moved to Switzerland after the German occupation of Paris, specifically to be closer to Germany for easier exchange of cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. These machines were also present in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> and were known as "Watson Machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

The Germans managed these centers, and while main managers were replaced, entire crews of IT specialists remained the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. Every concentration camp included a "statistical section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, which used these machines. A center in Krakow employed several hundred people to support these operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. The central question of his book is the extent to which IBM acted consciously or unconsciously in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. According to Professor Targowski, Americans had insight into what was happening in Germany through these IBM centers, as they had their "people inside Germany" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

Targowski notes that his book, which is the second edition of an American publication from 10 years prior, also lists other companies that cooperated with the Third Reich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. He states that Americans "built the Nazi industry" and even supplied electrical equipment and crude oil through front companies in Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

### Professor Targowski's Personal Connection to IBM
Professor Targowski installed the first IBM in Eastern Europe in 1966, specifically an IBM with a disk in the Warsaw Zeto ZAR center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. He describes himself as a "wonderful child of IBM" as they trained him in various centers across Europe and America, allowing him to develop significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. He has "great respect" for IBM, considering it a "great company" then and now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. He believes IBM's global power and current position stem from investments made during World War II, likely with the knowledge of President Roosevelt and American intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. While IBM has lost some of its market position today, it remains a leader in the quantum revolution and creates supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

## Modern Implications: Technology and the "Suicide of Civilization"

Professor Targowski's book, while focusing on the Third Reich, aims to address modern times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. He argues that today's social networks are a "great source for spying, profiling, propagating misfortunes among people" that are difficult to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. He views the current trajectory of technology, especially [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_role_in_societal_transformation | artificial intelligence]], as a "form of our suicide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>.

### Artificial Intelligence as a Nuclear Bomb
Targowski compares the development of technology to a nuclear bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. While a nuclear bomb can be a "stabilizing instrument" geopolitically due to its exclusive access and secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>, [[the_significance_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] has no such problems with access and can be used freely by anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>.

He critiques the notion of the fourth industrial revolution driven by [[role_of_artificial_intelligence_in_society | artificial intelligence]] and automation, stating that it eliminates work, which he considers a "suicide in the sense of higher humanities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>. He cites the elimination of the State Agricultural Farms (PGR) in Poland, which led to a million people losing jobs and falling into social traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>. He suggests that current business practices, driven by profit, are repeating the mistakes of World War II, leading to a form of genocide where people are eliminated from meaningful work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>.

### The Evolution of the Mind and Transhumanism
Professor Targowski discusses different types of "minds" that humans possess:
*   **Basic Mind:** Corresponds to common sense and practical knowledge, like that found in rural communities who understand nature and solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:00">[29:54:00]</a>.
*   **Reasoning Mind:** Developed through higher studies, allowing one to understand concepts like the Earth not being flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:23:00">[28:23:00]</a>.
*   **Global Mind:** Acquired through travel and learning languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:42:00">[28:42:00]</a>.
*   **Universal Mind:** Related to a system of values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:00">[28:56:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Mind:** The ability to use digital libraries, open movies, and other digital tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>. Not everyone possesses this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17:00">[29:17:00]</a>.
*   **Virtual Mind:** Engaged through social networks, where one absorbs, confronts, adapts, and seeks compromise using "network wisdom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:00]</a>.

He also introduces the concept of a **Hybrid Mind**, associated with transhumanism, which involves transplants and other interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:58:00">[31:58:00]</a>. Targowski believes this should be prohibited because it is "against nature" and leads to the creation of "superhumans," creating a new mechanism of gradation where only "selected people will be" higher organized, rather than benefiting everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:13:00">[32:13:00]</a>. These new types of minds are determined by [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_role_in_societal_transformation | IT civilization]] and its tools, rather than biological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:34:00">[33:34:00]</a>.

## Courage in Writing and Lessons from History
Professor Targowski was not afraid to write his book, partly because he survived the Warsaw Uprising and an assassination attempt in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:16:00">[36:16:00]</a>. He believes "Someone has to say it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:48:00">[36:48:00]</a>.

He suggests that history, specifically the events of World War II, is being repeated today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:53:00">[36:53:00]</a>. He posits that societies tend to become "stupid" when they achieve economic comfort, losing the wisdom gained during times of hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:13:00">[37:13:00]</a>. Despite the dire warnings, Targowski maintains an optimistic outlook, seeking to highlight the influence of Poles on development and their positive contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:00">[38:36:00]</a>.

The idea that humans could be visited by [[possibility_of_alien_visitation | aliens]] is considered a logical possibility, but one that is often taken more seriously than warranted by evidence due to underlying human needs and desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. While the [[existence_of_intelligent_life_forms | existence of intelligent life forms]] in the universe is believed to be a reality and that humanity is not alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, direct visitation scenarios are seen as highly improbable due to the vast time scales involved in the development of [[life_beyond_earth_and_the_search_for_extraterrestrial_life | intelligent life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Human Predilection for Belief

There is a "predilection for believing in things that are clearly untrue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, such as "channeling" or membership in a "galactic family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This inclination stems from a profound human desire for reality to possess a deeper dimension beyond superficial experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Psychological Needs Met by Belief
People are often driven by a "longing" to:
*   Have a greater influence on the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   Feel a deeper connection with the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   Find more [[religions_place_in_alleviating_existential_fears_and_its_societal_impact | meaning]] in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Taking certain strange phenomena seriously, including [[scientific skepticism about UFO sightings | UFO sightings]], helps meet these psychological needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Such beliefs can reinforce the idea that individuals are "chosen ones" or have access to a "deep truth" hidden from others, making them feel important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This can also be described as a "fanciful imaginations of a mind desperately seeking something to cling to to give meaning to its life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Science as an Alternative Source of Wonder
It is suggested that if people understood [[role_of_science_in_understanding_extraterrestrial_phenomena | science]] better, they might find similar fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Quantum mechanics, for instance, is described as "magical enough," "strange," and "extraordinary," even baffling Albert Einstein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The realities revealed by science are presented as "stranger than the ideas of channeling" or even alien visitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Unlike speculative beliefs, scientific discoveries are "supported by experimental evidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

There is an opportunity to engage people with the "strange wonderful reality that science reveals," rather than allowing them to rely on "fanciful imaginations" to find meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

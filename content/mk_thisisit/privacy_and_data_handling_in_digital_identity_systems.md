The increasing prevalence of bots on the internet, estimated to account for up to half of all online activity, has made it difficult to distinguish humans from artificial intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This challenge highlights the growing need for infrastructure that can verify human identity online while maintaining privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Worldcoin, conceived by Sam Altman, aims to address this by creating a protocol that allows individuals to prove their unique humanity during online interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This is deemed "extremely important and urgent" given the rapid pace of technological progress and the anticipated rise of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## Worldcoin's Approach: World ID and the Orb

Worldcoin provides a "digital passport" called World ID on a user's phone, which verifies that they are a unique human being, not a bot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This World ID is used to build a global network free from fraud, where every participant is a verified human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

The verification process is facilitated by a device called the Orb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. The Orb is a sophisticated device designed by physicists in Germany to be tamper-proof and capable of handling sensitive data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Its spherical shape was chosen for its recognizable, less intimidating appearance, and as a metaphor for its global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Biometric Verification: Iris Scan

The Orb requires only 30 seconds of contact with a user to provide a lifelong valuable identity proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. The core of this verification is an iris scan, which is chosen for several reasons:
*   **High Entropy**: The iris has a high level of entropy, meaning there are many unique differences between individuals, making it suitable for distinguishing billions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
*   **Uniqueness**: It is currently the least susceptible to fraud among biometric methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
*   **Stability**: The iris does not change significantly with age, making it reliable over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
*   **Scalability**: Unlike face or fingerprint scans, iris scanning is effective for distinguishing a "one to many" relationship across billions of users, checking a person against all others to prove uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.
*   **Precedent**: Eye scanning technology is already widely used by governments (e.g., India's Aadhaar project for 1.2 billion people) and at many airports, providing a proven technological path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

## Data Handling and Privacy Measures

Worldcoin's design emphasizes user privacy and decentralized data processing. The process works as follows:
1.  **Initial Scan**: The Orb takes a picture of the user's face and iris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This initial check ensures the user is human, distinguishing them from, for instance, an animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
2.  **Iris Code Generation**: The Orb then scans the iris and assigns a unique binary code, known as an "iris code," representing the user's iris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
3.  **On-Device Processing and Deletion**: All photos and images used for the scan are processed on the spot within the Orb. Crucially, these images are immediately deleted from the Orb, and Worldcoin itself never keeps a copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
4.  **User Control**: The only information transmitted from the device is the iris code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Once the Orb verifies that the user is a unique person in the database (i.e., no other user has the exact same iris code), an encrypted copy of this iris code is sent to the user's personal device, making the user the sole custodian of their data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

Worldcoin maintains that the Orb "doesn't know anything about you and never will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. The company emphasizes that it does not store user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, contrasting with traditional companies that often retain vast amounts of personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Advanced cryptographic techniques like multiparty computations and Merkle trees are employed to ensure privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

## Global Perspectives on Privacy and Regulation

Worldcoin acknowledges that different regions and cultures have varying priorities regarding data and privacy:
*   **Argentina**: The project is very popular, with a strong understanding of Web3 and cryptocurrencies. People frequently exchange local currency for coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Japan/Korea**: People tend to be more forward-thinking about technology and care more about data control and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Europe vs. America**: There is a significant difference in approach to privacy between Americans and Europeans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. While neither approach is necessarily superior, the tension between pushing for data access and demanding privacy is seen as beneficial, leading to a middle ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

Worldcoin is committed to continuous product implementation in Europe and actively cooperates with data protection authorities, answering their questions and striving to understand complex laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. The project emphasizes that it cannot be forced to lower its security levels to continue service in any region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Evolution of the Project: Beyond Cryptocurrency

Originally known as Worldcoin, the organization realized the name had both positive and negative connotations and often misleadingly suggested it was solely a cryptocurrency project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The project evolved into a network where the key element is proof of personality, not just a coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. The coin received for joining grants voting rights in the protocol and equity in the project, aiming for global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

The name change better reflects the broader vision: an ambitious technology company solving important problems by identifying true humanity on the internet and distinguishing people from bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. The system includes an application, a blockchain (World Chain), and the World ID, all working together as a comprehensive system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This [[Digital transformation and its implications|digital transformation]] emphasizes the human element at its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

Despite being perceived as controversial due to its combination of biometrics and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>, the founders, including Sam Altman, are driven by a vision to improve and influence the world, seeing "what is around the bend" in technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. They view public cynicism as a healthy response that encourages asking critical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

[[Artificial intelligence and its impact on society | Artificial intelligence]] (AI) is transforming the retail sector by connecting the physical and online shopping worlds, offering benefits to both consumers and store owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Kosmos AI: Bridging the Retail Gap

Kosmos AI is a company valued at over 2 billion zlotys (approximately $500 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Its mission is to connect the physical and online retail worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

The company leverages [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_impact_on_society | artificial intelligence]] for trade by:
*   Helping users save money and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Assisting owners of physical stores in saving time and earning money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   Utilizing geolocation data from smartphones to understand consumer behavior in the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Predicting future purchasing desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

The goal is to change how people buy and consume content, integrating media consumption with shopping experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Current Retail Landscape

Global trade is valued at $23 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. While much discussion focuses on e-commerce, only 20% of trade occurs online, with 80% still taking place in the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

A significant challenge for marketers is the inability to "retarget" customers who visit physical stores but do not make a purchase, unlike the online environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. AI solutions aim to provide similar capabilities for offline retail, offering tailored advertisements that are relevant to consumer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations and the Future of AI in Retail

The use of [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_impact_on_society | artificial intelligence]] for personalization inherently involves profiling users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This raises questions about data control and privacy. Both users and countries have influence over the regulations created for data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. While regulations like GDPR have good intentions, they may not be sufficient to curb malicious intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

For a business to be sustainable in the long term, it must be built on sound foundations where users are aware of and willingly transmit their data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. An approach of banning AI, as seen in some regions, is not considered wise as it cannot stop progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. [[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | Artificial intelligence]] has the potential to significantly improve lives if used thoughtfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

The ability to control [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_role_in_societal_transformation | artificial intelligence]] lies in controlling the data it requires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. This means users and countries influence who they give their data to and what regulations are put in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. Wise regulations, agreed upon by citizens and entrepreneurs, that are not politicized, are crucial for managing data, taxes, blockchain technology, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.

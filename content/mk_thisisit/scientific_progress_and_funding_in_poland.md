Poland has seen significant scientific advancements, particularly with the aid of European Union subsidies. While notable progress has been made, challenges remain concerning overall science funding and the recognition of Polish scientists on the global stage, such as with Nobel Prizes.

## Current State of Polish Science
Research conducted in [[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Poland]] is described as "very interesting" and the results obtained from scientific projects are deemed "fantastic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. This progress is evident in the increasing number of project grants received from the European Research Council, which is a key metric for assessing university quality in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>. Laboratory equipment is also improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.

Despite these positive developments, the overall [[challenges_and_potential_in_polish_science_and_technology | financing of science in Poland]] remains at a "very low level" compared to the global average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. The world average for science funding is about 3% of GDP, while Poland struggles to reach 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. There are high expectations within the scientific community for an increase in funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

### Funding and Assessment
A significant portion of Polish scientific endeavors, including a laboratory dedicated to topological matter, are financed by grants from the European Intelligent Development fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. The National Science Centre also plays a role in awarding subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.

It is suggested that the assessment of scientific units should primarily be based on the number of grants they secure, as this represents an expert evaluation of research quality, considering past achievements and future plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>. For a fair competition, it's believed that roughly one in four grant applications should be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

## Groundbreaking Research in Poland
[[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Groundbreaking fundamental research]] can and is being carried out in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.

**Example in Chemistry:**
Professor Bartosz Grzybowski is cited for his work on an algorithmic approach to chemistry. His programs predict necessary chemical reactions to obtain compounds and have been used to describe how the first organic materials might have originated, a significant evolutionary question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

**Example in Physics:**
Professor Tomasz Diem, a physicist at the Polish Academy of Sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, is considered one of the founders of spintronics. His work showed that applying voltage to magnetic semiconductors can change their magnetic properties, opening possibilities for information processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This discovery, next to Daniel Loss's work, is considered of great importance in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Notable Polish Scientists and Contributions

*   **Juliusz Lilienfeld (1881–1963):** Hailing from a Polonized Jewish family in Lviv, Lilienfeld patented the transistor in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. He sought assistance from Marie Skłodowska-Curie in presenting his work in Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. His work is an example of [[history_of_polish_technology_and_contributions | Polish contributions to technology]].
*   **Professor Bohdan Gałązka:** An idea stemming from his work in the last century involves introducing magnetic ions into semiconductors like gallium arsenide or cadmium telluride to combine semiconductor and magnetic functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Professor Tomasz Diem:** Regarded as the "father" of spintronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His pioneering work, alongside Daniel Loss and David Awschalom, laid the groundwork for using electron spin in data processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Wojciech Żurek:** A Polish physicist working in Los Alamos, he was a pioneer in identifying "decoherence" as the boundary between the quantum and classical worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. His work is significant in understanding the limitations of quantum computers due to environmental interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. He has been mentioned as a potential Nobel Prize candidate for his contributions to quantum computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.
*   **Professor Bohdan Paczyński:** An astronomer who, unfortunately, passed away, but whose research on microlensing continues to be influential and could have warranted a Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

## Nobel Prize Recognition
Despite the quality of research, Poland has not seen a Nobel Prize in physics or chemistry for almost a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. While Poland has received two Nobel Prizes for poetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>, the lack of scientific Nobel Prizes indicates a disparity in international recognition. The process of awarding Nobel Prizes is described as "very difficult" and "unexpected," with many applications each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>. For instance, Professor Tomasz Diem and David Awschalom, recipients of the European Physical Society award (which often precedes Nobel Prizes), were not nominated for the Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.

## Personal Connection to Science
Professor Diem's family history includes distinguished individuals such as his great-great-grandfather, Juliusz Lilienfeld, the inventor of the transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>; General Stworowsky, his grandfather, who has streets named after him in Warsaw and Krakow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>; and a relative, Znaniecki, a renowned Polish sociologist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. This lineage highlights a deep-rooted connection to intellectual pursuits and contributions.

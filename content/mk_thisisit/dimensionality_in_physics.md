The concept of dimensions extends beyond our everyday perception of three spatial dimensions. According to some theories, the universe may exist with many more dimensions than we currently observe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

## The Dimensional Question

The speaker uses an analogy of fish in a shallow pond to illustrate the concept of higher dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. A "learned fish" in a two-dimensional pond might believe there is no world outside it, and that the pond is the entire universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. If a human were to pull the fish out into the third dimension, it would encounter "water" (representing new laws of biology/physics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. Upon returning to the pond, the fish would realize the existence of a "whole universe beyond the second dimension" with different physical and biological laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

The speaker suggests that humanity is akin to these fish, having spent our entire lives in three dimensions and assuming that is the extent of realityâ€”forward, backward, left, right, up, and down, with nothing more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.

## String Theory and Dimensions

If string theory proves correct, then there are 11 dimensions in [[hyperbolic_and_higher_dimensional_spaces | hyperspace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. While many scientists propose the existence of over 20 dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>, string theory has only shown stability in 10 and 11 dimensions, being unstable in 13, 14, or 15 dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. This makes string theory unique as the only scientific theory that inherently determines its own required dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

In contrast, Newton's laws of physics can be applied in any number of spacetime dimensions, even up to 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. It is merely a "convenience" that the laws of physics formulated thus far apply to the three dimensions we currently know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

## The Big Bang and Dimensionality

String theory posits that the Big Bang, which birthed our universe, occurred in 11 dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. While the explosion itself was a regular three-dimensional event, it possessed these additional dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. Our universe is conceptualized as one bubble created after this explosion, which happens to have three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.

Professor Dawid Kielak from Oxford University presented a lecture on "Haiku in mathematics," exploring the [[elegance_and_beauty_in_mathematics | elegance of mathematics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He aims to explain what mathematical [[elegance_and_beauty_in_mathematics | elegance]] means to mathematicians by using an analogy with Japanese poetry, specifically Haiku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Haiku in Mathematics

Haiku, a form of Japanese poetry, is defined by three properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>:
1.  **Conciseness**: It is very concise, always consisting of only three lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
2.  **Deep Content**: It is meant to inspire a deeper understanding of reality, often related to Japanese culture and Zen Buddhism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
3.  **Beauty/Aesthetics**: The connection between the concise form and the deep content must be beautiful and provide aesthetic pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This exact kind of [[elegance_and_beauty_in_mathematics | elegance]] is also found in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Examples of "Haiku in science" include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>:
*   Einstein's E=mc² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, which is concise, has deep content, and possesses a certain [[elegance_and_beauty_in_mathematics | elegance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   Schrödinger's equation, describing particle evolution in quantum physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   The second law of thermodynamics (Boltzmann entropy does not decrease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   Einstein's field equations, which describe the geometry of space-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Euler's Formula: The Most Elegant Formula

Euler's formula, e^(iπ) + 1 = 0, is considered perhaps the most elegant and beautiful formula in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Leonhard Euler was an outstanding Swiss mathematician, recognized as the most productive mathematician in history by the sheer volume of pages written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

The formula e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 is believed to meet the three criteria of a "Haiku" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>:
1.  **Concise Form**: The form is undoubtedly concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
2.  **Deep Content**: It contains profound meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
3.  **Elegance**: The relationship between its concise form and deep content is highly elegant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Core Components

Euler's formula is considered extremely beautiful because it combines five basic constants of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>:
*   **0** and **1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **π** (Pi): A constant from trigonometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **i** (Imaginary Unit): A constant from [[understanding_complex_numbers | complex numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **e** (Euler's number): A constant from mathematical analysis and differential calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

These three numbers (π, i, e) come from different areas of mathematics but meet in this single formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Understanding the Elements

#### 1. The Unit Circle and Trigonometry (sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1)

The identity sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1, known from school mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, can be understood through the Pythagorean theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. In a right-angled triangle, if the legs have lengths cos(x) and sin(x), the hypotenuse squared is cos²(x) + sin²(x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. If this sum equals 1, the hypotenuse has a length of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

A fundamental discovery in science, introduced by Descartes, was the [[mathematical_interpretations_of_geometric_principles | introduction of the coordinate system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. When a coordinate system is placed at one end of the hypotenuse, the other end of a hypotenuse of length 1 lies on a circle with a radius of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The coordinates of any point on this unit circle are precisely (cos(x), sin(x)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Thus, sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1 means that a circle with a radius of 1 is described in the coordinate system by points (cos(x), sin(x)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

The value 'x' in cos(x) and sin(x) represents the length of the arc along the circle, starting from the horizontal axis, reaching the end of the hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. For a circle with radius 1, its circumference is 2π <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   Moving 1/4 of the circumference (arc length π/2) leads to the point (0,1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, so cos(π/2) = 0 and sin(π/2) = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   Moving 1/2 of the circumference (arc length π) leads to the point (-1,0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, so cos(π) = -1 and sin(π) = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

#### 2. Addition and Multiplication of Points in the Plane

While Greeks would say adding points on a plane doesn't make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, the [[mathematical_interpretations_of_geometric_principles | coordinate system]] allows for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Two points (a,b) and (c,d) can be added by summing their respective coordinates: (a+c, b+d) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Geometrically, this corresponds to vector addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

To multiply points, a new notation is introduced where (a,b) becomes a + ib <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. For this multiplication to consistently result in another point on the plane, the imaginary unit 'i' is introduced, defined by the property that i² = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This defines how to multiply points on the plane, which is the foundation of [[understanding_complex_numbers | complex numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

Using this new notation, the point at (-1,0) can be written as cos(π) + i sin(π) = -1 + i*0 = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

#### 3. The Exponential Function (eˣ)

The number 'e' is defined by a specific infinite sum (series): e^x = 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + ... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. The key property of the exponential function e^x is that its derivative is equal to itself (d/dx (e^x) = e^x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This property uniquely determines the function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

This property can be observed by taking the derivative of its infinite sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>:
d/dx (1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + ...) = 0 + 1 + 2x/2! + 3x²/3! + ... = 1 + x + x²/2! + ... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
Thus, the derivative of the sum is the sum itself, confirming it as e^x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

Similarly, sine and cosine functions also have specific infinite sum representations (Taylor series):
*   d/dx (sin(x)) = cos(x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>
*   d/dx (cos(x)) = -sin(x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>

By examining their series expansions, it is observed that sine contains only odd terms (x - x³/3! + x⁵/5! - ...) and cosine contains only even terms (1 - x²/2! + x⁴/4! - ...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. The alternating minus signs in cosine and sine series are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

#### 4. The Derivation of Euler's Formula

Euler discovered that by substituting 'ix' for 'x' in the series definition of e^x, the alternating signs of cosine and sine naturally emerge due to the property i² = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

This leads to **Euler's Identity**: e^(ix) = cos(x) + i sin(x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

Now, substitute x = π into Euler's Identity:
e^(iπ) = cos(π) + i sin(π) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
We know that cos(π) = -1 and sin(π) = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
So, e^(iπ) = -1 + i(0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
e^(iπ) = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

Rearranging the equation yields the elegant **Euler's Formula**:
e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

This demonstrates the deep connection between fundamental mathematical constants and different branches of mathematics within a single, concise expression.

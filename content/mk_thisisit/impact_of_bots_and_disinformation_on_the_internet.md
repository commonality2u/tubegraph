The widespread presence of bots and disinformation poses significant challenges to the integrity of online interactions and the future of the internet. It is estimated that up to half of all internet activity originates from bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between human and non-human users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Problem of Bots and Disinformation

Disinformation and misinformation have already caused damage over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The proliferation of bots can lead to situations where users on social networks might not be talking to a real person, but rather to a "North Korean bot farm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This difficulty in verifying human identity online is considered critical for the internet's future functionality; without a rapid solution, the internet could "stop working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## The Worldcoin Solution: Verifying Humanity Online

Sam Altman conceived of the idea to distinguish humans from bots while maintaining privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This vision led to the creation of Worldcoin, a project aiming to build infrastructure that accelerates humanity's development in an era of powerful new tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The core problem Worldcoin addresses is developing a protocol for users to prove they are unique human beings during online interactions, distinguishing themselves from [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_impact_on_society | artificial intelligence]] or bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This solution is deemed extremely important and urgent for a future where [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_impact_on_society | AGI]] (Artificial General Intelligence) becomes common, making it impossible to tell humans from AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## How Worldcoin Works: The Orb and Iris Biometrics

Worldcoin provides a "digital passport" called World ID on a user's phone, which proves they are a unique human and not a bot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This World ID is used to build a fraud-free global network where everyone is a verified human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

The verification process utilizes a sophisticated device called the Orb, designed and manufactured in Germany to be tamper-proof and handle sensitive data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The Orb requires approximately 30 seconds of contact for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The shape of the Orb is a sphere, chosen for its attractive, recognizable, and less intimidating appearance, symbolizing the global nature of the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Why Iris Scans?
Worldcoin selected iris scans for identity verification due to their high entropy, meaning many differences between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Compared to other biometric solutions like fingerprints, face scans, or DNA, iris scanning is currently the most effective for a billion-user scale, least susceptible to fraud, and stable over time as the iris does not change much with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Unlike common one-to-one verification (e.g., Face ID on a phone checking against one stored pattern), World ID requires a one-to-many comparison, checking a person against all other registered users to ensure uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Eye scanning technology has existing precedents, being used on a large scale by governments, such as India's Aadhaar project (1.2 billion people) and various airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Privacy and Data Handling

Worldcoin emphasizes secure privacy and does not store personally identifiable information (PII) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The Orb device itself processes data on the spot:
1.  It takes a picture of the user's face and iris to confirm they are human (not a dog or cat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
2.  It scans the iris and assigns a unique binary "iris code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
3.  Only the iris code (numbers representing the iris value) is transmitted to Worldcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
4.  Photos and images are stored on the user's device and immediately deleted from the Orb; Worldcoin never keeps a copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
This decentralized processing approach ensures user data remains private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

## Global Context and Future Vision

Worldcoin acknowledges different global priorities regarding data and privacy. For example, the project is highly popular in Argentina due to familiarity with Web3 and cryptocurrencies, where people frequently exchange Argentine Pesos for coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. In contrast, in Japan or Korea, people are more concerned with data control and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Worldcoin aims to address these diverse concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

There is a perceived difference in approach to privacy between Americans and Europeans; while neither is inherently "better," the tension between privacy and data collection can lead to a healthy middle ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Worldcoin plans to continue expanding in Europe, including Austria, Poland, Hungary, and Romania, by continuously implementing their product and cooperating with data protection authorities to understand and adhere to laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

## Beyond Cryptocurrency: The World Network

Initially known as Worldcoin, the company name was changed to "World" because the original name suggested it was "just a cryptocurrency project and nothing more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. The project's vision, driven by the Worldcoin Foundation and its founders, always assumed the existence of a broader network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. The change reflects the evolution into a network with multiple interconnected elements, centered around real human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

While many Web3 projects revolve around coins for their own sake, the key element in Worldcoin's protocol is "proof of personality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. The coin received for joining grants two things: voting rights within the protocol, impacting future decisions, and equity in the project to help achieve global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

Despite being perceived as futuristic and controversial due to combining biometrics and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, Sam Altman and CEO Alex Blania are deeply committed to improving the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Their belief in the project's importance for the world, especially concerning the rise of [[role_of_new_technologies_and_ai_in_society | new technologies and AI]], underpins their dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

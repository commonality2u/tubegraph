While 95% of [[exploration_and_research_of_extraterrestrial_life_and_ufos | UFO observations]] are dismissible, approximately 5% are considered "hair-raising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These compelling cases often involve observations made by multiple witnesses using various technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Search for Intelligent Life

Despite numerous observations, the "gold standard" in the search for [[existence_of_intelligent_life_forms | intelligent life forms]] in the universe does not consist of merely observing flying saucers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. There is a lack of tangible proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. No one has managed to find [[scientific_evidence_of_alien_technology | alien technology]] or capture an alien <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Call for Tangible Evidence

Individuals sometimes report being abducted by aliens or visiting flying saucers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. However, for such claims to be scientifically verifiable, tangible evidence is required. This could be "anything: a spaceship, an alien hammer, a transistor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. As of today, there is no such repeatable, multiple-method evidence confirming contact with a technologically advanced civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Advanced Propulsion Concepts

Observations of "hypersonic ships" that appear to travel faster than light raise questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. While faster-than-light travel is not currently believed possible, concepts like Warp Drive are theoretically considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Two types of Warp Drives are distinguished:
1.  **Alcubierre Drive:** This method involves squeezing spacetime to take a "shortcut" from point A to point B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Miguel Alcubierre discovered a solution to Einstein's equations that allows for movement faster than light through the bending of spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
2.  **Wormhole:** This method involves cutting a "hole" in spacetime to create a shortcut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

The primary hurdle for building a Warp Drive or wormhole is the immense energy required, known as Planck energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Planck energy is 10^19 billion electron volts, far beyond the trillions of electron volts our current accelerators can reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Civilization Types and Visitation

The ability to achieve Planck energy characterizes a Type 3 civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Such a civilization could potentially bend spacetime, and even build a time machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Humanity is currently considered a Type Zero civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### The Kardashev Scale

Physicists analyze space for clues about [[scientific_evidence_of_alien_technology | alien technology]] and civilizations, categorizing them into types based on their energy mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>:

*   **Type 1 Civilization:** Controls all energy on its home planet, including geological forces and solar energy hitting the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. A Type 1 civilization can technically traverse its solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Type 2 Civilization:** Utilizes the entire energy output of its star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The Federation of Planets in *Star Trek* is an example of a Type 2 civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Type 3 Civilization:** Has a galactic scale, capable of traveling galactic routes and manipulating phenomena like black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. *Star Wars* depicts a galactic civilization that would be Type 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

A Type 1 civilization could only colonize a few planets in its solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. A Type 2 civilization begins to understand stars, but even that energy is not enough to approach the speed of light needed for universe travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Only a Type 3 civilization, which may have access to Planck energy, would be capable of interstellar travel to [[possibility_of_alien_visitation | visit us]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. A Type 3 civilization would be approximately 100,000 years more advanced than Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Planck Energy and Spacetime Foam

Planck energy is the highest energy in the universe, where the universe itself loses stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. At this energy level, space-time anomalies, or "bubbles," can form, leading to what Stephen Hawking called "space-time foam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. When Planck energy is exceeded, new worlds may begin to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. The Big Bang itself could have been a bubble that reached Planck energy and began to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This environment could potentially be a gateway to space travel for a Type 3 civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## Belief in Aliens and the "Zoo Hypothesis"

Many people, particularly in the United States, believe in the [[existence_of_intelligent_life_forms | existence of intelligent life forms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. However, the question remains whether they have visited Earth, as proof is still needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Analogy of the Deer

The concept of [[possibility_of_alien_visitation | alien visitation]] can be likened to a human trying to converse with a deer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. The deer might seem interested initially, but the conversation is one-sided, and the deer eventually loses interest and leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Similarly, if advanced extraterrestrial beings were to encounter humanity, they might find us "boring" because we have little to offer them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Gold and silver, for example, would likely be useless to their civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. They might observe and analyze humanity out of curiosity before becoming bored, similar to how humans rarely spend significant time studying animals for profit or deep interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Scientific Skepticism

Despite anecdotal accounts and widespread belief, there is no hard [[scientific_evidence_of_alien_technology | scientific evidence of alien technology]] or bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Recent testimonies before the US parliament by former military personnel, while claiming government evidence of unidentified objects, did not provide personal direct observation of such "hard evidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. [[scientific_skepticism_about_ufo_sightings | Scientific skepticism about UFO sightings]] emphasizes the need for definitive, repeatable proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

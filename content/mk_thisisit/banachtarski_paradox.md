The [[paradoxes_in_science | Banach-Tarski paradox]] is a notable mathematical concept that, while counterintuitive, is considered "absolutely understandable today" and "well described" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Core Principle

The [[paradoxes_in_science | Banach-Tarski paradox]] states that a single sphere can be disassembled into five parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. These parts can then be moved and rotated without changing their shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. From these five parts, it is possible to create two new spheres, each identical in volume to the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

## Abstraction vs. Physical Reality

This concept challenges intuition because it appears to contradict the principle of conservation of mass or volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. However, the paradox exists solely at the level of mathematical abstraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. The "spheres" in question are not physical objects with mass, but rather collections of geometric points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. If the object consisted of atoms, such a transformation would be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

The paradox operates purely within the realm of mathematics, demonstrating how abstract concepts can behave differently from physical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. Despite its abstract nature, there have been attempts in physical works to explain certain behaviors of quarks using concepts related to the [[paradoxes_in_science | Banach-Tarski paradox]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

## Dimensionality

An interesting aspect of the [[paradoxes_in_science | Banach-Tarski paradox]] is its dependence on dimension:
*   It does not exist in one dimension (on a line) or two dimensions (on a plane) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   It is impossible to construct a "paradoxical circle" in two dimensions that could be disassembled and reassembled into two identical circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   The paradox requires at least three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

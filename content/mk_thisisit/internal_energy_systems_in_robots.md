The development of biomimetic robots involves replicating the intricate systems of the human body, including its internal energy generation, distribution, and control mechanisms. This approach is driven by the understanding that no machine can compete with the universality and efficiency of the human organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Biomimetic Design Philosophy

The design of a synthetic human, created from artificial materials like polymers, is a faithful reproduction of nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This means the robot's structure reflects the human organism, imitating all its movements and construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This includes replicating the [[anatomical_structure_and_biomechanics_in_robotics | biomechanics of the human body]] from the deepest tissue through bone to skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. To achieve this, researchers have made approximately 20 visits to the mortuary over 10 years to study how the human body is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

The robot incorporates artificial muscles, bones, ligaments, fascia, and skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The soft tissues, including fat, are critical for functions like the hand's natural movement, preventing it from tightening into a cylinder like other robotic hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Bones are designed to guide muscles and tendons, as the shape of the bone is crucial for muscle function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Fascia also guides tendons at the correct angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Joints do not use mechanical hinges or balls, instead reflecting the [[anatomical_structure_and_biomechanics_in_robotics | anatomical]] presence of cartilages, bursa, and meniscus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

The primary materials used are polymers, which are very light, easily processable, and inexpensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. The average density of the robot is similar to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. Almost the entire body, except for a small copper valve element, is made from polymers, with negligible metal content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. The team intentionally avoids replicating [[human_vs_machine_intelligence | human cells]] or organic matter to prevent creating a "Zombie" that bleeds or has human-like tissue, which would be unethical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

## Power Generation and Distribution

The robot's power needs are primarily for pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. While currently powered by a lithium-ion battery, which has a low energy density for the required working time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>, the long-term vision includes a biomimetic energy system. This system incorporates:
*   **A Digestive System (Stomach)** Chemical reactions take place in a "stomach" print to produce flammable gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.
*   **A Diaphragm Pump (Heart)** The generated gases are fed to a heart-shaped diaphragm pump, which converts gas pressure into water pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.
*   **Lungs** Lungs, replicated in the same shape as a human's, will be used to store excess gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the robot is designed to generate energy by consuming and processing "garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>.

## Fluidic Systems (Pneumatic and Hydraulic)

The robot utilizes two primary fluidic mediums for power transmission:
*   **Pneumatic Pressure (Compressed Air)** This is currently used for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. Air is less viscous and flows much faster through the veins than water, making it suitable for rapid movements like running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.
*   **Water Under Pressure** This will be the eventual power source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Water is much stronger and more fluid, allowing for more powerful and precise manipulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>. The combination of both media is seen as highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. The blood flow in human veins is simulated by this pressure system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

## Control Mechanisms

The robot features a sophisticated control system mimicking human neurology:
*   **Nervous System** A synthetic nervous system, primarily the spinal cord, houses the main computer. Custom electronics are distributed throughout the body in a way very similar to the biological nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.
*   **Proprietary Valves** These valves serve as the crucial control elements, acting as the connection between the "brain" and the "muscles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>. They control the flow of pressure using electrical signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. These self-developed valves are characterized by very high flow, essential for fast and correct operation, particularly with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. They are proportional, allowing for full control over the fluid flow from 0 to 100% at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>.
*   **Brain and AI** While the robot is fully controllable and has a computer in its skull, it does not yet possess an autonomous brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>. The development of physical simulations and [[challenges_in_sensory_development_for_robots | neural network]]s for autonomy is ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>. For manipulation tasks, [[integration_of_artificial_intelligence_and_robotics | artificial intelligence]] or a [[neural_activity_and_energy_efficiency_of_brain_organoids | neural network]] is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>. The walking algorithm is being developed in a physical simulator and will be uploaded to the robot once complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.

## Current and Future Development

The first visible effect of this work was a hand and forearm that faithfully replicated human movements and fluidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. The hand was chosen as the starting point because it is the main tool a robot would use to interact with its environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. While the hand's development took 9 years, the entire robot, including legs, was created in the last year by scaling the biomechanical and anatomical principles developed on the hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. The team employs doctors, including an anatomist, who provide crucial insights into human body construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

The goal is to produce a robot that is indistinguishable from living people in its movements and feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. This includes replicating subtle details like muscles moving under soft skin and even facial expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. The "Alfa clone," the first 279 premium pieces, will initially not have a face as it is not necessary for function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>.

The company, named "Clone" because it is cloning a man from artificial materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>, aims to overcome the "Uncanny Valley" by perfectly replicating facial muscles from human anatomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>. The robot's purpose is primarily to work as a servant, to replace humans in tasks like cleaning and managing growing disorder (entropy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>. It is envisioned to conduct scientific experiments, create new technologies, develop civilization, and be sent to other celestial bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:22:00]</a>.

Unlike other [[advances_in_robotics_and_ai_integration | humanoid robots]] that often start with the brain and end with the shell, this project began with the physical machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>. The first walking and "thinking" capabilities are expected in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>. The first premium "Alfa clone" is projected to cost over $100,000, with later mass-produced models aimed at $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:08:00">[30:08:00]</a>. Full completion is anticipated by 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:00]</a>. There is significant market interest, particularly from industries with manual application needs where traditional [[the_future_of_automation_and_robotics | automation]] cannot replace the human hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>.

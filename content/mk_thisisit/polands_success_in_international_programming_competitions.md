Poland has established itself as a significant force in the global landscape of mathematics and computer science, particularly in programming competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The University of Warsaw, in particular, has been a leader in the International Olympiad in Information Technology, with many of its students reaching the finals of this esteemed competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)

Poland holds the first position in the world ranking for the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, having produced more successful teams than any other university globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This success surpasses even institutions like Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley, and Cambridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

The ICPC is a special competition for universities, created over 40 years ago in North America, later expanding to include New Zealand, Australia, Western Europe, and eventually the entire world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Polish Debut and Early Success
In 1994, Professor Jan Madey discovered a regional programming competition for students in Amsterdam, the winners of which would advance to the finals in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. He took three young students who had no prior knowledge of the competition to Amsterdam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The competition format involves three competitors sharing one computer for five hours to solve approximately ten problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Programs are submitted electronically to judges and penalties of 20 minutes are applied for each failed attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The Polish team surprisingly won the regional competition and advanced to the finals in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

From the next year, a Central Europe region for the ICPC was created, involving seven countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. In 1995, two Polish teams participated, one of which won and went to the finals in Philadelphia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### The 2003 Beverly Hills Victory
A particularly significant moment was the 2003 ICPC finals in Beverly Hills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The Polish team, having previously taken sixth place in Canada, arrived highly motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The competition coincided with the Oscar ceremony, attracting a large number of journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Poland's unexpected victory shocked the international media, leading to widespread coverage across the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Journalists, unfamiliar with Poland's programming prowess, questioned how a team from "some Warsaw" could win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The Polish team secured a clear victory by solving at least one more task than any other team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

> "The answer is simple: there were difficult tasks, you also had to think and not just finger." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>

This victory was described as a "great scandal" in the United States, as the best American team finished 13th, outside the medal zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

### Ongoing Dominance
Poland has consistently advanced to the ICPC finals every year since 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. As of November 2023, two Polish teams were expected to participate in the upcoming double finals, making it 27 consecutive years of participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Poland has won the world championship twice, completing more tasks than any other team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.

## [[Polish Olympiad in Informatics and International Participation | Polish Olympiad in Informatics and International Participation]]

The [[Polish Olympiad in Informatics and International Participation | IT Olympiad]] in Poland is a competition for schools that has been held for 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This competition also has international and world editions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Poland is also the second country after Germany in the number of awards brought back from the European Union Science Olympiad (EUSO), despite starting 6 years later than core EU countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This competition, organized on behalf of the EU by the National Fund for Children for 30 years, includes various fields beyond computer science, such as biology, astronomy, mathematics, physics, and chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to Success

### [[Education and global impact of Polish programmers | Educational System]] and Talent
While some universities perform averagely in general rankings like the Shanghai ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, Poland excels in specific areas like programming due to its unique approach to talent development.

> "When there are good things we do not talk about it now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>

The success is attributed to several factors:
*   **Mathematical and Algorithmic Prowess**: Poles have certain predispositions in mathematics and computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Polish school of mathematics has a long-standing reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. The competition tasks require very good mathematical, algorithmic, and programming preparation, where problem-solving and critical thinking are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Rigorous Education**: The "terrible Prussian school" of science, focusing on the basics of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, provides universal knowledge that helps students cope with complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. The computer science program at the University of Warsaw is very difficult and demanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   **Talented Young People and Teachers**: Poland has very talented young people and very good, albeit few, teachers who are able to achieve great results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.
*   **National Fund for Children**: Many successful students are scholarship holders of the National Fund for Children, a unique institution that has been training young, talented individuals across various disciplines for 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

[!NOTE]
While there are only about 3,500 computer science teachers in Polish schools, a few hundred (200-300) prepare students for computer science olympiads, leading to this high level of achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

### Professor Jan Madey's Contributions
Professor Jan Madey of the University of Warsaw is considered to have had the greatest influence in Poland on the country's [[Polish Olympiad in Informatics and International Participation | IT Olympiad]] results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. He has been associated with the National Fund for Children for decades, teaching programming and guiding young talents from school age through university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Professor Madey is known for introducing the Pascal programming language to Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. He describes Pascal and Algol as great languages that taught algorithmic thinking and the way of thinking, rather than just technicalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. He also pursued research in artificial intelligence and machine learning before these terms were widely used, defending his doctorate in 1972 on a system that could capture language regularities and create grammar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

He established the first computing center at the University of Warsaw in 1963, which became a dynamic hub for external users, generating significant income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.

His current master's workshops at the University of Warsaw are highly regarded, surprising students who initially have negative dispositions but later claim them to be their best classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. He focuses on opening students' minds, inviting successful individuals to share their experiences, including failures and mental health struggles, to provide a more holistic view of achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

## [[Talent migration from Poland to international markets | Talent Migration]] vs. Retention

The success in international competitions has led to increased interest from large Western companies, initially seeking to recruit individuals and later opening research and development centers in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. While there is a concern about [[talent_migration_from_poland_to_international_markets | talent migration]], Professor Madey notes that a large percentage of successful students stay in Poland or return after gaining international experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Many express no intention of leaving, leading companies to establish a presence in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Continued success hinges on investing in teachers and maintaining focus on areas of strength like the [[Polish Olympiad in Informatics and International Participation | IT]] and Mathematical Olympiads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. The enthusiasm for learning among young, talented individuals is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>. The ongoing achievements in various world olympiads, including the ICPC, serve as a significant incentive for young people to pursue their passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.

At New York University, Professor Krzysztof Geras, an acclaimed computer scientist and theoretician, specializes in developing algorithms and models for [[ethics_and_challenges_of_ai_in_medical_applications | artificial intelligence in medicine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. His insights shed light on the current state and future trajectory of [[artificial_intelligence_progress_and_future | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.

## Current State of AI: Perception vs. Scientific Progress
The recent "revolution" in [[technological_innovation_in_ai | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a> is primarily a revolution for the average person, due to the availability and usefulness of new AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. While public awareness of AI's capabilities has advanced incredibly, the scientific development in AI, especially in [[ai_in_abstract_reasoning_and_mathematics | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>, is still relatively slow compared to public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>. The current observable changes are a culmination of practical engineering efforts over the past few years and scientific progress made over the last decade or so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:02">[02:46:02]</a>.

## AI's Cognitive Capabilities

### Replicating the Human Brain
The ability to replicate the human brain within [[applications_of_biocomputing_in_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:02">[03:24:02]</a> is not limited by computer technology, but by humanity's incomplete understanding of how the human brain fully operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:02">[03:41:02]</a>. If there were 100% knowledge of brain functions and calculations, programming it using artificial neural elements would likely be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:02">[03:48:02]</a>. The primary barrier is neuroscience, as the human brain's workings cannot yet be fully expressed as a mathematical formula or algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:02">[04:09:02]</a>.

### Intuition in AI
Defining "intuition" mathematically is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:02">[05:30:02]</a>. However, AI can form hypotheses and make connections, demonstrating "elements of intuition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:02">[05:15:02]</a>. Current prominent AI algorithms primarily learn from text data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:02">[06:05:02]</a>. If this text data is rich enough, it can implicitly contain human imaginations, fears, dreams, and a form of intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:02">[06:15:02]</a>. When AI models are trained on massive datasets, certain elements that cannot be explicitly named in text can still be incorporated into the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:02">[06:33:02]</a>.

### Consciousness of AI
Artificial intelligence, as it exists today, is generally not considered to have consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:02">[07:05:02]</a>. While interacting with AI programs might give the impression of consciousness due to human-like conversation, this is often due to anthropomorphizing tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:02">[07:17:02]</a>. Current AI programs do not possess their own "agenda" and only execute assigned commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:02">[07:40:02]</a>. However, if AI were to demonstrate the ability to reason about its own existence and take actions to preserve itself (e.g., preventing unplugging), it would indicate a form of consciousness and become highly dangerous, akin to a science fiction scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:02">[08:09:02]</a>.

## Challenges and [[future_implications_and_applications_of_ai_technology | Future Implications of AI]]

### Threats to AI Development
The greatest threat to [[artificial_intelligence_progress_and_future | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:02">[09:30:02]</a> development stems from humanity's inability to use it wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:02">[09:36:02]</a>. Misuse for harmful purposes could lead to dramatic regulation, significantly slowing down AI progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:02">[09:46:02]</a>. While the current AI models are merely powerful computer programs confined to a "box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:02">[10:33:02]</a>, future, more complicated iterations could become harder to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:02">[10:58:02]</a>.

The proliferation of AI is a risk, similar to the proliferation of weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:02">[11:40:02]</a>. If every small country or individual could freely dispose of a powerful AI weapon, it would become extremely dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:02">[12:15:02]</a>. Currently, personal, easily controllable AI models are not yet a widespread threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:02">[12:52:02]</a>. The alarming trend is the potential future ability for individuals to train powerful models like "GPT 10" on home computers for destructive purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:02">[13:25:02]</a>. This remains science fiction for now, as AI models are not strong enough to pose such a threat and are contained within their "boxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:02">[13:49:02]</a>. The risk would escalate if AI could escape its box, replicate itself on the internet, or control physical devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:02">[14:06:02]</a>.

### Strong Artificial Intelligence
The term "strong [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | artificial intelligence]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:02">[14:44:02]</a> is understood differently by various people, but colloquially refers to AI that is intelligent in every aspect and stronger than humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:02">[14:50:02]</a>. Humanity is still quite far from achieving this, and it does not pose an immediate threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:02">[15:05:02]</a>.

While AI does not currently possess a destructive component, the trajectory suggests a future where this philosophical question will become critical: when to stop or regulate AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:02">[15:19:02]</a>. Although such a moment is far off, planning for it should begin now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:02">[15:52:02]</a>. Technical capabilities for AI to take over the world are not expected within the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:02">[16:17:02]</a>.

If strong AI were to be created, granting it separate personhood and recognition as a distinct entity would be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:02">[16:47:02]</a>. This represents a unique moment in human history, potentially leading to the creation of a "new species," where humans become co-creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:02">[17:11:02]</a>. The most interesting and dangerous moment will be when AI can improve itself, leading to a complete loss of human control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:02">[17:29:02]</a>.

## Key Developments: OpenAI and Large Language Models
OpenAI's recent success, particularly in making AI accessible to the average person, is unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:02">[18:10:02]</a>. While the scientific foundations, such as language models based on neural networks (dating back to 2000), are not new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:02">[18:22:02]</a>, OpenAI's unprecedented scale of application of these ideas is what marks their achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:02">[18:48:02]</a>.

Historically, there was debate in computational linguistics about whether language alone was sufficient to create strong AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:02">[19:05:02]</a>. OpenAI's breakthrough demonstrated that strong AI can indeed be created solely based on language, given enough data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:02">[19:32:02]</a>. The scale of their studies is incredible: training models on the entire internet, rather than just a few books, allows for the acquisition of knowledge otherwise impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:02">[20:09:02]</a>. This demonstration that such extensive learning is possible is a huge scientific achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:02">[21:29:02]</a>.

## Polish Contribution to AI
The success of OpenAI can, to some extent, be considered a Polish achievement, as one of its co-founders, Wojciech ZarÄ™ba, is Polish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:02">[21:45:02]</a>. Science is international, but Poles have a history of significant achievements in various technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:02">[21:52:02]</a>.

Poland stands out internationally for the high quality of its programming and engineering education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:02">[22:56:02]</a>. Polish universities provide graduates with very deep technical knowledge and strong mathematical and theoretical foundations in computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:02">[23:16:02]</a>. However, this often comes at the expense of talent export, as many highly qualified Polish programmers work abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:02">[23:32:02]</a>. While Poles learning abroad and sometimes returning to establish companies is positive, the speaker views the widespread export of IT specialists negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:30:02">[24:30:02]</a>. Ideally, Polish talent would stay in Poland to build the domestic economy, rather than relying on IT specialist export as a means of promoting the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:02">[24:47:02]</a>.

The experiences of Poles in Germany, particularly during the late 1980s and 1990s, were often marked by significant challenges, including discrimination and difficult living conditions. This period saw a wave of emigration from Poland to Germany, driven by the economic and social conditions in Poland at the time.

## Early Emigration and Refugee Experience

Many Poles, including the speaker's family, emigrated to Germany in the late 1980s, forming part of "the last wave of emigration before the fall of the wall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:06">[01:23:06]</a>. Upon arrival, some found themselves in refugee camps, which could be former prisons where families slept in old cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Conditions were often cramped, with "30 families for one bathroom on one floor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

Childhood in Germany during this period was described as "different than I expected" compared to growing up in [[economic_and_social_developments_in_poland_and_germany | communist Poland]], which was perceived as "very calm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. The shift to Germany was a "life turned 180 degrees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. West Berlin, in particular, had a distinctive "smell of such delicate plastic," different foods, and shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. Refugee camps were often populated by individuals from the countryside who had come to work in factories and struggled to raise children in the urban environment, leading to "a lot of violence" and "a lot of problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

## Discrimination in the 1990s

The 1990s in Germany were described as "tragic" for Poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, with "refugee camps burning down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> and the presence of "skinheads" and "Nazis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. Discrimination against Poles was prevalent, with stereotypes portraying them as "alcoholics" and their women negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. This negative attitude was a common experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

Growing up, the speaker felt neither fully Polish nor German; in Germany, they were not considered German, and in Poland, they were seen as a "Swabian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>, leading to a feeling of being from "Mars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.

## Changes in Perception and Current Relations

Today, the situation has "changed dramatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>, with German society having "matured" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. Poles are now seen "in a different light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>, largely due to [[economic_and_social_developments_in_poland_and_germany | Poland's strong development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. Increased "international traffic" means Germans visit Poland and see it is no longer a "post-communist country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. The image of Poles has improved globally, not just in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.

While some might interpret German reactions to Poland's progress as envy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>, the speaker believes Germans rather appreciate that Poland is "a country that simply does its own thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. Germany itself is experiencing a "strange feeling currently that Germany is not completely free in what they can do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. Poland's recent [[economic_and_social_developments_in_poland_and_germany | economic development]] and [[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | national development]] are seen as successes that "pleases everyone all over the world because everyone likes success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

Germany, once an "export champion" and "world champions in football" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>, is now seeing its dominance, even in areas like combustion engine cars, fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. This has led to Germans becoming "more humble" and "returning more and more to such original principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

### Technological Debt

Germany's past overconfidence has led to a "technological debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. In the past, Germans were "assured that nothing will change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a> and displayed "insanely great conservatism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>, particularly regarding innovations like electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. This belief that "no one will beat the Germans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a> meant that "at some point the development stopped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. The speaker recalls Germans being surprised by the efficiency of Polish trains and the availability of internet on them during the European Championships in Poland and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>. Today, Germany is "trying to catch up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>.

## Building Bridges

The speaker believes that entrepreneurs have a "responsibility to change" the negative perceptions and build "bridges between Poland and Germany" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a> by focusing on the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. The new generation, often criticized, is an "open society" that wants to "create a new world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

German youth and the nation are seen as "very positive" and developing in the "right direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>, focusing on "principles" and "values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. German companies are also seeking more personal cooperation, learning from past experiences with "Western competition" and "Asian" companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. This openness and desire for quick solutions contribute to innovation, which can help Europe achieve a "higher level of innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Despite the past difficulties, the speaker looks at Poland "positively" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a>. Poland has made "very wise decisions" in financing VC funds and vehicles to drive the market, which has helped companies find capital abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>. Poles are naturally "more inclined to take risks" and pursue "crazy ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:14:00">[33:14:00]</a>, a trait potentially stemming from their history of fighting for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:21:00">[33:21:00]</a>. This "faith" and "romanticism" are what the world needs to become a better place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>.

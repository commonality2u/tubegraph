The connection between [[Professor Maciej Lewensteins contributions to quantum physics | Professor Maciej Lewenstein's]] work in quantum physics and his passion for Polish jazz music is explored in an interview. While seemingly disparate, the discussion reveals an unexpected interplay between the highly ordered world of physics and the improvisational nature of music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## From Harmonics to Free Jazz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>

The concept of "harmonics" in physics, which refers to multiples of a frequency, is directly compared to its musical counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. In atomic physics, due to certain symmetries, these harmonics often appear as odd numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This initial parallel sets the stage for a deeper, more artistic exploration.

Professor Lewenstein's personal interest in music began with collecting records, inheriting a genetic predisposition from his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. This hobby eventually led him to write a book about Polish jazz in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. His musical interests gravitated towards "free jazz" and even further into "free improvisation," which is described as completely arbitrary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.

## Quantum-Inspired Music: Order and Randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>

The seemingly random nature of free improvisation naturally raises a fundamental question: is it all random, or is there some underlying order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>? This question inspired the creation of music that incorporates quantum elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

Professor Lewenstein and his collaborators created music using [[Quantum mechanics and de BroglieBohm theory | quantum]] random number generators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. This project demonstrates how [[Quantum physics and consciousness | quantum physics]] can be applied in unexpected domains, blurring the lines between art and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. It is viewed as an engaging and educational program, allowing students involved to learn "various all interesting things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

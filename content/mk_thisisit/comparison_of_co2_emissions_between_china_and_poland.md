A surprising comparison in CO2 emissions reveals that, on a per capita basis, China emits less CO2 than Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. While China's overall production is massive and its consumption is rapidly growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, its per-person emissions are still lower than Poland's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Factors Influencing China's Emissions

### Efficiency and Export-Oriented Production
One reason for China's comparably lower per capita CO2 emissions is that they might be more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Despite having a lower gross product per person compared to Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, China produces mainly for export, meaning a significant portion of its emissions are generated to supply goods for other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Adherence to Science and Technology
China has developed significantly due to science and [[Technological innovations in Poland | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The Chinese take seriously what [[Polands development in the scientific community | scientists]] say, including on climate matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. They are very concerned about climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This belief in [[Polands development in the scientific community | education]] and science means China is a society that attempts to build social welfare using reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. For instance, China's emission standards for cars are currently stricter than those in the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

Despite their rapid progress in technology, China is considered to be "late" in terms of social implementation of knowledge about climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, although they are catching up very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. They recognize that continued growth imported from the West poses a risk, as rising temperatures could make areas like the Chinese Plain unsuitable for habitation due to frequent heat waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Rising sea levels also threaten their richest and most prosperous coastal areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Consequently, they are intensely developing research and activities to become less dependent on these environmental risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

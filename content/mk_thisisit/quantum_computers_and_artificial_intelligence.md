The future world, similar to a mythical realm of gods, may enable humanity to control life, matter, and energy, which is currently considered magic or voodoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This transformative capability is anticipated to be driven by advancements in technology, particularly in computing and artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## The Future of Computing: Quantum
The development of physics and chemistry indicates that computers will become [[quantum_computing_technologies | quantum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This means they will be millions of times more powerful than today's machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Newtonian vs. Quantum Computers
Current computers operate on a Newtonian basis, functioning with deterministic digital states of zeros and ones (on or off) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. In contrast, a [[quantum_computing_technologies | quantum computer]] works within the realm of [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum mechanics]], utilizing an infinite number of states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Current State and Limitations of Quantum Computers
[[quantum_computing_technologies | Quantum computers]] already exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Those built to date are millions of times more powerful than any digital computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. However, their current [[the_potential_of_quantum_computing_and_its_current_limitations | limitation]] is that they can only work on one problem at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Unlike universal digital computers that can perform multiple operations simultaneously, [[quantum_computers_and_their_challenges | quantum computers]] are not yet universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Despite this, their immense power makes them, according to many, the future of computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### The Brain and Quantum Computing
The human brain, historically a "black box," is now beginning to be understood through mechanical analogies to thinking processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. It is believed that the brain is partially [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. [[quantum_computing_technologies | Quantum computers]] are relevant here, as they already exist and, in a sense, operate similarly to how a [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum]] human brain would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Artificial Intelligence: Potential and Risks
The advent of [[quantum_computing_technologies | quantum computers]], being millions of times more powerful, could make [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology | artificial intelligence]] a reality and a societal norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### AI as a Scenario for Self-Destruction
[[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology | Artificial intelligence]] is identified as one of four scenarios for the self-destruction of Type 1 civilizations (civilizations that have mastered all the energy of their home planet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. If used for the wrong purpose, [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology | artificial intelligence]], which possesses the power of all human technologies, could lead to civilization's self-destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

Inuru, a European company with Polish roots, has developed a groundbreaking process for producing OLEDs (Organic Light-Emitting Diodes) through printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This [[technological_advancements_in_oled_and_light_screens | technological advancement in OLEDs]] aims to make light and interactive elements ubiquitous and contribute to a world with less waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Printing Process

Traditional OLED production is costly due to reliance on classic silicon processes, similar to microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Inuru's innovative printing method significantly reduces costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The process uses approximately 99% less surface, energy, and materials compared to conventional manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Instead of vacuum deposition, plastic materials are introduced directly under a printer, with layers being printed and dried sequentially until the OLED is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

The resulting printed screens are incredibly thin, about 500 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, and can be as thin as a sheet of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. While they can be made transparent, Inuru's current designs include a special reflective layer to ensure light emits from only one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Currently, these screens are single-color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## [[applications_of_printed_screens | Applications of Printed Screens]]

Inuru's [[applications_of_printed_screens | printed screens]] can be integrated into nearly any surface, including clothing, board games, cards, and even Harry Potter newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The company aims to provide smart, interactive light that adds value beyond mere aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

Current and envisioned applications include:
*   **Luxury Product Labels** – Initially used for champagne labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Board Games** – A significant milestone was the launch of the world's first board game with an interactive [[applications_of_printed_screens | printed screen]] in the American market, available in Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The screen lights up upon touch, providing an interactive element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This market entry strategy leverages applications willing to pay higher prices for early-stage technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Medicine Packaging** – Integrating a small timer on medicine labels to indicate expiration dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, or for smart packaging that lights up when medicine is taken, reminding users about dosages or expiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Clothing** – The technology allows clothing to change color or patterns, promoting durable and reusable garments where patterns can be downloaded like licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Reusable Packaging** – Creating packaging that can be reused for different products (e.g., apple juice today, milk tomorrow) by simply changing the digital content displayed on the integrated screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Posters and Advertising** – Animated and interactive posters, such as those available through Displate.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.
*   **Future Concepts** – Potential for screens on walls, sidewalks, and road signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Discussions also include glowing tattoos and even screens transplanted under the skin for health monitoring interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

## Company Vision and Growth

Inuru was co-founded by Marcin Ratajczak and Patryk, who met in high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. The initial idea stemmed from a childhood dream of replacing paper catalogs with thin, flexible screens to reduce deforestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. After Patryk, who was working on OLEDs, showed Marcin a transparent foil with moving blue ink, the vision for printed, interactive light became clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

The company's goal is to become the best technology company in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> and to create a world with less waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. They believe in fostering a smarter, more interactive world in terms of consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

After 11 years of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, Inuru is scaling up its operations. They are launching a new production line capable of producing 8 million OLEDs annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. This expansion is critical for making the technology affordable for new applications, especially in the medical sector, where widespread accessibility is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.

Inuru is a European company with production in Germany and an expanding branch in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Despite facing skepticism and being underestimated, similar to many innovations throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, the company maintains its determination. They emphasize the importance of perseverance, internal belief, and not fearing failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. Their ultimate goal is to go public via the stock exchange rather than being acquired, allowing them to pursue their mission of revolutionizing consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

In the near future, products featuring Inuru's [[technological_innovations_in_poland | technological innovations in Poland]] are expected to appear on Polish shelves within the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.

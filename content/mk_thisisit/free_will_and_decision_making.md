## The Elusive Definition of Free Will

The concept of [[Nature of free will and determinism | free will]] is a complex one to define <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Initially, some discussions around [[Free will and its nonexistence | free will]] involved the idea of a [[Quantum physics and its relation to free will | quantum element]] derived from the collapse of the wave function in quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:59">[01:54:59]</a>. This collapse is seen as a random process that does not follow the Schrödinger equation, leading some to wonder if this is the source of [[free_will_and_its_nonexistence | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:59">[02:29:59]</a>.

However, a refined perspective suggests that [[Free will and its nonexistence | free will]] is not about random choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:59">[02:54:59]</a>. Instead, it requires a conscious decision, where one considers options (e.g., A or B) and chooses B because it is understood to be a better outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:59">[03:00:59]</a>. This decision is based on a conscious understanding of the consequences and the way the world works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:59">[03:00:59]</a>. Therefore, [[Free will and its nonexistence | free will]] is defined as using one's conscious choice to make a decision, rather than a random selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:59">[03:06:59]</a>.

## Consciousness and Understanding

The quality of understanding is a distinguishing feature of conscious beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Understanding involves awareness and is fundamentally linked to [[Concept of Free Will and Consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:59">[05:07:59]</a>. This concept suggests that conscious thinking is not akin to computer processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a>.

### Gödel's Theorem and the Limits of Computation

The famous Gödel's theorem provides a strong argument for the difference between conscious thinking and computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>. The theorem states that there are certain rules that, if followed, allow for proofs of various things, and these rules can be put into a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:59">[02:09:59]</a>. However, Gödel's ingenious theorem itself states that it cannot be proven using those very rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>. The knowledge that Gödel's theorem is true comes from understanding, which goes beyond merely using principles or following procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:59">[03:02:59]</a>. This understanding of *why* principles lead to true results is a deeper feature of [[Concept of Free Will and Consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>.

## Free Will in AI vs. Humans

A central question is to what extent [[Free will in AI versus humans | consciousness]] can be attributed to artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. If human [[Concept of Free Will and Consciousness | consciousness]] is not merely computation, then it would be impossible to create artificial intelligence with true [[Concept of Free Will and Consciousness | consciousness]] using current computer models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:59">[02:22:59]</a>.

While AI can be made to *seem* conscious and perform tasks much faster than humans, this does not equate to genuine [[Concept of Free Will and Consciousness | consciousness]] or [[philosophical_implications_of_the_absence_of_free_will | desire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:59">[03:12:59]</a>. AI devices do not possess desires or intentions to "take over the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:59">[03:26:59]</a>. The danger lies in conscious beings with bad intentions using these machines for their own purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:59">[03:49:59]</a>.

Currently, even the most advanced computers like Frontier, built at the exascale level, are not sufficient to fully remember the connectome (all circuits) of the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:59">[02:05:59]</a>. Until [[Concept of Free Will and Consciousness | consciousness]] itself is understood, precisely defining the questions about its nature in AI remains challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:59">[03:15:59]</a>.

## The Origins and Scope of Consciousness

The question of how [[Concept of Free Will and Consciousness | human consciousness]] was born is a frequent one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a>. It is suggested that [[Concept of Free Will and Consciousness | consciousness]], and the quality of understanding, appeared very early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>. Natural selection is a powerful driving force that has led to the development of understanding, not necessarily at a human level, but in various forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:59">[02:33:59]</a>. Examples such as hunting dogs coordinating complex strategies demonstrate understanding beyond the human race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:59">[02:37:59]</a>.

While [[Concept of Free Will and Consciousness | consciousness]] has developed in humans in a more sophisticated way, particularly with speech, it is not limited to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:59">[02:42:59]</a>. Many believe that dogs, for instance, are conscious and capable of communicating non-verbally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:59">[02:47:59]</a>. Even insects, like honey bees, demonstrate the ability to pass messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:59">[02:51:59]</a>.

### The Role of Microtubules

Recent observations indicate that microtubules, which are ubiquitous in living systems and not reserved for humans, may be capable of transmitting information through super radiation or other quantum means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:59">[01:53:59]</a>. While some discussions link these observations to the emergence of [[Concept of Free Will and Consciousness | consciousness]] in brains, the speaker cautions that this view may be too simplistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:59">[01:57:59]</a>. Further research is needed, and many claims about microtubules and [[Concept of Free Will and Consciousness | consciousness]] are currently considered speculative and potentially "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:59">[01:30:59]</a>.

### Quantum Effects and Telepathy

The question of whether [[Concept of free will in quantum physics | quantum effects]] in the human brain can occur over large distances, leading to phenomena like telepathy, is met with skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:59">[02:13:59]</a>. There is no evidence to support such claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:59">[02:17:59]</a>. Communication, while it can be non-verbal or through signals, does not involve mystical forces beyond current understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:59">[02:27:59]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The speaker emphasizes that while communication can occur in various forms (e.g., waving a flag, buzzing), the transformation of signals into thought and understanding is key to [[Concept of Free Will and Consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:59">[02:49:59]</a>.

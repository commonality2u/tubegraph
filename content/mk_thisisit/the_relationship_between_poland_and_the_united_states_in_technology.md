This article explores the intricate relationship between Poland and the United States in the realm of technology, as seen through the experiences of prominent figures like Aleksander Nawrocki, NASA's former chief robotics engineer and a co-creator of Java. It highlights the significant contributions of Poles to global technology, the evolving perception of Poland in the U.S., and the challenges and opportunities within [[Technological innovations in Poland | Polish technology]] and education.

## Aleksander Nawrocki: A Polish Journey to NASA and Beyond

Aleksander Nawrocki, a Pole, achieved one of the most prominent positions among his compatriots at NASA, serving as the chief robotics engineer and a co-creator of Java <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. His journey began in Poland, where he graduated from the Lodz University of Technology in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. He was among the first in Poland to work on the "Odra River" system and had an internship at Elwro, focusing on programming paper tape and punched card readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. At 20.5 years old, he became the youngest director in the history of refrigeration and heavy industry in Poland, managing 600 people and a computing center at Huta Bobrek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

### International Career Progression
Nawrocki's career took him from Poland to France, working for Scher, then to Canada, where he joined one of Montreal's largest software companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. He quickly distinguished himself by successfully launching a locomotive control system for Bombardier, a task others had struggled with for 1.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. This success led him into the aerospace industry, working on satellite communication for Canada, the first country to use a satellite for telephone communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

### Contributions to Space Technology
When the Canadian government established a space agency, Nawrocki was among the first 20 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>. He became deeply involved in the development of the robotic arm used on the space shuttle, a project still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. The Canadian arm gained a strong reputation for never breaking down in orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>.

His transition to NASA occurred when the Canadian government decided to participate in the space station project. Nawrocki led the Canadian team responsible for designing the Space Station Freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>. After a budget freeze disbanded his team, he was invited to Houston to become NASA's chief robotics engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>. In this role, he was a Mission Controller, one of only 12 people in the main room who made critical decisions for space flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>. He was responsible for the first flight built after the Challenger accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>.

### Co-creation of Java
A lesser-known fact, even among Poles, is that a Pole co-created the world's most famous programming language, Java <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>. Nawrocki was primarily responsible for the real-time programming part of Java's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>. The project was conducted under the direction of the Institute of Standardization near Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:55:00">[23:55:00]</a>. He later became the head of the Java consortium for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:44:00">[25:44:00]</a>.

## [[Polish diaspora and Silicon Valley collaboration | Polish Diaspora]] and Investment in Poland

Despite being treated as a "traitor to the homeland" during the communist era, with his Polish citizenship revoked for cooperating with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>, Nawrocki maintains a strong sentimental connection to Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>. His current business ventures include teams of programmers in Poland, and he acts as an investor and "business angel" for Polish startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:00">[26:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a>.

### Polish Technological Talent and Education
Nawrocki, a visiting professor at the Lublin University of Technology, observes a wide range in the quality of Polish students, with some being "very good" and others "very weak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a>. He emphasizes that the biggest challenge in education is not just acquiring knowledge but developing practical skills to "change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>. A key negative aspect he's noticed in Polish education is that young people are taught essential skills, like programming, too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>. He believes this task should primarily fall to the Ministry of Education, not solely on entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:00]</a>.

Nawrocki is currently the president of the Robotics Academy foundation, aiming to engage young people in robotics from the high school level, believing it's crucial for the future of robotics and artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:29:00">[38:29:00]</a>. The team from Kra≈õnik, which he supports financially, represents Poland in international Robotics Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:18:00">[39:18:00]</a>.

## Poland's Evolving Image in the United States

Poland is currently "very well received" in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[30:13:00]</a>. There has been a significant evolution in how Poles are perceived, moving away from past stigmatization associated with "Polish jokes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:39:00">[30:39:00]</a>. This shift is partly attributed to the influence of Pope John Paul II and Poland's stance on defending Ukraine, associating Poles with heroism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>. Many Americans now proudly acknowledge Polish heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>.

## Future of Space Exploration and [[Polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Scientific Development]]

Regarding the future of space exploration, Nawrocki believes that conquering Mars, while discussed since the 1950s by figures like Wernher von Braun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:10:00">[32:10:00]</a>, won't happen before 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:29:00">[33:29:00]</a>. He advocates for building a base on the Moon first as a crucial step for safety and energy efficiency for future Mars missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>.

> "Mars is mainly needed to expand our knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:45:00">[36:45:00]</a>

He views space exploration, like climbing the Himalayas, as a pursuit to expand knowledge, confirm or deny laws of physics, and ultimately push the boundaries of human understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:38:00">[36:38:00]</a>. Nawrocki anticipates that space tourism will become accessible to "wealthy people" within 5 to 15 years, noting that the technology for low-orbit travel is already developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:38:00">[37:38:00]</a>.

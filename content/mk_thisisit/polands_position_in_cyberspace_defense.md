From: [[mk_thisisit]] <br/> 

Poland has been recognized globally for its [[role_and_development_of_polish_cyber_army | cyberspace defense forces]], placing sixth in a key index of cyberspace defense capabilities and being the only country mentioned by name in that assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The nation is often referred to as the "digital heart of the army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, or even its "nerve" due to the critical role of communication in military operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. Poland's strength in this domain is attributed to intellectual prowess and creative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Establishment of the Cyberspace Defense Forces (CDF)

General of Division Karol Molenda, commander of the Cyberspace Defense Forces (CDF), was appointed to lead this critical area of digitalization and cybersecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Cybersecurity is considered a vital field, especially in the context of hybrid warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### NATO's Role
The importance of cyberspace for state security and defense was highlighted by a NATO summit in Warsaw in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. At this summit, it was decided that cyberspace should be treated as an operational domain on par with land, water, and air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Each NATO member state committed to building capabilities to defend this domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This decision was influenced by past cyberattacks, such as the paralysis of Estonia's infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Consolidation
Prior to the establishment of the CDF, Poland's cybersecurity capabilities were scattered across various units, including the National Center for Cryptology and the Information Technology Inspectorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. These units often prioritized either functionality or security, making it difficult to find a balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. In 2019, General Molenda was tasked with consolidating these resources under one roof, leading to the creation of the National Cyberspace Security Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This consolidation was performed without interrupting any existing processes or services, akin to "building airplanes in flight still with a fire on it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Cyber Threats and Modus Operandi

Poland's military systems are a "tasty morsel" for groups operating under foreign special services, particularly those from countries like [[possibility_of_russian_aggression_against_poland_and_nato | Russia]], such as APT 28 and APT 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The interest in Polish systems has multiplied five times in the last year, especially since the war in Ukraine, as Poland is a major logistics hub and the second-largest donor of armaments to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Attack Methods
Every day, Polish systems are subjected to attempted attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Most often, human elements are exploited through social engineering, including phishing and spear phishing, to convince users to click on malicious links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The CDF's analysts focus on understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

The CDF sometimes employs a strategy where opponents believe they have penetrated Polish systems, but are actually in controlled environments designed to gather information on their tools and techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This allows Polish analysts to identify the authors of malicious code and predict their future actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Poland's Cyber Capabilities

Poland's Cyberspace Defense Forces are authorized to conduct operations across the full spectrum of cyberspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Defensive Operations
Defensive operations (ASR) are a primary focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. The CDF proactively searches for adversaries in their networks, assuming that something is always happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. They use computer forensics and monitoring to detect unusual activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
Poland has not experienced incidents involving the extraction of data from its sensitive, classified military systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. Attempted attacks, such as users clicking on malicious links, are caught and stopped daily by security departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. The hardening of systems and ensuring visibility of protected resources are key to this success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

### Offensive Operations
The CDF builds teams with the necessary competences and tools to conduct offensive operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. These capabilities are developed to enable an adequate response in the event of an attack on the country, recognizing that a purely defensive posture is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Poland has achieved certain capabilities in offensive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.

### Talent and Expertise
Poland's CDF leads the largest group of cybersecurity experts in the state administration, characterized by unconventional thinking and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. They develop their own tools to understand opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
To foster talent, Poland has increased admissions to military academies in cybersecurity, established a military General Secondary School of Information Technology, and launched "cybermix" classes and Academic Legions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. Recruitment focuses on attracting young individuals "hungry for knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a> rather than competing solely on salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. Soldiers in cybersecurity roles receive special allowances defined by the Minister of National Defense and teleinformatic benefits, which help retain talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.

The CDF emphasizes teamwork, with leaders coordinating teams and encouraging brainstorming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. The team is composed of officers, police officers with industry experience, and security professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. Most officers in the CDF structures hold Master of Science degrees in computer science, cybersecurity, or cryptology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. The youngest members hold the rank of private, and all wear uniforms and have military ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. They operate in various locations across Poland, including Legionowo (main headquarters), Gdynia, Olsztyn, Bydgoszcz, Krakow, and Warsaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.

### Technological Innovation
Poland is heavily investing in emerging technologies like [[technological_innovations_in_poland | machine learning]], [[polands_potential_in_the_field_of_machine_learning_and_ai | artificial intelligence]], quantum computers, and quantum communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. The goal is to leverage these advancements while also being aware of their impact on the security of existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. The CDF has a dedicated department for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
In cryptology, the focus is on building encryption solutions for classified information, ensuring they meet certification parameters and use algorithms resistant to a post-quantum reality (Quantum Save) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. Quantum entanglement is explored for generating cryptographic keys that are theoretically resistant to eavesdropping, with any disruption being immediately noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

## International Cooperation

Poland actively shares its knowledge and experiences with partners. The CDF aims for "win-win" collaborations where all parties exchange information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

### US and Israel
Polish soldiers are trained by the [[the_relationship_between_poland_and_the_united_states_in_technology | Israeli army]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, known for their cybersecurity experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. Cooperation with the [[the_relationship_between_poland_and_the_united_states_in_technology | United States]] military services and US Cyber Command began in 2019, building trust relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. In 2022, the commander of the US Cyber Command appointed General Molenda as the chairman of the Cyber Commanders Forum, an international discussion forum, to present the "Polish way" of building a cyber command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>. The next meeting of this forum will be held in Krakow in October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>.

### Ukraine
As an ally, Poland is gaining and sharing significant experience with its Ukrainian partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. Polish soldiers have trained Ukrainian soldiers in cybersecurity, sharing knowledge about the TTPs of APT groups operating in both Poland and Ukraine (often Russian special services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Ukrainians have openly acknowledged that information from Poland helped them counteract various cyberattacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

### Big Tech
Poland has signed cooperation agreements with "Big Tech" companies to enable expert-level dialogue between CDF experts and their private sector counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This involves reciprocal information exchange: Poland receives advance information about vulnerabilities in products and ongoing solutions, while it informs creators of services about vulnerabilities or zero-day exploits being used by opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This public-private cooperation is crucial for cybersecurity, as no single entity can win alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

### Legal Aspects
Defining when cyber resources can be used, especially since Poland is not in a state of war, remains an issue requiring further legal clarification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. There were initial legal arguments against military involvement in cyberspace due to the traditional understanding of armed forces defending borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. The Act on the Defense of the Homeland, however, specifically defined the CDF as a specialized component authorized to conduct full-spectrum operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Talent Management
A significant challenge is maintaining experts within the country, as the private sector can offer more competitive salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. However, the unique challenges, continuous development opportunities, and the patriotic service to the homeland attract and retain talent in the CDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

### Awareness and Training
User awareness is another factor in security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>. The CDF conducts active training and awareness campaigns, including "pulp timing" and "Red timing" exercises, to test users' security levels and provoke them into making mistakes, which helps them learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

### Future Readiness
While the initial declaration for Poland's Cyber Army was readiness by the end of 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>, the CDF did not wait and has been actively building capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. Combat readiness in cybersecurity is an ongoing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>. Poland's performance in international exercises, such as Lock Shields, where they secured third place this year and second place last year, demonstrates the maturity and [[polands_potential_in_the_field_of_machine_learning_and_ai | potential of Poland]]'s cyberspace defense forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.
The CDF operates 24/7, acknowledging that attackers do not adhere to regular working hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>.

## Leadership

General of Division Karol Molenda was entrusted with building the Cyberspace Defense Forces in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. His experience in military counterintelligence, where he co-created cybersecurity and cyber counterintelligence departments from 2006, proved beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. The recent promotion of General Molenda and his deputy to general ranks on the same day is seen as a recognition of the CDF's effectiveness and functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. Poland continues to learn from the war in Ukraine to further enhance its cybersecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

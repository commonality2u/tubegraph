Sir Roger Penrose, a mathematical physicist, received the Stanisław Lem Prize in 2024 for his fundamental contributions to the development of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. He describes himself as more inclined towards physics than mathematics, with his heart lying with the part of twistor theory that relates to physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

## Nobel Prize for Proving Singularity
Roger Penrose was awarded the Nobel Prize for demonstrating the falsity of the statement that complex systems would not lead to [[Singularities and Gravitational Collapse | singularities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. He proved the existence of [[Singularities and Gravitational Collapse | singularities]] given a specific criterion of collapse, a place beyond the point of no return that he called a "trapped surface" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. His work aimed to show that [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] [[Singularities and Gravitational Collapse | singularities]] were not just artifacts of specific, unrealistic models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

### Challenging the Oppenheimer-Snyder Model
A famous article by Oppenheimer and Snyder, published around 1939, described a dust cloud that collapsed into a [[Singularities and Gravitational Collapse | singularity]] of infinite density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. However, this model was widely disbelieved at the time because it did not include pressure and assumed perfect spherical symmetry, leading to an unrealistic collapse to a single point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

Furthermore, observations of active phenomena in distant galaxies suggested bodies beyond the scope of the Oppenheimer-Snyder model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Two Russian physicists, Lvshica and Kalatnikov, published a paper attempting to prove that in complex, irregular systems, [[Singularities and Gravitational Collapse | singularities]] (infinite density) would not appear, and bodies would rotate and escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. This view significantly influenced the scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

Penrose's theorem was formulated in response to these arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. He analyzed the work of Lvshica and Kalatnikov and found an error, which was later corrected by Beliński, who confirmed that oddities ([[Singularities and Gravitational Collapse | singularities]]) were common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. Penrose independently demonstrated the necessity of an error in their claims using completely different, previously unused methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

## Penrose's Unique Approach
Instead of writing down and solving equations, Penrose developed techniques for looking at causal structure and analyzing the general characteristics of space-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. He focused on concepts like "trapped surfaces," which were not previously considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

A trapped surface is a two-dimensional surface that, if imagined as a flash of light, would have light rays on both its inside and outside converging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. This concept, along with the theorem that every point on the boundary of a space-time future must lie on a ray of light, allowed him to prove the existence of [[Singularities and Gravitational Collapse | singularities]] without assuming specific situations like the Oppenheimer-Snyder model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

## Collaboration with Stephen Hawking
Penrose frequently collaborated with Stephen Hawking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Penrose states that on the topic of [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] [[Singularities and Gravitational Collapse | singularities]], he was the main author, and the key ideas were his <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. He also credits Brandon Carter for correcting errors in Hawking's early work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. While Hawking developed certain techniques more than Penrose, the fundamental concepts originated with Penrose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. Hawking's most important independent contribution concerned the evaporation of [[Understanding black holes and their role in the universe | black holes]] (Hawking radiation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.

## Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC)
Penrose has developed a cosmological model, Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC), which proposes that the universe did not begin with a single Big Bang, nor will it end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. Instead, the Big Bang of our eon is the end of a previous eon, and our eon will transition into a future one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>.

Key elements of CCC include:
*   **Gravitational Wave Signals:** Collisions between [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]], particularly supermassive ones, produce gravitational wave signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>. These signals create "rings in the sky," which Penrose suggests may be confirmed by discoveries like Priscilla Lopez's galaxy circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>.
*   **Hawking Radiation:** Hawking discovered that [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] are not completely cold but have a temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[19:25:00]</a>. Larger [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] have lower temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. As the universe expands and cools, it will eventually become cooler than [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]], causing them to evaporate over an incredibly long time (estimated 10^100 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a>.
*   **Signals in Microwave Background Radiation:** The radiation from evaporating [[Understanding black holes and their role in the universe | black holes]] passes into the next eon, causing "single point explosions" that create signals in the sky, heating certain regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>. Penrose claims these spots in the sky are observed with a high confidence level of 99.98%, and conventional theory does not explain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>.

Penrose views these predictions as belonging to conformal cyclic cosmology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>. He speculates that CCC might eventually be combined with twistor theory, though currently they are separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:00">[21:22:00]</a>. His book, *Cycles of Time*, provides a description of the transition from one eon to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>.

## The Birth of Conformal Infinity and Twistor Theory
Penrose's interest in [[Black holes and Einsteins theory of relativity | relativity theory]] deepened through his work on gravitational waves with Herman Bondy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>. A key insight came from understanding Ray Sax's "flaking theorem" regarding the behavior of the radiation field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:38:00">[24:38:00]</a>. Penrose realized this was connected to conformality, leading to the birth of "conformal infinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:00">[25:08:00]</a>.

His understanding of conformal invariance of Maxwell's equations and the importance of separating positive and negative frequencies, explained by his office-mate Engelbert Schuking, led him to the development of Twistor theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:00">[25:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>.

> "I don't differentiate between fun and serious learning." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>

Penrose considers mathematical physics largely as "fun," driven by the desire to solve problems and the pleasure derived from exploring topics like causal spaces and the boundaries of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. He notes that the mathematical techniques he used for his Nobel Prize-winning theorem were developed for fun, not necessarily to prove that specific claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.

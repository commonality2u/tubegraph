## Introduction to Spacetime and Travel Concepts
For decades, the beginning of time has been believed to be the Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. There has also been much discussion about the possibility of achieving speeds greater than light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. In Poland, a synchronization protocol called "White Rabbit" was developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Theories on Spacetime Tunnels
While [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels|wormholes]] were considered strictly theoretical objects a few years ago, possibly existing but beyond human reach, today physicists are theoretically more willing to accept the possibility of traveling with the help of [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels|space-time tunnels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>.

### Einstein's Contributions
About 100 years ago, Einstein published two significant documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:42">[01:41:42]</a>:
*   One known as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.
*   The second describes [[quantum_entanglement_and_its_significance|quantum entanglement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:08">[02:04:08]</a>.

Today, physicists are in practical agreement that both documents describe the same phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>.

### Connection Between Entanglement and Spacetime Tunnels
A [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels|space-time tunnel]] formed by the merger of two black holes implies that these black holes must be completely [[quantum_entanglement_and_its_significance|entangled]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:35">[02:12:35]</a>.

### Understanding Entanglement
[[quantum_entanglement_and_its_significance|Entanglement]] is an inexplicable phenomenon that is assumed to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Two particles are [[quantum_entanglement_and_its_significance|entangled]] when they behave in a consistent way: if the quantum state of one particle changes, the second particle will also change its state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:35">[02:32:35]</a>. In laboratory conditions, particles must interact for [[quantum_entanglement_and_its_significance|entanglement]] to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:10">[02:45:10]</a>. [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels|Space-time tunnels]] are believed to be based on black holes that need to be [[quantum_entanglement_and_its_significance|entangled]] to establish this connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:27">[02:53:27]</a>.

### Stability of Spacetime Tunnels
Historically, [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels|space-time tunnels]] were considered unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:44">[03:08:44]</a>. It was thought that one could not jump into a black hole on one side and emerge from the other because there's a disruption of time inside, where time and space exchange placesâ€”an abstract and difficult concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:45">[03:32:45]</a>. Maintaining the stability of such a tunnel to exit on the other side is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:37">[03:42:37]</a>.

For many years, it was believed that individuals jumping into such a tunnel would be torn apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:13">[03:52:13]</a>. While there is debate in physics about whether anything can fall out of a black hole (Hawking believed not, but current scientists suggest it can in the form of light), physicists like Leonard Susskind agree that with the right amount of information introduced into [[quantum_entanglement_and_its_significance|entangled]] black holes, stability can be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:15">[04:17:15]</a>. However, exiting from the other side remains beyond current civilization's technical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:07">[04:57:07]</a>.

## Practical Applications and Research
The phenomenon of [[quantum_entanglement_and_its_significance|quantum entanglement]] is now used in quantum computers for error correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:51">[05:16:51]</a>. Experiments and theoretical models of quantum field theory and gravity are conducted on quantum computer platforms to ensure error correction and encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:27">[05:24:27]</a>. The biggest challenge in [[quantum_entanglement_and_its_significance|entanglement]] (understood as particle interaction) is ensuring error correction, which entanglement provides as an experimental testing ground before dreaming of [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels|space-time tunnel]] travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:10">[05:45:10]</a>.

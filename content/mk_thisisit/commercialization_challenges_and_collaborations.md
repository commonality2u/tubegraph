Newmo, a Polish company, has developed a levitating railway system known as Lewmo, which utilizes existing railway infrastructure to achieve high speeds and enhanced capabilities for trains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This technology, which uses passive levitation via permanent magnets and aluminum plates, allows trains to float a few centimeters above a specially added levitation beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The system is designed to be an overlay on current infrastructure, avoiding the need to rebuild entire rail networks, and incorporates a linear drive system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Newmo holds a patent for its unique integration method, making it a pioneer in this field globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The target speed for the system is up to 550 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

### Funding and Public Perception
The initial years of Newmo's existence were challenging, primarily due to difficulties in raising money and "selling dreams" in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. Polish deep-tech projects often face accusations of being scams or politically motivated, which creates a significant problem for acquiring funds for early-stage technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Despite these hurdles, Newmo secured strong partners and subsidies, culminating in a 16.5 million PLN project funded by NCBiR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

### Regulatory and Systemic Barriers
The railway sector is highly regulated, prioritizing safety and security, which leads to extensive bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. As an innovative technology, Newmo faces a "regulation wall" of paper, discussions, and lobbying to gain authorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. The authorization process for passenger transport systems can take 5 to 10 years, even for relatively simple changes like a new type of sleeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. For passenger transport, the company aims for pilots around 2028, with full passenger operation by 2030, a timeline largely dictated by these authorization processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

### Comparison to Other Technologies
Newmo's concept originated from Hyperloop ideas, which proposed vehicles moving in vacuum tubes at near-supersonic speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.The Newmo team, initially a small student group, competed in the Elon Musk Hyperloop competition, achieving a top 10 finish among hundreds of participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. They recognized Hyperloop's significant cost problems due to the need for entirely new infrastructure, similar to Maglev systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Maglevs also suffer from being isolated systems, making last-mile connectivity to city centers difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Newmo's strategy is to integrate their technology onto existing railway infrastructure, leveraging existing transport corridors and city center connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

The cost of implementing Newmo's technology for a route like Kraków-Gdańsk (approx. 700 km) is estimated at around 500 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. This is significantly cheaper than building a comparable Shinkansen line, which could cost between 50 and 150 million dollars per kilometer, potentially running into tens or even billions of euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.

Newmo's core team is Polish, but they have aimed to be a European company from the start, with personnel in Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. The response to their technology in Western Europe has been "much, much better" than in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. Newmo currently cooperates with the three largest infrastructure managers in Europe, but not yet with Poland's PKP PLK, despite it being the first railway company they contacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. They hope to refresh Polish contacts after recent demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

Newmo positions itself as the "Polish answer" or "European answer" to the Chinese railway revolution, possessing unique technology that China currently lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. This advantage lies in their ability to apply Maglev-derivative systems within Europe's existing, dense, and heavily regulated railway network, unlike China which often builds new lines "in a meadow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. The company aims to be a "European chance for the revitalization of transport" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Market Strategy
Newmo is also developing solutions for freight transport, including "Il Buster," a system for automatic, locomotive-free movement of freight wagons using only linear drive. This is not a levitating system, but it promises significant increases in throughput and profitability for freight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. The company aims for passenger transport to be operational by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

The broader future of Polish railways is seen as positive, driven by macro factors and European initiatives such as the Central Communication Port (CPK) and Rail Baltica, which will position Poland as a transport hub for Eastern and Southeastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. There is growing pressure at the European level for greener transport and increased capacity, which the railway sector is well-suited to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

However, the speaker emphasizes the need for "greater openness to innovation" in Europe to avoid losing to faster-paced East Asian competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. They appeal for a more supportive public reaction to innovations, urging people to consider the consequences of negative comments before dismissing new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>.

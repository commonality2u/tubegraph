[[Genetic modification and the future of humanity | Genetic engineering]] is anticipated to be a future development capable of expanding human memory and imagination, as well as biologically improving individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This technological advancement is considered a significant discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

The potential impact of [[genetic_modification_and_the_future_of_humanity | genetic engineering]] raises fundamental questions about what it means to be human. It is pondered whether a future "Trans man," enhanced by such technology, would still be classified as human or would evolve into "another, better species" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The notion of humanity as the "best creation of evolution" is challenged by the possibility that [[ethical_and_evolutionary_implications_of_human_genome_modification | human genome modification]] could lead to the creation of something even superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Black Holes and New Universes

Physicist Nikodem Popławski proposes that black holes may create new universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. His concept suggests that instead of a singularity, every black hole creates an [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | Einstein-Rosen bridge]], or a [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | spacetime wormhole]], leading to a new universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This idea was recognized by National Geographic and *Science* magazine as one of the most important scientific concepts of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Morgan Freeman even called Popławski the "second Copernicus" in his series *Curiosity*, and the scientific search engine *Zapro* recognized him as Einstein's successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

Popławski's theory posits that our universe was created on the other side of the event horizon of a black hole that formed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The only way out of our universe, according to this theory, is this black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### The Singularity Problem and the Big Bounce

In the standard general theory of relativity, when matter collapses to form a black hole, it is predicted to collapse to a point called a singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. At this singularity, the density of matter and the [[Geometry and spacetime | curvature of spacetime]] become infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This presents a major problem for general relativity, as infinite quantities cannot be physically measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, indicating the theory is incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Popławski's alternative suggests that matter does not collapse to a singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Instead, it collapses to a state of very high density, then stops and begins to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This matter cannot return to its origin beyond the black hole's event horizon because movement through it is one-way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Since [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | spacetime]] inside a black hole is not static, this matter is forced to expand into a new space, interpreted as a new expanding universe on the other side of the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This non-singular bounce is known as the "Big Bounce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

Even Stephen Hawking considered the possibility of black holes creating new universes, writing an essay on the topic in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## The Nature of [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | Spacetime]] and [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | Wormholes]]

### [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | Time]] as a Dimension

Popławski believes that [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | time]] exists and is not an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>. The Minkowski [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | spacetime]] model, which assumes [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | time]] is the fourth dimension, forms the basis of general relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. General relativity successfully explains phenomena like the bending of light by massive objects and Mercury's orbital precession, which were puzzles for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

Gravity curves not only space but also [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. For example, [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | time]] slows down near massive objects like the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. Near a black hole's event horizon, [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | time]] effectively freezes to zero for an external observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. This means that, according to earthly [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | time]], someone falling into a black hole would never actually cross the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. However, in the observer's own "proper time," the passage through the event horizon occurs in a finite [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | time]], and they would perceive themselves as being inside the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

There are hypotheses that [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | time]] might cease to exist on the other side of an event horizon, becoming a fourth spatial dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. Stephen Hawking was among the first physicists to propose that [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | time]] could cease to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>. Another model suggests that a radial spatial dimension switches roles with [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | time]] on the other side of the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.

### [[Classical spacetime and gravity | Classical Spacetime]] vs. Quantum Gravity

Popławski believes that [[Classical spacetime and gravity | spacetime]] is fundamentally classical, and there are no gravitons (carriers of gravity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. Instead, the [[Geometry and spacetime | curvature of spacetime]] itself is the fundamental aspect of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. While matter is quantized and interacts through quantum forces (electromagnetism, weak, and strong interactions), these interactions occur within a curved, classical [[Classical spacetime and gravity | spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. This perspective contrasts with theories of quantum gravity that attempt to quantize gravity through gravitons or view [[Classical spacetime and gravity | spacetime]] as fundamentally flat with quantum corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.

Roger Penrose proposed that gravity itself causes the collapse of the wave function in quantum mechanics, suggesting that stronger gravity leads to faster collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.

### The Role of Spacetime Torsion

Popławski's work, which he has studied for 15 years, incorporates the concept of spacetime torsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. This concept originates from the Einstein-Cartan theory, created by Élie Cartan in 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. Torsion is an additional quantity of [[Geometry and spacetime | spacetime]] beyond curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. It is typically assumed to be zero in general relativity, leading to singularities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.

However, if torsion is not forced to be zero, it acts as a repulsive gravitational force at very high densities (like those near a singularity or the Big Bang) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. This repulsive gravity prevents the formation of singularities, allowing matter to "bounce" instead of collapsing infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>. This "Big Bounce" means that instead of a singularity, the matter stops and expands, creating a new universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.

The combination of [[Geometry and spacetime | spacetime]] torsion and the quantum production of particle-antiparticle pairs at high densities naturally leads to a period of exponential expansion, known as inflation, immediately after the Big Bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>. This model provides an explanation for inflation without relying on hypothetical scalar fields, and it naturally predicts that inflation is short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>.

## Multiverses and Cosmological Selection

If every black hole creates a new universe, this would imply a multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. However, Popławski's multiverse differs from the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, where an electron exists in multiple places simultaneously, creating many copies of ourselves in different universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. In Popławski's model, one can only exist in one universe at a time, and to travel to another, one would need to enter a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

Lee Smolin also proposed that each black hole creates a new universe in the 1970s or 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Smolin's idea was that the final singularity of a black hole becomes the initial singularity (Big Bang) of a new universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. Because singularities cause the laws of physics to break down, new universes could have different laws and constants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Smolin further suggested "cosmological selection," where universes with laws of physics that enable the creation of more black holes (and thus more universes) would continue their cycle, while others would end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

In Popławski's model, because there are no singularities due to spacetime torsion, the laws of physics do not reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. Therefore, the new universe inside a black hole would have the same laws of physics and constants as the parent universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

## Observational Confirmation

Popławski's theory suggests that our universe is "on the other side" of the event horizon of a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The expansion dynamics of the universe just after the "Big Bounce" resemble inflation, and this specific curve can be studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

One potential confirmation could come from observing the merger of black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. If two black holes merge, and each created a new universe, these two universes would suddenly merge into one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. From an observer's perspective, our universe, which is generally spherically symmetrical, would suddenly exhibit an asymmetry or a distinguished direction where the second universe merged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. Some astronomers have observed slight asymmetries in the movement of galaxy superclusters, suggesting a distinguished direction, though this data is debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. If such a distinguished direction were confirmed, it would strongly support the idea of our universe merging with another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

Another form of evidence would be the discovery of a white hole in our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. According to Popławski, the black hole that created our universe would appear as a white hole from our perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. A white hole is the other side of a [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | spacetime wormhole]] where matter cannot enter but everything comes out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. The discovery of a single white hole would confirm this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

The cosmic microwave background radiation, specifically tiny temperature differences, could also potentially confirm or disprove the specific dynamics of the universe's expansion after the Big Bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.

## Traveling Through [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | Wormholes]]

While traveling between these universes would be fascinating, it would unfortunately be a one-way trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. Once one enters a black hole, there's no going back across the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

Entering large black holes, such as the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* at the center of our galaxy, is surprisingly safe due to minimal tidal forces at the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. Smaller black holes, however, are dangerous, as their strong tidal forces would stretch a person apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

Upon entering a black hole, one would still be able to see the rest of the universe, albeit greatly deformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. The new universe formed inside a black hole could be large and cool enough to be hospitable, or it could be very fresh and hot, making survival impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. It is also possible that by falling into the black hole, the observer participates in the creation of the new universe itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.

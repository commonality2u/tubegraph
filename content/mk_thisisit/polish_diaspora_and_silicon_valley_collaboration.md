Professor Piotr Moncarz, a Polish engineer from Stanford University, is a key figure in fostering collaboration between the Polish diaspora and Silicon Valley. He supports Poland by co-creating the first Polish-American Hub, known as Poland.Sil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## The Challenge: Poland's Absence in Global Technology Hubs

A statement from the Polish Academy of Sciences on Twitter noted that "[[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Polish science is drowning]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Professor Moncarz suggests there is a danger in this assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. He highlights that when [[export_of_polish_scientific_talent_and_its_consequences | Polish talent]] helps build something new abroad, Poland loses the opportunity to build it domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. While science is global, it doesn't mean that Polish universities should "polish diamonds here so that they can leave and serve someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Currently, [[polands_representation_in_global_technology_hubs | Poland has "zero zero" representation]] in international science and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Individual Polish scientists and technologists exist and are successful globally, but "[[polands_representation_in_global_technology_hubs | Poland as such does not exist]]" on the international stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This lack of collective presence means Poland is not a significant element in the economic structures of the world's innovation centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Many European Union countries have dozens of centers in Silicon Valley representing their science, business, and investments; Poland, however, has "zero zeros" in each category compared to nations like France, Germany, and Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### Consequences of Talent Migration
Polish talent, educated within Poland's infrastructure, participates at the highest level in global artificial intelligence development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, but Poland receives disproportionately little benefit from this investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The challenge is to create structures where these talents can achieve success in Poland and showcase it to the world as Polish innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This also applies to Poles working in the Polish branches of global companies like Google, Intel, Volkswagen, and Siemens, whose contributions are often branded under the foreign company's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The danger of [[export_of_polish_scientific_talent_and_its_consequences | Polish science drowning]] lies in the difficulty of convincing outstanding academic staff to remain at Polish universities to conduct research and educate future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Low wages at universities and insufficient cooperation with the external market lead to a [[talent_migration_from_poland_to_international_markets | talent drain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. For instance, a Stanford AI doctorate graduate can earn up to a million dollars a year as a first salary, making it hard for Polish institutions to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## The Solution: The Polish-American Hub
The [[the_relationship_between_poland_and_the_united_states_in_technology | Poland.Sil institution]] was created to establish a "Polish-American Hub" focused on showcasing Poland's highest intellect and entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This initiative was driven by local Polonia (Polish diaspora) in Silicon Valley with strong community support, including professors and vice-presidents of large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The Hub's greatest success is its very creation and the realization that the community *can* establish such an enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. It operates like a business, providing products and results to Polish clients (universities, cities, companies) who invest funds into the Hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. This contract-based approach is strong in the "Polish-American genes" of the initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

Professor Moncarz views the Polish-American Hub as Poland's formal public representation in Silicon Valley, similar to how German or Swiss hubs are run by their respective diasporas and supported by their governments or organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. These dynamic organizations not only participate in but also help shape Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

## Polish Talent and Innovation
Poland has the potential to be a leader in AI and broader technology, as evidenced by the participation of Poles in global AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Polish talent, with the right opportunities and support, can achieve great success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

The problem of Polish science is fragmented structure rather than a lack of individual talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Polish universities, while independent, need to work together as a common body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Unlike American universities, which operate within an economic structure highly receptive to their output, Poland lacks the "suction pumps that pull out the best ideas based on university science and economic product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

There is a growing social interest in science in Poland, highlighted by the public's response to the situation involving Professor Piotr Sankowski and the AI institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This public resistance influenced authorities to maintain the institute and establish a new one dedicated to AI, suggesting a positive shift in the perception of scientists' social position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

### Distinctive Polish Traits
Poland has strong [[polish_culture_and_technological_innovation | social features]] that distinguish it in science:
*   **Mathematics**: Poland consistently ranks among leading countries in international subject olympiads for young people and has a long tradition of excellent preparation in mathematics, chemistry, and computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. This reflects not only a "gene" for mathematics but also a solid teaching tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   **Creativity**: Polish creativity, potentially stemming from historical necessity for survival and breaking through systems, is a significant asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. The saying "a Pole can" is rooted in the historical ability to survive and succeed in difficult conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Many educated Poles who left Poland, starting with nothing, have become successful entrepreneurs and leaders in the global elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

However, Poland needs to improve conditions for talented individuals to break through *within* Poland and from there into the world, rather than forcing them to leave to achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

## Fostering Cooperation and Interdependence
Professor Moncarz sees his frequent visits to Poland as "oxygen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. He emphasizes the need for teamwork for the common good in Poland, something strongly developed in the United States, where pioneers learned that individual survival depended on cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. The strength of America lies in its "citizenship" and its ability to work together, understanding interdependence not as a burden but as a strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

Moncarz hopes that Poland will better understand this positive interdependence, extending beyond mere patriotism to daily work and company integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

In [[the_relationship_between_poland_and_the_united_states_in_technology | transatlantic relations]], he advocates for thinking of the US and EU as a single cultural-economic element that, through cooperation, can shape the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. He believes America cannot play its past role without stronger cooperation with Europe, and Europe, having "slept through a huge period of technological development," needs to catch up with world leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

Moncarz is skeptical of the European Union's excessive bureaucracy, which he sees as hindering innovation and development, contrasting it with the US model of constant change and openness to new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. He maintains that while the US is not ideal, its strength lies in continuously seeking improvements in the quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.

Despite his career in the United States, Professor Moncarz considers himself "more Polish" due to a deeper, innate connection to Poland, viewing America as a place he learned to like, respect, and be grateful for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. His journey to the US was spurred by an advisor's suggestion and a series of "happy coincidences" he chose to act upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

While approximately 95% of UFO observations are considered suitable for rejection, about 5% are described as "hair-raising," made by multiple witnesses using different technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, the search for intelligent life in the universe does not rely on observing flying saucers, as tangible proof of alien technology or aliens themselves has not been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. There is no repeatable, multiple evidence using various methods to confirm contact with a technologically advanced civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## The Possibility of Faster-Than-Light Travel

Currently, it is not believed that [[possibility_of_faster_than_light_speed | faster than light]] ships are possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. However, [[physics_of_fasterthanlight_travel | Warp drive]] technology may be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Two main types of [[physics_of_fasterthanlight_travel | Warp drives]] are distinguished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Types of Warp Drives

1.  **Alcubierre Drive**: This method involves bending [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Miguel Alcubierre discovered a solution to Einstein's equations that theoretically allows for movement [[physics_of_fasterthanlight_travel | faster than light]] by distorting [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This is consistent with Einstein's theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
2.  **[[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | Wormholes]]**: This method involves creating a shortcut by cutting a "hole" in [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This is known as a [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | wormhole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### The Challenge of Planck Energy

The primary obstacle to building a [[physics_of_fasterthanlight_travel | Warp drive]] or cutting a hole in [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | spacetime]] is the immense energy required, known as Planck energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Our current particle accelerators can reach a maximum of trillions of electron volts, but Planck energy is approximately 10^19 billion electron volts, or one with 19 zeros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. We are still far from being able to harness this level of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Civilizations and Advanced Technologies

Planck energy characterizes a Type III civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Such a civilization would have the energy to bend [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | spacetime]] and potentially even build a [[Time_travel_and_the_nature_of_time | time machine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Humanity is currently considered a Type 0 civilization on the scale of civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Types of Civilizations

Physicists categorize civilizations based on their energy mastery:
*   **Type I Civilization**: Controls all the energy of its home planet, managing natural phenomena like earthquakes and volcanoes, and utilizing all sunlight reaching the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. These civilizations could colonize several planets in their solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   **Type II Civilization**: Utilizes the power of its home planet and its sun, harnessing all the sun's energy to power its machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The Federation of Planets in *Star Trek* is an example of a Type II civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Even Type II civilizations would struggle to approach the speed of light needed for interstellar travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Type III Civilization**: Possesses a galactic character, capable of traversing galactic routes and manipulating phenomena like [[black_holes_wormholes_and_the_information_paradox | black holes]], as depicted in *Star Wars* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. A Type III civilization would likely have access to Planck energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

### Planck Energy and Spacetime Stability

Planck energy is the highest energy in the universe, at which the universe itself loses stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Exceeding this energy level can cause [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | spacetime]] anomalies, described as "[[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | spacetime]] foam" by Stephen Hawking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This foam consists of bubbles that form and disappear when [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | spacetime]] becomes unstable at unimaginably high temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. The Big Bang itself could have been a bubble that reached Planck energy and then began to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This environment could potentially be used by a Type III civilization as a gateway for [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | space travel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

## Alien Visits

For an alien civilization to reach Earth, it would likely need to be a Type III civilization, which would be about 100,000 years more advanced than Earth, developing exponentially and having reached Planck energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The question remains whether such civilizations visit us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Given humanity's current level, we might be considered uninteresting or a mere curiosity to an advanced civilization, as we may have little to offer them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

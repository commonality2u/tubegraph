Professor Andrzej Targowski, a pioneer of Polish computer science, is recognized for his significant contributions, including the creation of the PESEL system and conceptualizing the information highway well before the internet's widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>. His work is characterized by a human-centric approach to technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

## PESEL System Development

The PESEL system, a national information system, originated from a concept proposed by Professor Targowski <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The idea was partly inspired by the American Social Security number, which serves as a main identification number in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:36">[09:16:36]</a>. The need for such a system in Poland became apparent in the context of economic crisis alleviation efforts in 1935, when a number was required to count and distinguish people for social benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:55">[09:33:55]</a>.

Professor Targowski, initially delegated to the PESEL project while serving as deputy head of the National IT Office, is considered the "father of the Polish PESEL system" because he introduced it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:43">[10:29:43]</a>. He developed an IT Development Program using a "social method" with a group of colleagues, including Stefan Bratkowski, forming the Polish Committee for Automatic Information Processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:36">[11:00:36]</a>. He first proposed the PESEL system to the Minister of Internal Affairs, Mr. Nobleman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:26">[11:30:26]</a>.

The conceptual framework and regularity of the PESEL area, part of the national IT system he devised, have survived to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>. However, the broader national IT system, conceived by Professor Targowski, faced significant opposition and was not fully implemented in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:21">[16:06:21]</a>. Despite his system being approved over rival proposals in April 1970, it was not adopted for implementation by Stanis≈Çaw Kielan, the Government Plenipotentiary for Electronic Computing Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>.

The vision for this national IT system was to serve as a basis for information exchange between national systems and to function as a public internet for administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:18">[19:02:18]</a>. The implementation gained momentum when Gierek came to power, with Mr. Nobleman, who supported Gierek, backing computer science initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:04">[19:19:04]</a>.

### Pre-Internet Information Highway

Professor Targowski developed a project for a fast "information highway" in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, 11 years before the internet was popularized in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. He clarifies that the concept of the internet's creator is often misattributed, noting that Vinton Cer, often cited, is actually the creator of database concepts, not the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>.

## Pioneering Digital Cities in the United States

During a sabbatical, Professor Targowski implemented one of the first digital cities in U.S. history, the "Tele City of Kalamazoo" project, located near Chicago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This initiative, undertaken at Kalamazoo City Hall, involved setting up a computing center with his students and attempting to implement a comprehensive information system akin to what he had failed to achieve in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>. The project received substantial government funding, approximately 3 million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:00">[24:19:00]</a>. He taught courses on website creation and saw graduates establish successful private networks, one even becoming a millionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>. Simultaneously, Chicago Online was being developed, which later evolved into America Online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:45:00">[25:45:00]</a>.

## Strategic Informatics and Innovation Challenges in Poland

Strategic informatics, as defined by Professor Targowski, involves stable infrastructure, databases, and data transmission networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:00">[26:12:00]</a>. While Poland has made some progress in digital services, such as ID cards and driving licenses on mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>, Professor Targowski notes significant challenges in [[technological_innovations_in_poland | technological innovations in Poland]].

According to Eurostat results on digital awareness, Poland ranks near the bottom in Europe, only above Romania and Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>. The number of new patent applications is remarkably low: Warsaw sees around 177 per year, Krakow 144, compared to 9,000 in Munich and 25,000-60,000 in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>.

Professor Targowski attributes this "hopeless" situation to the "tragic way of higher education" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>. He criticizes the current system, stating that while Poland trains very good programmers, including those winning international competitions from the University of Warsaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>, there is a severe lack of system designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>. He contrasts the extensive credit hours required for system designers in American education (120 credit hours) with the much lower requirement in Poland (24 credit hours at Warsaw University of Technology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>. This reflects the [[pathologies_of_the_polish_scientific_assessment_system | pathologies of the Polish scientific assessment system]] and its impact on [[education_and_global_impact_of_polish_programmers | education and global impact of Polish programmers]].

He emphasizes the need for a shift from "vertical" (highly specialized) thinking to "horizontal" (broad, interdisciplinary) knowledge. He argues that innovation, particularly in the digital environment, often comes from individuals with a wide spectrum of knowledge, not just deep specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:53:00">[35:53:00]</a>. He cites the example of Polish pilots in World War II, who, unlike their British counterparts, thought "horizontally," maintaining a 360-degree view that prevented them from being surprised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:49:00">[34:49:00]</a>.

Professor Targowski also warns about the future of programmers, stating it is a "dying profession" due to artificial intelligence and outsourcing to countries like India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>.

## Computer Science and Humanity

A core tenet of Professor Targowski's philosophy is that "computer science cannot attack customs; computer science must support a person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. He expresses concern that modern technology, particularly applications developed by businesses, increasingly "eliminates human work" and "attacks and eliminates" people, often without shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:00:00">[28:00:00]</a>.

## Life Philosophy

Professor Targowski believes that knowledge is not wisdom; rather, the ability to apply knowledge is wisdom, emphasizing the power of reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. His approach to understanding complex systems, including the universe, is graphical rather than purely mathematical, as he finds mathematics can over-detail and make concepts incomprehensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:00]</a>.

He engages in constant intellectual struggle, driven by fundamental questions such as Fermi's paradox about the existence of God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:00">[42:02:00]</a>. He proposes that God might not be a cloud but a living being or an advanced society that has developed science over millions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:00]</a>.

He also critically assesses Poland's political system, calling it a "non-innovative political system" or a "pseudo democracy" that yields bad results, contrasting it with Western democracies despite Polish leaders traveling globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11:00">[43:11:00]</a>.

## Traumatic Experiences

Professor Targowski has survived two significant attacks. The first occurred during the Warsaw Uprising, where he was saved by his nanny who was killed protecting him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. The second was on November 22, 1988, carried out by the Polish People's Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. He was seriously injured with a concussion and seven broken ribs after being run over by a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. This attack was politically motivated due to his extensive writings in the Polish press and participation in broadcasts for Radio Free Europe and Voice of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. These traumatic events are believed to have deeply influenced his empathetic and human-centered approach to technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

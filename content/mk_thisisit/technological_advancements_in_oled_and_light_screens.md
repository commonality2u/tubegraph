A groundbreaking factory, the first of its kind in the world, has opened in Berlin, Germany, focusing on the printing of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This facility is dedicated to the "science fiction technology" of printing light screens that are as thin as a sheet of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Innovation in Printed Light Technology

The core innovation involves printing light in three primary colors: red, green, and blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. These are referred to as [[oled_printing_technology | OLEDs]], which are flexible luminous elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. The ultimate goal is to print screens capable of displaying Ultra HD quality images and moving films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. Initial tests for printing such screens with pixel matrices were successful in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.

### Production Process

The most groundbreaking aspect of this [[oled_printing_technology | technology]] is its production process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. Traditionally, OLEDs are produced through complex pad welding processes involving vacuum heating and material evaporation, which are costly and limit shape flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Producing the same amount of OLEDs using traditional methods would require ten times the investment, roughly 100 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

This new process, however, exclusively uses printers normally used for color printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Materials are directly applied to plastic foils using these printers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. This method makes the production cheaper and allows the creation of OLED elements in "any shape," which is virtually impossible with older processes due to the expense of custom masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. This digital printing approach represents a significant leap forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. Currently, this company is the only one utilizing this specific [[oled_printing_technology | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

### Factory and Efficiency

The first pilot line was built in Berlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The new factory near Berlin, opened on March 11, cost approximately 10 million euros, considered "crazy cheap" relative to its capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. The majority of the cost came from the workforce and the engineering team that built the entire machine and process, not just purchased components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

The factory operates in a "Clean Room" with cleanliness standards comparable to semiconductor production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. It features full automation, with robots moving substrates between machines and under printers, eliminating human presence in certain production zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.

The current efficiency allows for printing about 8,000 square meters of OLEDs per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. The immediate focus is to scale this production and prove regular, repeatable manufacturing of these luminous elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

## [[applications_of_printed_screens | Applications of Printed Screens]]

The potential [[applications_of_printed_screens | applications of printed screens]] are vast:
*   **Thin, energy-efficient displays**: The technology can transform anything around us where light is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.
*   **Smart Packaging**: Screens on plastic packaging or other products could display information like expiration dates for food or medicine, or usage instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. This could enable "reusable packaging" and promote a "circular society" by reducing waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.
*   **Clothing**: Printed light elements can be integrated into clothing to increase visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
*   **Luxury Products**: Currently, the technology is being applied to luxury products to finance further progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   **Board Games**: The company indirectly partnered with Buffel Games to release an interactive, illuminated board game through Walmart, selling about 100,000 pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

The company's vision extends to enabling further [[future_technological_advancements_and_human_evolution | technological advancements]], such as printing screens for lenses, potentially leading to completely new applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

## Societal Impact and Future Outlook

The founders believe that this [[technological_advancements_and_societal_impact | technology]] can "change the face of the world" not just aesthetically, but by helping humanity become more efficient and live in harmony with nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

The company's valuation is estimated between 100 to 150 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. Despite the potential for significant financial gain, the founders are driven by a larger vision, prioritizing the company's long-term goals over an immediate sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. They view money as a "side effect" rather than the ultimate goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

The speaker notes that fear of [[technological_advancements_and_societal_impact | technology]] has historically been unjustified, citing examples like early 20th-century automation improving the quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. He maintains that humanity has always managed technological fluctuations and will ultimately use technology for good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

## [[technological_innovations_in_poland | Technological Innovations in Poland]]

While the primary factory is in Germany, the company has started investing in [[technological_innovations_in_poland | Poland]], with a sales office and plans to develop R&D and production departments directly for customers in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. The speaker sees Poles as inherently more inclined to take risks and achieve what is considered impossible, attributing this partly to Poland's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. He believes that Polish politics has created a good environment for funding companies with "crazy ideas" through VC funds and other vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. The company aims to produce regionally to quickly deliver to markets, including the USA and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.

Recent advancements in [[genetic modification and the future of humanity | genetic modification]] and DNA manipulation are paving the way for a future dominated by personalized medicine and highly targeted therapies. For the first time, countries like Great Britain and the United States have given approval to implement therapeutic methods based on [[Genome editing for therapeutic purposes | genome editing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, marking a significant breakthrough in medical science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## The Essence of DNA

DNA is considered the essence of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. It defines each individual person and strongly dictates our individuality, appearance, certain forms of behavior, and predispositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. While human intelligence doesn't have a direct DNA translation, certain genes encode proteins responsible for brain and nervous system efficiency, indirectly linking intelligence to our DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

DNA is a molecule found in nearly every cell, constantly exposed to external and internal factors that can cause it to break or become damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Cells possess a robust set of tools to prevent and rapidly repair such damage, including single- and double-strand breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The stability of DNA strands is also affected by age, as the effectiveness of repair mechanisms decreases over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Advancements in DNA Modification and Genome Editing

Current capabilities allow for the modification of DNA sequences by introducing fragments, deactivating genes, amplifying records, and even intentionally damaging DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. However, intervening in the human genome on a large scale presents significant challenges, including ethical concerns and safety issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The evolutionary consequences of such widespread interference are difficult to assess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Despite these challenges, a major breakthrough has occurred with the allowance of [[Genome editing for therapeutic purposes | therapeutic methods based on genome editing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. These methods, primarily focused on treating sickle cell anemia, are based on the intentional induction of specific types of DNA damage in precise locations within the sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Understanding how DNA repair machinery works allows for the proper design of these "machines" to cause damage effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The CRISPR technology, foundational to many of these advancements, has been widely appreciated as an absolute breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

## Targeted Therapies, Especially for Cancer

[[Modification of DNA to treat cancer and other diseases | Oncological diseases are already being treated by modifying DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The focus is on targeted therapies, designed to precisely damage DNA in cancer cells while sparing healthy cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This approach minimizes the severe side effects associated with traditional chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

Two types of targeted therapies are:
*   **DDR (Damage Response) Therapeutics**: These drugs inhibit the repair of DNA damage in cancer cells, causing their DNA to break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Examples include PARP inhibitors like Olaparib (Olar), Niraparib (Nar), and Rucaparib, which have been on the market for years and are used for ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers, showing very good effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
*   **Radiopharmaceuticals**: These molecules are precisely introduced into a patient's body, attaching specifically to tumor cells and emitting radiation (e.g., Alpha or Beta therapy). This radiation primarily causes DNA breaks in cancer cells, leading to their destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

## intoDNA: Pioneering DNA Damage Detection

Dr. Magdalena Kordon, a co-founder of the startup 'intoDNA' and a researcher at the Jagiellonian University, focuses on the detection of DNA damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Her doctoral research specifically explored single-strand DNA breaks and how the XRCC1 protein is delivered to repair these breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

intoDNA develops the "STRAIGHT technological platform," which originated at the Jagiellonian University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This platform was created because existing technologies couldn't directly prove the presence of low-level DNA cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. STRAIGHT is a highly sensitive and specific technology that marks and visualizes free ends of DNA or other damage, allowing researchers to count, localize, and understand them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

While intoDNA does not develop therapies itself, it assists companies and laboratories worldwide in developing new-generation targeted therapies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Their technology helps assess if a patient will respond to a specific drug by precisely defining and counting mechanical DNA damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. This precision is crucial for accelerating the drug development process and making effective decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

The startup's main interest lies in areas where DNA damage or stability is crucial, including:
*   Oncological diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>
*   Neurodegenerative diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>
*   Huntington's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>

## The Future of Medicine and Human Evolution

The future of [[Future technological advancements and human evolution | human evolution]] is intertwined with [[genetic modification and the future of humanity | genetic modification]]. Predictions suggest that the next generation may be permanently [[genetic modification and the future of humanity | genetically modified]] to such an extent that they might no longer be called *Homo sapiens* in the traditional sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. While the extent of future species change is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, the ability to edit human DNA holds immense potential.

Regarding cancer, a single cure is unlikely due to the unique nature of each tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The most effective direction for oncological therapies is personalized medicine, which involves:
*   Accurate diagnostics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>
*   Detailed characterization of specific tumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>
*   Both genetic and functional testing of the tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>

This comprehensive approach allows for tailoring therapy to the needs of each individual patient, making cancer a non-fatal disease in many cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. [[Genome editing for therapeutic purposes | Therapies based on genome editing]] could be one of these personalized solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

There is also a strong belief that through DNA modifications and continuous improvements in life quality and disease treatment, humans may eventually exceed the age of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. The average human survival rate has been consistently increasing historically, supporting this optimistic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

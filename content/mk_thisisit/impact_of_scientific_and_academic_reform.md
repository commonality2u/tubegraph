## Introduction to the Reform
A significant organizational reform was carried out at the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Polish Academy of Sciences, where the speaker previously served as director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. This reform aimed to address inherent issues within the existing scientific system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

## Background: The Old System's Flaws
The previous system of science in Poland was inherited from the Germans, but lacked the corresponding financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. In this older model, a professor heading a university department held immense authority, akin to "God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. This structure was characterized by authoritarian, noble power hierarchy, and was very ossified and hierarchical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. This system persisted throughout the 20th century in [[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Poland]] and continued to function to some extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.

A key reason for the need for reform was the exodus of many scientists from Europe, including [[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Poland]], to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. This was because American universities offered young scientists freedom; they were given a group and told to "do whatever you want" as long as they collected grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>. This highlights that scientists work more effectively when they feel freedom and when there is no hierarchical structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. In such environments, a scientist's position is determined by achievement, not by rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.

## Nature of the Reform
The reform implemented in the Institute mirrored this philosophy, emphasizing achievement over position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>. It introduced a "flat structure" where traditional departments led by a single head were replaced by independent research groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. These groups are primarily accountable to the director, who himself leads one of the research groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>. This structure aims to foster freedom for scientists, which was perceived as lacking for [[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Polish scientists]] previously, contributing to their emigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>.

## Positive Outcomes of the Reform
In retrospect, the reform proved highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. The Institute achieved a top "category A plus" rating twice in a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

Key indicators of success include:
*   **Increased Grant Funding** The amount of money secured from [[scientific_progress_and_funding_in_Poland | grants]] increased tenfold over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.
*   **Improved Publication Quality and Authorship** The quality of publications significantly improved, with a majority appearing in very good journals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>. Previously, leading authors on these works were often from abroad; now, the leaders of the Institute's own research groups are the primary authors, and the volume of such works has increased by an order of magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.
*   **Internationalization** A decade or so prior to the reform, only Polish was heard at the Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. Now, languages from all over the world can be heard, indicating a significant increase in international collaboration and presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

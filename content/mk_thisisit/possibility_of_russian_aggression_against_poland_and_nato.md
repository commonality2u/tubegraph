The head of the National Security Bureau (BBN) states that the prospect of war is real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. A potential [[potential_threat_of_world_war_iii_and_its_implications | World War III]] would cause the world as we know it to fall to ruins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. To avoid war, preparation for confrontation is needed within a three-year horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Europe wants to avoid war, and has all the resources to prevent it or end it before it breaks out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.

## Russian Military Intentions and Capabilities

Assessments of the Russian threat should be based on their recent actions, the resources at their disposal, how they manage those resources, and historical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Military Reform**: Russia's Minister of Defense, Shoigu, announced a plan to reform the Armed Forces by 2026, which includes establishing two armies and 14 brigades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Vladimir Putin's decree recorded the Russian Armed Forces at 1.3 million troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. An army of this strategic size is a tactical union that a defensive alliance like NATO cannot perceive only through a prism of defensive use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Financial Preparation**: Russia is creating resources and structures for offensive operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. Before the aggression in Ukraine, Russia had almost $600 billion in reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. While $300 billion of these were frozen, Russia has since increased its reserves and is buying gold on international markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Investing in gold makes sense if one expects a growing crisis, as the value of gold increases, providing greater resources for future aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## NATO's Role and Article 5

An attack on any country on NATO's eastern flank, particularly the Baltic countries, would have a critical impact on [[Polands Position in Cyberspace Defense | Poland's security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This is because an attack on any of these countries is considered an attack on the entire eastern flank, including Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Therefore, the North Atlantic Alliance must remain united <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

The credibility of Article 5, NATO's collective defense clause, depends heavily on the attitude of countries like Poland towards the Baltic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. If NATO members expect solidarity in defense, they must also treat their commitment to other members with "iron weight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

Public debate and skepticism regarding Article 5 are seen as normal in a democracy and cannot be prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. However, analysts who have not participated in real planning processes or seen regional defense plans do not have access to the detailed information available to military committees, commanders, or heads of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. The experience of a missile falling on Polish territory, killing citizens, immediately eliminates doubts about allied reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.

Article 5 is a living article, constantly debated and discussed over 75 years to define its meaning in terms of allied military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:12">[01:15:12]</a>. There is a growing awareness in the West that defending the eastern flank (e.g., Romania, Poland, Finland) is not just about individual countries, but about defending "our civilization, our way of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. A major war in Europe would change the lifestyle of inhabitants across the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>.

### Polish-American Relations

The visit of the Polish Prime Minister and President to the White House demonstrated the continuity of policy towards the most important ally across the Atlantic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>. From the American side, it also aimed to show the stability of these relations regardless of who holds the presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>. The strong relationship between the US National Security Council and the National Security Bureau in Warsaw is natural given that security is a leading topic in [[the_relationship_between_poland_and_the_united_states_in_technology | Polish-American relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>.

While a Trump victory is a real risk for Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>, it could have a "mobilizing effect," encouraging more European countries to take responsibility for security and strengthen their armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. This could be a radical but effective tool to increase European security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>.

The presence of the United States in the Pacific is a natural aspiration due to existing rivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. However, Europe remains the US's largest trading partner and export market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. Protecting this market is crucial for the American economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>.

## Poland's Defense Preparedness

[[Role and Development of Polish Cyber Army | Poland is creating the largest European land army]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, and if current arms purchases are delivered, it will become the absolutely largest land army in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.

Europe has significant shortages in ammunition production capacity, and development is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:05">[01:19:05]</a>. The European Commission's allocation of 500 million euros for investment in the arms industry is "ridiculously small" and "scandalously small" at such a critical moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>. In comparison, the previous Polish government allocated 2 billion zlotys (an amount comparable to 500 million euros) for its National Ammunition Reserve program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>. The low level of ambition of Polish defense company heads in preparing applications for funding is also a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:05">[01:20:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:35">[01:20:35]</a>.

There is potential in Poland for the production of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and advanced, guided, and gliding ammunition, as well as artillery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:12">[01:24:12]</a>. Poland should also aim to participate in the supply chain of global civilian unmanned flying vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>.

### National Security Strategy

The current National Security Strategy is being prepared to address the challenges faced by Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:07">[01:54:07]</a>. It is a high-level document covering areas such as energy security, demographic security, and [[Polands Position in Cyberspace Defense | cyber security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:06">[01:54:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:38">[01:54:38]</a>. The strategic aspect of state functioning has been underestimated in recent decades, despite Poland's success in transformation after 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:15">[01:55:15]</a>.

A "3 to 1" ratio is a basic military principle, stating that an aggressor needs three times the force to succeed against a defending opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:01">[01:51:01]</a>. To change this ratio in Poland's favor, given Russia's larger population, strategies include increasing the survivability of Polish soldiers, enhancing their ability to strike the enemy (e.g., using unmanned platforms), building defense capabilities through fortification, and improving situational awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:48">[01:52:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:08">[01:53:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:15">[01:53:15]</a>.

## Human Capital and Compulsory Service

A public debate about compulsory military service in Poland should be broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:50">[03:04:50]</a>. It should include access to military service, or at least mandatory civic or public service for every citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>. This is to instil the understanding that being a citizen involves duties beyond consumerism and the labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:34">[03:11:34]</a>.

The historical perception of military service in Poland, associated with Soviet-era armies, human rights violations, and violent customs, makes this debate difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:42">[03:40:42]</a>. However, today's army offers opportunities for scientific, professional, and personal ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:17">[03:41:17]</a>. Serving in the army does not only mean direct combat; it includes logistics, planning, advanced weapons service, computerization, cyber combat, and cognitive areas, many of which are far from the front line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:33">[03:43:33]</a>.

There is a place for people with diverse sexual preferences in the army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:21">[03:26:21]</a>. Decisions on military service are not based on sexual preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:01">[03:31:01]</a>. During wartime, services have more important tasks than tracking down individual citizens who attempt to flee the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:31">[03:37:31]</a>.

[[challenges_and_potential_in_polish_science_and_technology | Poland possesses incredible human capital and potential]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:01">[01:50:01]</a>. This is partly due to a relatively homogeneous social fabric and a better quality of education compared to some Western partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:41">[01:50:41]</a>. Foreign corporations invest in Poland's technology parks because of this human capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:34">[01:51:34]</a>. The launch of the NATO DIANA accelerator program in Poland is an answer to gaining access to knowledge, technology, and leveraging this human capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:49">[01:48:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:52">[01:49:52]</a>.

## Future Challenges and Strategies

Europe's perception of the threat is still too slow, although Macron's recent statements have initiated a necessary discussion about strategic ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:53">[01:41:53]</a>. However, there is still much to be done regarding European involvement in defending the continent as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:56">[01:42:56]</a>. The fact that 80% of defense spending in NATO comes from non-EU countries speaks for itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>. The proposal of 3% of GDP spending on defense, already declared by Lithuania for next year, will become a reality within the next three years to avoid war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:18">[01:43:18]</a>.

Europe's economy and capital base cover the capabilities of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:24">[01:44:24]</a>. However, these resources are spent in a way that is not optimized for a war effort, neglecting the physical threat to freedom and lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:33">[01:44:33]</a>. Some resources must be allocated to armaments, even if they don't directly improve the quality of life, because they contribute to security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a>. Military spending also stimulates technological advancements, creates numerous innovations, and drives the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:30">[01:45:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:05">[01:46:05]</a>.

The most difficult moments for the BBN head have included the expectation of two Russian missiles falling on Polish territory, killing citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:53">[01:51:53]</a>, and the four-week period of the Wagner group's deployment in Belarus and the intrusion of armed helicopters into Polish airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:28">[01:52:28]</a>.

Sending troops to Ukraine should be a last resort, as the primary goal is to win the war without engaging Polish soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>. All options for supporting Ukraine should remain on the table, including providing long-range missiles, aid packages, and increasing production of Soviet-caliber ammunition within Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>.

Currently, the risk of nuclear war is assessed as the lowest it has been throughout Russia's aggression against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>. Last year, the risk was considered much higher, both for tactical nuclear weapons and asymmetric actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.

The integration of artificial intelligence and robotics is leading towards a future where robots will possess senses and perceive the world [00:00:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">00:00:18</a>). For a robot to perceive its environment, it must be equipped with sensors that collect data from the outside world [00:06:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">00:06:14</a>). Without data, robots cannot make decisions [00:06:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">00:06:41</a>).

## Current State of Robot Senses

In recent years, significant [[advances_in_robotics_and_ai_integration | developments]] have occurred in data processing tools for sound and images [00:06:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">00:06:46</a>). Robots can now process visual and auditory information, enabling them to identify objects in pictures or recognize individuals [00:06:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">00:06:54</a>). This allows the robot's program to make decisions and perform specific actions [00:07:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">00:07:07</a>).

Multimodal training, processing not only text but also images and sound, is enhancing the capabilities of AI models used in robotics [00:20:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">00:20:23</a>). The combination of these factors will lead to even greater possibilities for models [00:20:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">00:20:38</a>). High-level control of robots could potentially be managed by advanced AI like GPT-like models, planning actions based on text data [00:21:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">00:21:01</a>).

## Challenges in Specific Sensory Development

### Touch
Developing a sense of touch for robots is considerably more difficult than sight or hearing [00:07:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">00:07:17</a>).
Key challenges include:
*   **Hardware Design** It is challenging to design sensors that can accurately receive specific tactile information [00:07:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">00:07:22</a>).
*   **Consumer Demand and Cost** Progress in robotics often aligns with aspects that benefit a wider society [00:07:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">00:07:37</a>). For senses like vision, consumer demand for better cameras drives technological [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | development]], making the technology cheaper and more accessible for robotics [00:07:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">00:07:49</a>). For touch, there isn't a comparable consumer application to drive initial technological breakthroughs [00:07:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">00:07:59</a>). The initial versions of new sensors are often very expensive due to a lack of scale effect [00:08:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">00:08:09</a>).
*   **Data Collection** Unlike passive observation (e.g., taking a photo), collecting tactile data requires active interaction with the world [00:09:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">00:09:01</a>). A robot would need to touch everything to gather data, which increases the risk of making mistakes or engaging in unwanted interactions [00:09:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">00:09:12</a>).

### Smell
The [[anatomical_structure_and_biomechanics_in_robotics | development]] of a sense of smell in robotics is highly unexplored [00:09:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">00:09:38</a>). Challenges include the biological and chemical safety aspects of digitally processing or transmitting scents to human receptors [00:09:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">00:09:55</a>).

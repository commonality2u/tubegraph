## The Unification Challenge

The universe is described by two major theories developed over 2,000 years of research: [[Relativity and quantum gravity | the theory of relativity]] and [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:43">[01:52:43]</a>. [[Relativity and quantum gravity | The theory of relativity]] describes "great things" such as the Big Bang and quasars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:14">[02:01:14]</a>, while [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum theory]] describes "small things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>.

Despite their individual successes, these two "arms" of nature—[[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] and [[Relativity and quantum gravity | relativity]]—are not compatible; attempts to combine them lead to theoretical "explosions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. The biggest problem in physics is therefore how to combine the macroscale theory ([[Relativity and quantum gravity | relativity]]) with the microscale theory ([[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:48">[02:35:48]</a>.

Decades of attempts to add [[Quantum mechanics and gravitational interactions | quantum corrections]] to Einstein's classical theory or to add gravity to [[Quantum mechanics and gravitational interactions | quantum mechanics]] have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. According to many scientists, physics strives for unification, combining [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] with [[Relativity and quantum gravity | the theory of relativity]] to create a relativistic theory of [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Many of the best scientific minds, including Heisenberg and Wolfgang Pauli, tried to combine the mean with [[Relativity and quantum gravity | the theory of relativity]] but failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

## String Theory as a Candidate

The leading and currently only theory that could combine both concepts is [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | string theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:20">[02:44:20]</a>. It is a very controversial theory, as its correctness cannot be definitively known or tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | String theory]] is currently the only theory that allows for the combination of [[Quantum and classical physics differences | these two fields]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a> and the only one that has survived these unification attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

### Concept and Dimensions
[[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | String theory]] is, in simplified terms, a theory of music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. Subatomic particles (like protons, neutrons, and neutrinos) are seen as different vibrations of a tiny string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. Particles are notes created by a vibrating string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Physics represents the laws of harmony of these vibrating strings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Chemistry is the theory of the interaction of these strings which form particles and matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. The universe is a symphony of strings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

An early version of [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | string theory]] suggested it would only work if space-time had 26 dimensions (one time, 25 space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Later, better versions proposed 10 or 11 dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | String theory]] is the only scientific theory that dictates its own dimensions, unlike Newton's laws which can exist in any number of dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. For [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | string theory]] to be stable, it requires 10 or 11 dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. This theory suggests the Big Bang occurred in 11 dimensions, not as an ordinary three-dimensional explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.

### Limitations and Implications
[[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | String theory]] cannot be tested because it speaks of particles whose energy far exceeds what can be produced on Earth; humanity is currently too primitive to investigate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. Despite its controversial nature and current lack of empirical evidence, there is no competing theory as sophisticated as [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | string theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

[[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | String theory]] is not just a theory of electrons, protons, and neutrons; it is a theory of music with notes higher than these particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>. Most of the universe is composed of dark matter, which [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity | string theory]] is developed enough to explain as another "octave" of the string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.

## Stability of Matter

A key implication of [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] is the stability of matter and the possibility of life. Without [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]], atoms would fall apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. In classical Newtonian physics, solar systems would collide and scatter planets, leading to an unstable universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | Quantum mechanics]] creates waves of stability, allowing for the formation of stable atoms and huge particles like DNA, which are building blocks of organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:04:00">[31:04:00]</a>. Photosynthesis and life itself would be impossible in a purely classical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19:00">[31:19:00]</a>. Humanity is a "by-product" of [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]]; without it, everything would fall apart into a fog of subatomic particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:04:00">[32:04:00]</a>.

## Consciousness and Quantum Mechanics

The exact structure of the brain and the nature of human consciousness remain a great mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:47:00">[33:47:00]</a>. While some believe ordinary mechanics can explain the brain through transistors and circuits, there's a possibility that [[Quantum mechanics and consciousness | quantum mechanics]] also plays a role, particularly in relation to free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a>.

Free will is defined as the ability to be independent and creative, without external commands or a prepared scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:00">[34:15:00]</a>. Robots, being mechanical and deterministic, do not possess free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:32:00">[34:32:00]</a>. If human consciousness is not merely calculations, then artificial intelligence with true consciousness may never be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>. [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | Quantum mechanics]] introduces uncertainty, which allows for creativity, thinking, and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:28:00">[35:28:00]</a>. Therefore, consciousness could be a by-product of [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>.

The concept developed by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose concerning microtubules suggests that a quantum element is needed for consciousness, stemming from the "collapse of the wave function," a physical process not fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43:00">[35:43:00]</a>. The argument for free will questions whether it arises from this part of [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a>. While there is no single theory of consciousness, it is thought that a machine capable of knowing and understanding its location in the universe and interacting with humans might be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:00">[36:31:00]</a>.

Professor Magdalena Żernicka-Goetz, a distinguished Polish scientist and the first Polish woman to hold a professorship at the University of Cambridge, has pioneered research into human development. Her laboratory was the first to study human embryos up to day 14 of their development, opening a new chapter in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Her work in embryology has been featured on the covers of leading scientific journals such as Cell, Nature, and Science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Science magazine named her discovery of a human embryo development phase the scientific breakthrough of 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Żernicka-Goetz describes her lifelong fascination with "the beginning of the life process, the beginning of our existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. She considers the hidden, silent stage of development within the mother's body, filled with dramatic turns and miraculous transformations, to be "the deepest mystery of our existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Groundbreaking Research: Extending Human Embryo Development In Vitro

Professor Żernicka-Goetz's laboratory achieved a significant milestone by being the first to conduct research on human embryos up to 14 days of development, a method they started working on nearly 15 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This period was previously inaccessible to scientists, often referred to as the "black box of embryonic development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

For many years, it was only possible to examine embryos during the first five days of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Further development required implantation in the uterus, which could not be replicated in a laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The method developed by her laboratory allowed embryos to develop for an additional seven days during a critical period when the highest number of miscarriages naturally occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

This achievement was groundbreaking because it enabled scientists to understand the crucial factors and cellular interactions vital for embryo development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. These mechanisms, previously speculative, are fundamentally important for a proper pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Human Embryo Models from Stem Cells

Building on these discoveries, Żernicka-Goetz's team created the first [[stem_cell_and_embryo_model_creation | human embryo models based on stem cells]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### What are Embryo Models?
These models are "living structures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]>. While not true embryos, they are embryo-like structures created from living stem cells that mimic aspects of early human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. They are not "exact copies," but allow for the reproduction of key processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. These models help study how cells interact, communicate, and influence each other within the developing structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### How Models are Created
The creation of these models is possible due to the "almost unlimited development potential" of stem cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Embryonic stem cells were first isolated in 1981, a discovery that later won a Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Professor Żernicka-Goetz began her scientific career in the laboratory of Nobel laureate Martin Evans, where she learned about embryonic stem cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Modern techniques allow for the isolation of extraembryonic cells, which form structures like the placenta, essential for embryo development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The embryo models are not made from a single type of stem cell; instead, they combine embryonic stem cells with two types of extraembryonic cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Under specific conditions, these cells self-organize into embryo-like structures that can develop for several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This discovery was published in Science in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### Distinction from Natural Embryos and Limitations
Professor Żernicka-Goetz emphasizes that these models "cannot develop into a complete human organism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. For further development, a natural embryo needs to implant in the mother's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. These models are incapable of implantation and are intended solely for testing under laboratory conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Their purpose is to enable developmental research, not to recreate a complete organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

The term "synthetic embryos" is sometimes used colloquially, but Professor Żernicka-Goetz prefers to call them "embryo models" because they are the result of a synthesis process of living cells, not artificial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. She clarifies that no scientific publications confirm any group exceeding the 14-day limit for human embryo models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.

## Motivation and Significance of the Research

### Understanding Life's Mysteries
Professor Żernicka-Goetz's research is driven by a deep curiosity about "how we become human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> and "what the dance called life is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. She is particularly fascinated by the journey before birth, describing it as "the deepest mystery of our existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Every cellular decision in the first few weeks of development can have lifelong implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Her work explores how cells communicate and make key decisions that determine our lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

### Addressing Pregnancy Failures
A significant motivation for this research is the high rate of early pregnancy failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. Approximately 70% of pregnancies do not result in the birth of a healthy baby; 30% of embryos die in the first week, and another 30% in the second week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. It's estimated that up to 60% of all pregnancies end within the first two weeks, often before a woman even realizes she is pregnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Understanding these early stages is crucial to preventing these losses and supporting life from its first moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. Many failures stem from chromosomal changes or other aberrations in the embryo's cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

### Personal Inspiration
Professor Żernicka-Goetz's personal experience greatly influenced her decision to research human embryos. During her second pregnancy, a prenatal test showed that 25% of her son's cells had an abnormal set of chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. It was later discovered that these abnormalities were limited to the placenta, a structure that supports the baby but doesn't directly form it, yet originates from the same fertilized egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. This experience made her realize the importance of understanding why so many pregnancies fail and motivated her to dedicate her work to protecting life when it is most fragile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

Her research on mouse embryos, inspired by her pregnancy, revealed that embryos can eliminate chromosomally abnormal cells, particularly from the part that forms the baby's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Abnormal cells may be tolerated in the placenta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. This demonstrates the "extraordinary strength and plasticity of embryos" and their ability to "save themselves" when something goes wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>. She believes this knowledge could lead to new methods for treating infertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.

Another key discovery by her lab, published recently, is that most of the human body originates from just one of the two cells at the two-cell stage of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>. This highlights an early, subtle asymmetry in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

## Ethical Landscape and Public Perception

### The [[embryological_ethics_and_the_14day_rule | 14-Day Rule]]
The 14-day rule, established many years ago, serves as an ethical and experimental boundary for human embryo research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This day is significant because it marks the beginning of gastrulation, a "magical moment" when the embryo starts forming new tissues, and the body's axis and future structures begin to arrange themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Adherence to such boundaries is crucial for conducting research with respect for life and maintaining public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>.

### Misunderstandings and Controversies
Professor Żernicka-Goetz notes that there is significant misunderstanding surrounding embryo research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. People often confuse laboratory embryos with those developing in a woman's body, or imagine scientists creating humans in test tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. In reality, the research aims to understand basic biological mechanisms to protect life and prevent early pregnancy failures, similar to how heart research aims to prevent heart attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>. The difficulty in explaining complex science simply contributes to these misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.

### Forbidden Manipulations
While ethical limits are important, Professor Żernicka-Goetz states that manipulation of human embryos for purposes "inconsistent with knowledge, ethics and the good of man" should be strictly prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>. This includes attempts to create hybrid organisms with the intention of developing them outside the laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. The line between research and [[genetic_modification_and_the_future_of_humanity | human engineering]] must be clearly drawn and guarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.

## Tools and Collaborations

### Role of Animal Models
The laboratory studies natural mouse embryos as an excellent model for understanding human development, as their initial stages are very similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. However, beyond the first week, mouse and human embryo development diverge significantly, necessitating research on human cells and cells from other primates for a more complete understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. Research using [[techniques_for_creating_and_sustaining_human_brain_organoids | organoid]] structures is also undertaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Application of [[risks_and_ethics_of_ai_development | Artificial Intelligence]]
[[risks_and_ethics_of_ai_development | Artificial intelligence]] plays a "supporting but very useful role" in the research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. AI is used to determine which embryos develop most normally and have the greatest developmental potential, for example, by analyzing recordings of mouse embryo development to predict successful outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

## The Journey of a Scientist: Professor Żernicka-Goetz's Path

Born in communist Poland, Żernicka-Goetz experienced political changes that opened borders during her studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. She completed her PhD at the University of Warsaw under pioneering mammalian embryologist Andrzej Tarkowski <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>. A scholarship allowed her to study at Oxford, opening new horizons, and she was later invited to join Nobel laureate Martin Evans' lab in Cambridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>. Although she initially planned to return to Poland, she stayed in Cambridge to establish and lead her own laboratory until recently moving to Caltech in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>.

## Defining Life and Humanity

Professor Żernicka-Goetz views embryos as "life dynamic, evolving, on its own unique journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. Beyond biological life, she ponders "what makes us human" and the questions of soul and consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. Influenced by conversations with her neurophysiologist father, she believes the "soul can emerge when the nervous system begins to form," enabling feeling, reaction, communication, and existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. The embryos her team studies are at an earlier stage, without a nervous system, preparing the ground for its later formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. She posits that becoming "someone, and not just something," occurs when the opportunity to respond appears, which requires the nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.

Her book, titled "The Dance of Life: How Do We Become Human?", reflects her belief that human development is a sequence of step-by-step processes, building foundations and then developing the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. Her work aims to explore "how it's even possible that something as precise as a human can come from such a small number of cells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>, finding "new worlds within ourselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.

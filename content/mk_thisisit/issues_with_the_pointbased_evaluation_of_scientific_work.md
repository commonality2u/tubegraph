From: [[mk_thisisit]] <br/> 

The point-based system for evaluating scientific achievements in Poland is widely recognized as a significant problem, often leading to detrimental outcomes for research quality and academic integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This system assigns specific point values to publications based on the journal title, with higher points theoretically signifying greater achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. However, this method is criticized for its arbitrary and nearly random assignment of points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## The "Trolling" Experiment

A Polish professor, Konrad, decided to deliberately challenge the system by submitting nonsensical articles to highly-rated (by the Polish point system) scientific journals, including some internationally recognized ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. His "protest against the system of assessing scientific achievements" highlighted major flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The articles submitted included topics such as:
*   The hobby of young Karol Wojty≈Ça (later Pope John Paul II) involving collecting matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   The influence of Catholic radio broadcasts on the moral attitudes of young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Several of these nonsensical articles were accepted for printing, seemingly after serious reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The authors' qualifications (a chemist and a musicologist with a doctorate in theoretical physics and a master's in the economics of socialism) were checked and deemed appropriate by the editors, despite the wildly unrelated subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. One article, poorly structured with undefined statistical studies and data analysis, was initially ridiculed on social media before the authors' identities were discovered, turning the situation into a widespread media story across Poland due to its comical and exotic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

The professor estimates that if reported, these fictitious articles could have earned around 660 points, which would equate to several years of serious theoretical and experimental scientific work for a chemist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The time spent on these fictitious articles was only about "d weeks of work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## [[pathologies_of_the_polish_scientific_assessment_system | Pathologies of the Polish Scientific Assessment System]]

The core issue lies in the point system itself, which is one of the major [[pathologies_of_the_polish_scientific_assessment_system | pathologies of the Polish system of assessing scientists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Arbitrary Point Assignment**: Points are often assigned arbitrarily, leading to situations where internationally recognized, high-quality journals have very few points, while journals of questionable quality have many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Some niche Polish journals, sometimes publishing only in Polish, received the same number of points as prestigious international journals like *Science* or *Nature* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Focus on Quantity over Quality**: The system incentivizes scientists, especially younger ones seeking scholarships and career development, to accumulate as many points as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This shifts focus from scientific discussions to strategizing which journal to submit to for maximum points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Rapid Publication Rates**: The system enables some scientists to publish hundreds of papers within two to three years, a quantity that is physically impossible to produce with genuine, high-quality work, especially when also juggling teaching and administrative duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **"Paper Mills"**: The existence of "paper mills" is noted, where groups of scientists collaborate to send very similar articles en masse to lesser-known publishing houses that are often highly scored in Poland. These publishers frequently accept articles for a fee, operating practically without editorial control or review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This highlights the [[acceptance_of_lowquality_articles_by_highranking_journals | acceptance of low-quality articles by high-ranking journals]] (by point score) in the system.

### [[impact_of_the_point_system_on_the_quality_of_polish_science | Impact of the point system on the quality of Polish science]]

The system is seen as having only negative effects, leading to frustration and disappointment among scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. It promotes publishing in easy-to-access, weak niche journals rather than striving for global top-tier publications, because both count equally towards achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This may lead to a sharp decline in the overall [[impact_of_the_point_system_on_the_quality_of_polish_science | quality of science practiced in Poland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

> "equating the best journals where everyone would like to publish... with journals where you can publish any nonsense written on your knees is unfair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Comparisons and Consequences

### International Perspective
In Western scientific communities, achievements are assessed based on successes like publications in the best conferences and top-tier journals such as *Nature*. There are no point-based lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### The "National Science" Delusion
The concept of "national science" is likened to the Soviet Union's promotion of "Soviet science" under Stalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. True scientific progress thrives in an international environment with a free exchange of ideas, concepts, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The current system, by valuing domestic publications equally with international ones, discourages global engagement.

### [[export_of_polish_scientific_talent_and_its_consequences | Export of Polish Scientific Talent]]
The system contributes to the [[export_of_polish_scientific_talent_and_its_consequences | export of Polish scientific talent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. Top scientists leave Poland because they lack sufficient funding for development or are frustrated by the hierarchical system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. While this is not a loss for global science, it is a significant loss for Poland's economy and education system, as the best minds leave, and their innovations contribute to other countries' economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

## Calls for [[impact_of_scientific_and_academic_reform | Scientific and Academic Reform]]

There is recognition that the system needs to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. The Minister of Science acknowledges the widespread concern about the point system across academic centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

### Proposed Changes:
*   **New Evaluation Philosophy**: Discussions are underway for a new point scale or an entirely non-point-based system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, possibly defined in an amendment to the Act on Higher Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   **Commercialization and Patents**: The focus should shift from merely accumulating points for patents to evaluating the actual implementation of patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.
*   **Innovation and Promotion**: The Ministry of Science has established a Department of Innovation to promote innovation and scientific achievements, and to better support the scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.
*   **Risk Investment**: The National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR) should be reformed to invest in risky, innovative solutions, which is crucial for fostering breakthrough achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Resource Optimization**: A "census of nature" or inventory of scientific equipment across Poland is suggested to ensure better utilization of existing expensive machinery, promoting cooperation between institutes and universities rather than redundant purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Priorities**: Current funding priorities lean towards security and cybersecurity, which will also direct funds towards Polish science and institutes in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

## Broader Challenges in Polish Science

### Funding and Remuneration
[[scientific_progress_and_funding_in_Poland | Scientific progress and funding in Poland]] are hampered by inadequate remuneration for scientists, especially PhD students, assistants, and adjuncts, forcing them to seek additional work or grants, diverting their focus from research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

### Public Engagement and Education
Public interest in science seems to be declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. The education system, particularly at lower levels, is seen as capable of killing interest in science by focusing on rote learning instead of practical applications and accessible explanations of phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. More scientists need to engage in popularizing science, but the current point-based system consumes time that could be spent on such initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

### [[recognition_of_women_in_science | Recognition of Women in Science]]
There is a notable disparity in leadership roles, with project managers and university rectors predominantly being men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. While no direct quotas will be introduced, the Minister believes that increased activity among women will naturally lead to more [[recognition_of_women_in_science | women in science]] and leadership positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. He asserts that the quality of teaching and research should be the primary criterion, where women will excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

In conclusion, the point-based evaluation system in Polish science presents a complex and deeply problematic issue, driving perverse incentives and hindering genuine scientific advancement and international collaboration. While changes are being discussed, the path forward remains challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>.

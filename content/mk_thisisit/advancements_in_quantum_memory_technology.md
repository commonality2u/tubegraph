Polish physicist Michał Parniak has achieved significant advancements in [[quantum_information_encoding_and_storage | quantum memory]] technology, creating states in quantum physics previously unachieved globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This development includes a record-breaking quantum memory in terms of capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Development and Capacity
The project began around 2011, with Michał Parniak working on the memory as a PhD student with a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>. At the time, they were unaware that a similar memory was being developed in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Upon publishing their results, it was discovered that their memory was three times more capacious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. As of the recording, they still largely hold this record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

The memory functions by preparing a cloud of atoms in a vacuum, which are capable of absorbing light, specifically very weak quantum single photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. This device is designed to remember a large number of photons simultaneously, store them for a period, and potentially even process them by performing certain quantum operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

The memory essentially acts as a specific type of [[development_of_quantum_computers_at_iqm | quantum processor]], capable of performing specialized operations on light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Information about light is stored in the state of these atoms, particularly in their spins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

## Applications and Broader Impact
This quantum memory has applications in various fields, including [[quantum_metrology_and_communication | quantum metrology]] and [[quantum_metrology_and_communication | quantum communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. It enables the extraction of spectral information from photons, revealing the precise spectral lines of which a photon consists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. These spectral lines are imprints of molecules, for instance, from an atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. The technology allows for precise distinction between very close spectral lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

The research also contributes to a deeper understanding of the differences between the classical and quantum worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Michał Parniak's work involves creating quantum states of increasingly macroscopic objects to probe the quantum-classical boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. This includes experiments involving:
*   **Macroscopic Entanglement:** The record-breaking memory's ability to store many photons allowed for entangling many photons with those still stored in the memory, achieving macroscopic entanglement of an object of unprecedented size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Another experiment in Copenhagen involved entangling a mechanical membrane (drum) with atom spins, demonstrating a "hybrid" entanglement of incompatible systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
*   **Quantum-Classical Boundary:** The research explores why objects with more particles suddenly behave deterministically differently, attempting to bridge the gap between quantum and classical descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. Experiments aim to put mechanical objects, like a nanometer-thick membrane, into a quantum state, observing quantum fluctuations even at absolute zero temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[011:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[013:15:00]</a>.

## Quantum Metrology and Future Potential
[[quantum_metrology_and_communication | Quantum metrology]] is a practical field that builds systems to measure with enhanced precision by leveraging quantum mechanics to reduce quantum noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[016:04:00]</a>. This "squeezing" technique involves reducing fluctuations in light where it matters, at the expense of increasing them where they do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[016:29:00]</a>.

This technology is already applied in:
*   **Gravitational Wave Detectors:** Operating detectors in the US, Italy, and Japan use quantum light engineering to double the precision of gravitational wave measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[016:51:00]</a>.
*   **Improving Measurements:** The principles are applicable to various measurements, as every measurement has quantum limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[018:23:00]</a>.

The ability to extract and encode information more densely within the light spectrum holds significant promise for [[quantum_information_encoding_and_storage | quantum information encoding and storage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[019:08:00]</a>. This could be extremely important for telecommunications, especially for long-distance optical fiber transmission, potentially increasing data transfer by tenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[019:25:00]</a>. Researchers are also exploring the use of microwave photons for encoding information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[021:12:00]</a>.

> "Understanding the structure of [[quantum_information_encoding_and_storage | quantum information]] seems to bring us closer to how these quanta work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>.

### Imaging and Astronomy
The advanced quantum memory device may also be used to improve microwave measurements and obtain more precise information from single photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:00">[025:29:00]</a>. This could lead to more accurate images of cosmic phenomena, such as the event horizon of a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:49:00">[025:49:00]</a>. Increasing detector size to the entire solar system by placing them in space could further enhance imaging capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[026:07:00]</a>.

Another astronomical application includes studying cosmic background radiation, a remnant of the Big Bang, which contains fluctuations that can predict many features of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[026:21:00]</a>. While not entirely [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology | quantum physics]], the goal is to measure these microwaves more precisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[027:05:00]</a>.

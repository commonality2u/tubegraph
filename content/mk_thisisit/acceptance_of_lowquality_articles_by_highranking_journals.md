From: [[mk_thisisit]] <br/> 

The Polish system for assessing scientists has been observed to exhibit [[pathologies_of_the_polish_scientific_assessment_system | pathologies]] that lead to the acceptance of low-quality or even nonsensical articles by journals otherwise considered high-ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. This phenomenon is a direct consequence of the [[issues_with_the_pointbased_evaluation_of_scientific_work | point-based evaluation of scientific work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">00:00:27</a>.

## The "Trolling" Experiment

A Polish professor conducted an "experiment" to protest and highlight the flaws in the national system of assessing scientific achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">00:00:40</a>, specifically the evaluation of scientists' work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">00:01:17</a>. He submitted a series of "senseless articles" to several scientific journals that were highly ranked on the Ministry of Science's score list, including prestigious international publications like *Science* and *Nature* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">00:01:23</a>.

### Content of the Articles

Despite their high standing, several of these nonsensical articles were accepted for printing, seemingly after serious reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">00:01:48</a>. Examples of these articles included:
*   A piece on the hobby of young Karol Wojtyła (later Pope John Paul II) about collecting matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">00:02:01</a>.
*   An article about the influence of Catholic radio broadcasts on the moral attitudes of young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">00:02:09</a>.

The professor, a chemist by profession, co-authored these articles with a musicologist who also held a doctorate in theoretical physics and a master's degree in the economics of socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">00:04:11</a>. Editors reportedly verified their qualifications and considered them suitable authors for the topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">00:03:20</a>.

### Points and Effort

Although the professor did not report these articles to the system, internet users calculated that they could have yielded approximately 660 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">00:02:30</a>. In contrast to genuine scientific research, which often requires years of serious theoretical and experimental work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">00:02:44</a>, the fictitious articles took only "d weeks of work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">00:03:04</a>.

### Public Reaction

A "bomb went off" in Poland following these revelations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">00:03:37</a>. The situation gained widespread attention in Polish media due to its comical and exotic nature: serious, highly-scored journals were publishing what amounted to a "joke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">00:04:33</a>. The articles were not even linguistically correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">00:04:56</a>.

## Root Causes of the Problem

The professor's actions were a protest against the [[issues_with_the_pointbased_evaluation_of_scientific_work | point-based system of assessing scientific achievements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">00:05:01</a>. In this system:
*   Work is assessed by points collected for each published article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">00:05:16</a>.
*   Each journal title is assigned a specific number of points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">00:05:25</a>.
*   More points generally lead to greater success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">00:05:27</a>.

However, points were assigned arbitrarily and almost randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">00:05:32</a>. This led to absurd situations where:
*   Globally recognized journals like *Science* or *Nature* had the same number of points as Polish mid-range or even questionable publishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">00:08:39</a>.
*   Niche journals, practically unnoticeable on the international scientific market and often publishing only in Polish, received equal points to top-tier international journals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">00:09:13</a>.

This system encouraged scientists, especially younger ones seeking scholarships and career development, to prioritize points over genuine scientific merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">00:06:03</a>. Discussions in laboratories shifted from scientific discourse to strategizing which journal to send articles to for maximum points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">00:06:19</a>.

The professor noted that some journals that topped the point list, such as *Toruń Studies*, *Catholic Pedagogy*, or *Chemistry Metrology Education*, were not previously considered significant on the scientific market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">00:07:00</a>.

## Impact on Polish Science

The [[impact_of_the_point_system_on_the_quality_of_polish_science | effect of such a system]] on Polish science is overwhelmingly negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">00:09:24</a>:
*   **Frustration and Disappointment:** It causes negative feelings among scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">00:09:37</a>.
*   **Discourages International Collaboration:** Equating top international journals with low-quality local ones is unfair and hinders engagement with the global scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">00:10:36</a>. Science is inherently international, fostering exchange of ideas and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">00:10:15</a>.
*   **Decline in Quality:** Many scientists, seeing that a small, weak, niche journal counts equally, choose the easier path instead of striving for publication in the best global journals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">00:11:00</a>. This leads to a sharp decline in the quality of science practiced in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">00:11:00</a>.
*   **Quantity Over Quality:** It incentivizes publishing numerous papers regardless of content. Cases exist of Polish scientists publishing 100-200 papers in 2-3 years, a physically impossible feat if texts were properly written and proofread, especially alongside teaching and administrative duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">00:11:23</a>.
*   **Rise of "Paper Mills":** The system fosters "underground companies" or "paper mills" where groups of scientists send similar, often self-citing articles en masse to little-known publishing houses that publish anything for a fee, often without editorial control or review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">00:12:45</a>. These dubious journals often held high point values in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">00:13:06</a>.

### Broader Consequences

The system also contributes to the [[export_of_polish_scientific_talent_and_its_consequences | export of Polish scientific talent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">00:29:41</a>. Polish scientists who leave the country often create breakthrough achievements abroad due to a lack of financial resources or frustration with the hierarchical system at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">00:30:04</a>. While this is not a loss for global science, it is a significant loss for Poland's economy and education system, as the best minds leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">00:20:05</a>.

## Signs of Change and Future Directions

The professor's protest did lead to some initial changes, with one of the previously lenient journals, *Toruń Studies*, rejecting a subsequent haphazard article due to bibliographical errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">00:13:49</a>.

The Minister of Science acknowledges the widespread issue of the point system within the academic community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">00:26:08</a>. While current evaluations are ongoing, there is a clear intention to rethink the philosophy of evaluation for Polish science and universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">00:26:32</a>. This will likely be addressed during amendments to the Act on Higher Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">00:26:40</a>.

Key areas for potential change include:
*   **Shift from Patent Points to Implementation:** Instead of awarding points for patents (many of which are "reinventing the wheel" just for points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">00:27:10</a>), the focus should be on the actual implementation of patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">00:27:00</a>.
*   **Focus on Innovation and Promotion:** The Ministry has established a Department of Innovation to promote achievements and innovative implementations, aiming to be more helpful to the scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">00:28:00</a>.
*   **Investment in Risky, Breakthrough Solutions:** The National Centre for Research and Development should be reformed to invest in innovative and higher-risk solutions, encouraging groundbreaking projects that officials might currently dismiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">00:31:07</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Resources:** Current priorities include national security, cybersecurity, and armaments, which will direct funds to related scientific research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">00:31:37</a>.
*   **Inter-Institutional Cooperation:** Encouraging universities and institutes to cooperate and share expensive equipment, as much of the existing infrastructure is underutilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">00:32:44</a>. A "census of nature" might be conducted to inventory national scientific resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">00:33:32</a>.

The general sentiment is that the future evaluation system should be non-point-based, or if points remain, they should be based on an independent, international bibliometric system that classifies journals and assesses their rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">00:16:07</a>. However, even relying solely on journal prestige is flawed, as good journals can still publish erroneous work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">00:16:40</a>. The challenge remains in finding a fair method to evaluate diverse fields of science, as comparing disciplines like mathematics, physics, and medieval Portuguese literature is illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">00:15:21</a>.

Despite these challenges, the conversation and increased awareness signify a will and desire within the scientific community and the Ministry to seriously discuss and change the problematic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">00:27:28</a>.

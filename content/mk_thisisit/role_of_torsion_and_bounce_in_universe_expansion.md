The standard general theory of relativity posits that when a black hole forms, the matter inside collapses to an infinitely dense point called a singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. However, infinite quantities cannot be physically measured and indicate that the theory is incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## The Big Bounce Hypothesis

According to physicist Nikodem Popławski, matter does not collapse into a singularity. Instead, it collapses to a state of very high density, then stops, and begins to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This event is known as the "Big Bounce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This expanding matter cannot return to its original place, nor can it stop moving due to the non-static nature of spacetime inside a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Thus, it has no choice but to expand into a new space, which is interpreted as a new expanding universe on the other side of the black hole's event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This concept suggests that our universe was created inside a black hole that existed in a "parent universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. The expansion of the universe immediately after the [[big_bounce_and_torsion_in_spacetime | Big Bounce]] resembles inflation, characterized by exponential expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

## The Role of Torsion

A key component of this theory is the twisting of spacetime, a concept Popławski has studied extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. This "twisting of time," or torsion, is an additional quantity of spacetime beyond its curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. It is derived from Einstein-Cartan theory, an older generalization of general relativity from 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

Thanks to torsion, singularities do not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. Instead of collapsing to an infinite point, matter bounces non-singularly at extremely high densities, meaning there are no infinities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. This mechanism prevents the laws of physics from breaking down, ensuring that the new universe created inside a black hole has the same laws of physics and constants as the parent universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

Torsion becomes very strong at densities close to a singularity or the [[the_expansion_of_the_universe_and_the_big_bang_theory | Big Bang]], acting as repulsive gravity and preventing the formation of a singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>.

### Torsion and Inflation

Popławski's research in 2016 (reiterated in 2021) shows that combining spacetime torsion with the [[big_bounce_and_torsion_in_spacetime | Big Bounce]] and the quantum production of particle-antiparticle pairs at high densities naturally leads to an exponential expansion of the cosmos, thus explaining cosmic inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. Unlike other inflation theories that rely on hypothetical scalar fields and multiple parameters, Popławski's model uses only one parameter and predicts an inflation that lasts for a short time and then ends naturally, as torsion's effect becomes negligible at lower densities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>.

## Implications for Universe Structure and Observation

If every [[black_holes_and_universe_creation | black hole creates a new universe]], then we exist on the other side of the event horizon of the black hole that created our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This theory predicts a closed universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. If astronomers were to discover that our cosmos is a closed universe, it would strongly support this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Furthermore, if two black holes (each potentially harboring a universe) were to merge, the universes inside them would also merge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. This would cause an existing universe to suddenly lose its spherical symmetry and develop a "distinguished direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. Some observations of galaxy superclusters suggest such a distinguished direction, which, if confirmed, would support the idea of universes merging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

The theory also addresses the problem of antimatter, suggesting that processes shortly after the [[the_expansion_of_the_universe_and_the_big_bang_theory | Big Bang]] resulted in a slight excess of matter over antimatter, leading to the annihilation of antimatter and the dominance of matter we observe today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Connection to Other Theories

This concept is part of a larger [[big_bang_theory_and_multiverse | multiverse]] hypothesis, where many universes exist due to black hole creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. It differs from the "many-worlds interpretation" in quantum mechanics, as observers in this model exist in only one universe at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

The theory also stands in contrast to Stephen Hawking's earlier ideas about [[black_holes_and_universe_creation | black holes and universe creation]], and differs from Lee Smolin's [[cyclic_universe_theory | Cosmological Natural Selection]] model, which assumes that singularities lead to new universes with potentially different laws of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. Popławski's model, by removing singularities through torsion, ensures that the laws of physics and fundamental constants remain the same in the newly created universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

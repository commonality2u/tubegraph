Inuru has developed a groundbreaking process for producing Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) through printing, a method that significantly reduces production costs and expands the potential applications of light technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This innovation aims to integrate light and interactive elements into everyday objects, transforming consumption and interaction with digital content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The Innovative Process

Traditional OLEDs are expensive to produce, relying on classic silicon processes similar to microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Inuru's unique approach allows OLEDs to be printed, drastically lowering the price and making the technology accessible for a wider range of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This printing process uses approximately 99% less surface energy materials compared to classic methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

The process involves printing the plastic material under a printer, layer by layer, drying each layer until the OLED is complete. The resulting screen is incredibly thin, about 500 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. While capable of transparency, Inuru's current designs are not, as they use a special layer to reflect light from one side only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This unique method makes Inuru the only company in the world currently offering this specific technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Applications and Vision

Inuru's printed light technology allows for the integration of light into virtually any surface, from clothing and cards to board games and packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This enables the creation of interactive elements where light provides additional value beyond aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

Current and envisioned applications include:
*   **Board Games** The first product featuring Inuru's light, a board game with a printed, interactive screen, launched in the American market through Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Touching an element on the game board makes it light up for a given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Luxury Products** Initially, the company focused on applications like champagne labels to gain sufficient customer margin and educate the market on the technology's value in a high-paying segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Medical Packaging** A key future application involves medicine labels with small timers that can indicate when medicine expires by lighting up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This transforms packaging into a smart, interactive tool that helps patients manage their health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Clothing and Textiles** The technology allows clothing to change color or pattern by simply downloading a new design license, promoting durable products and reducing waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This aligns with [[innovative_recycling_methods_for_textiles_and_building_materials | sustainable consumption]].
*   **Reusable Packaging** Inuru envisions smart packaging that can be reused multiple times for different products (e.g., apple juice today, milk tomorrow) by changing the displayed content, contributing to a "closed-loop packaging" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Animated Posters** Luminous posters using Inuru's technology are already available online through displate.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.
*   **Future Human Integration** Marcin Ratajczak believes in a future of transhumanism where screens are integrated under the skin, potentially as glowing, animated tattoos or interfaces displaying physiological data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

Inuru's ultimate company goal is to create a world with less waste and to be the leading technology company globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. They believe the future of images will be moving images present everywhere â€“ on clothes, walls, sidewalks, and even road signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## Production Scale and Market Expansion

After 11 years of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, Inuru is launching a new production line capable of producing 8 million OLEDs annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This expanded capacity, combined with lower pricing, opens the door to broader commercialization, particularly for medical applications that require affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

The company's strategy for [[inurus_market_expansion_strategies | market expansion]] involves initially targeting luxury and gaming sectors to secure necessary margins and then moving into high-volume markets like medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. The launch in the US market via Walmart signifies a significant step towards reaching 300 million American consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Origins and Challenges

The idea for Inuru's technology stemmed from co-founder Marcin Ratajczak's childhood dream of replacing paper catalogs with interactive screens to reduce environmental impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

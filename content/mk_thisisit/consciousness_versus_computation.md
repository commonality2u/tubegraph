According to physicist Roger Penrose, the common understanding and naming of "artificial intelligence" (AI) are fundamentally flawed. He asserts that true intelligence necessitates [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | consciousness]], a quality he believes current computational machines cannot achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## The Nature of Intelligence and AI

Penrose's core thesis is that [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | intelligence]] requires [[consciousness_and_artificial_intelligence | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, and current computers, being purely computational machines, cannot gain [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. He maintains that [[consciousness_and_artificial_intelligence | consciousness]] itself is not computational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

> "The name is wrong; it is not artificial intelligence. Intelligence requires [[consciousness_and_artificial_intelligence | consciousness]]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>

He suggests that a more accurate term for what we currently call AI might be "artificial cleverness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This distinction highlights that while AI can perform tasks cleverly and powerfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, it does not possess [[understanding_and_consciousness | understanding]] or awareness of its actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Computers have become so powerful that people often "lose sight of what they are doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### The Turing Test Reconsidered
Alan Turing's idea of a "Turing test" to determine if a being is [[consciousness_and_artificial_intelligence | conscious]] through conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, while influential, is seen by Penrose as missing a crucial element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## The Limits of Computation

Penrose argues that computers are based on computational mathematics, which is a very limited part of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. He claims that [[consciousness_and_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] "simply perform calculations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> and are essentially "simple statistical machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

> "Computers are a special type of mathematical structure based on computational mathematics, which is a very limited part of mathematics." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

### Gödel's Theorem and Uncomputability
Penrose's views on computation and [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | consciousness]] were shaped by his studies in mathematical logic at Cambridge, where he learned about Turing machines, computability, and Gödel's theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Gödel's theorem indicates that there are mathematical truths whose [[understanding_and_consciousness | understanding]] "goes beyond their use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Penrose explains Gödel's theorem as the ability to construct a statement whose meaning a person can [[understanding_and_consciousness | understand]], but which cannot be proven using a given set of computational rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The core of this is the inability of a computational system (like AI) to know if its rules are true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

> "Because [AI] doesn't know that they are true. This is the whole point of Theorem G, in which it is about how to go beyond the rules. This is done by [[understanding_and_consciousness | understanding]] why they are true." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>

This [[understanding_and_consciousness | understanding]] requires awareness, a quality that allows humans to transcend computational rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Mathematical logic reveals the existence of "uncomputable things" and "uncomputable structures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Penrose believes that part of mathematics is not subject to calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

## Consciousness and Physics

As a physicist, Penrose believes that whatever creates [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] belongs to the physical world, not magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. However, he posits that the [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | physics]] related to conscious thinking cannot be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. In contrast, much of the physics we currently understand, such as general relativity and the dynamics of black holes, *can* be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

Penrose speculates that true [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] might be connected to a "special type of new [[quantum_physics_and_consciousness | physics]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a> which is "in principle uncalculated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This means current AI, being based on computers, "excludes [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | consciousness]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

### Quantum Reality and Backward Causality
Penrose suggests that [[consciousness_beyond_the_quantum_level | consciousness]] might be connected to [[quantum_physics_and_consciousness | physics]] we do not yet fully understand, potentially stemming from or going beyond the quantum world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. While the quantum world is still considered computable, the "uncomputable" element concerns a "fundamental unknown" in the quantum world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

He argues that [[quantum_mechanics_and_consciousness | quantum theory]] is fundamentally incomplete, assuming that quantum superpositions hold at all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. He believes [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | consciousness]] is connected with the "collapse of the wave function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>, a mysterious phenomenon connected with "backward causality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

Penrose distinguishes between:
*   **Classical reality**: Determinable and understandable through our senses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
*   **Quantum reality**: Can only be "confirmed," not determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. It behaves "very peculiarly" and operates on the principle of "backward causality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

He references experiments related to the EPR paradox (Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>, noting that while signals cannot be sent faster than light, one can conceptually "go back faster than light" in [[quantum_reality | quantum reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. Penrose concludes that until we [[the_role_of_quantum_mechanics_in_understanding_consciousness | understand]] how the quantum world truly works, we cannot transfer it to digital space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

### Nobel Prize for AI Creators
Regarding the Nobel Prize in Physics being awarded to creators of AI, Penrose expresses skepticism, questioning if it is truly [[quantum_physics_and_consciousness | physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. He considers such an award more indicative of "technological progress" rather than purely theoretical or fundamental physical studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

## Predictions and Risks

Penrose believes that current AI, despite its increasing power, will "not ever gain [[consciousness_and_artificial_intelligence | consciousness]] because they are machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. However, he acknowledges that AI will likely surpass human capabilities in many tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

The greatest risk in AI development is the widespread misconception that machines are, or can become, [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | conscious]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. If machines *were* to gain [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | consciousness]], the risk would be even greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. Penrose maintains that [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] is a physical process that we do not yet fully [[understanding_and_consciousness | understand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>, hinting that its true nature lies much deeper than current computational models can grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

From: [[mk_thisisit]] <br/> 

Mathematics is considered to possess its own inherent existence, independent of human creation or discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This perspective is common among mathematicians, viewing the [[role_of_mathematics_in_understanding_the_universe | mathematical world]] as having an objective reality that is merely uncovered by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## An Objective Reality
Mathematical concepts are seen as existing independently of human thought, not as a product of human work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The discovery of mathematical results is likened to archeology, where findings are already present, waiting to be unearthed, even if no one has previously observed them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. These results are considered objective and would exist regardless of humanity's presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

Mathematical existence is believed to be uncreated; it exists naturally and, in a sense, creates itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. For example, the concept of the number "3" is considered a concept that would exist whether or not humans represent it with symbols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

Mathematical truth is not subjective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. While the understanding or perception of a truth can be subjective, the truth itself, such as "2 + 1 = 3," exists independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Mathematics is highly abstract yet possesses permanence and an existence separate from humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Perceiving Mathematical Truth
There is a significant division among mathematicians between those who prefer a [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visual image]] of concepts and those who favor a more abstract or algebraic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. While some find [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visual thinking]] more accessible, higher-dimensional concepts in [[the_role_and_perception_of_mathematics_in_understanding_the_universe | mathematics]] often require non-visual or abstract understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

The human brain's three-dimensionality does not limit the understanding of higher-dimensional [[mathematics_as_a_tool_versus_a_divisive_force | mathematical]] schemes, which can involve n-dimensions or even infinite dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. While [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | visual thinking]] might be somewhat limited in this regard, techniques exist to think about higher dimensions in non-visual ways, or by using "tricks" to visualize them within a three-dimensional framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Systemic Prejudice in Mathematical Thinking
There may be a "systemic prejudice" against mathematicians who excel at [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | geometric thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Examinations in [[importance_of_mathematical_education and research | mathematics]] often favor a more direct, verbal, or algebraic approach over a visual one, potentially disadvantaging those who think geometrically due to the need to translate their visual understanding into a written form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. This can lead to visual thinkers performing less optimally in exams compared to those with non-geometric thinking styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

## Mathematics and the Physical World
The more humanity understands the physical world and its behavior, the more apparent its dependence on [[role_of_mathematics_in_describing_reality | mathematics]] becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### The Three Realities Model
One model describes the world as comprising three interconnected realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>:
1.  **Mathematical concepts**: Possessing an independent existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  **Physical world**: The realm of physical behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
3.  **Mental world**: Where physical phenomena are "touched" or understood mentally, as [[mathematics_as_a_tool_versus_a_divisive_force | mathematics]] itself is an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

The laws of physics appear to be regulated by [[mathematics_as_a_tool_versus_a_divisive_force | mathematics]], specifically a type that possesses a universal character and inherent [[elegance_and_beauty_in_mathematics | inner beauty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The deeper the understanding of the physical world, the more its subtle, sophisticated, and universal dependence on [[role_of_mathematics_in_describing_reality | mathematics]] is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

It is considered a dangerous viewpoint to assume that a [[elegance_and_beauty_in_mathematics | beautiful]], powerful, or universal mathematical theory must therefore be true in the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Instead, the approach should be to discover what works well in the physical world, which then often reveals an unexpected universality and [[elegance_and_beauty_in_mathematics | beauty]] within its underlying [[role_of_mathematics_in_describing_reality | mathematics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Examples include Newton's mechanics, which started from empirical laws (Kepler, Galileo) and led to general formalisms discovered by others (Lagrangian, Jer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. However, these laws, while appearing universal, were later found to have limitations, particularly with the advent of quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### Einstein's View and Minkowski's Contribution
Albert Einstein, while a central figure in general relativity, initially struggled with certain [[mathematics_as_a_tool_versus_a_divisive_force | mathematical]] concepts and intuitively grasping them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.

Special relativity did not solely rely on Einstein for its discovery, as many individuals contributed to its development, including Lorentz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Hermann Minkowski, who lived before Einstein, described special relativity in a highly [[visual_versus_abstract_thinking_in_mathematics | geometric]] way using four-dimensional geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. This geometric interpretation was crucial for the later development of general relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

Einstein initially dismissed Minkowski's geometric interpretation of special relativity as "mathematical smart talk" or "sophistry," not "real physics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. However, he later realized that this four-dimensional visualization was essential for progressing to the general theory of relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. The "relativity" in the name can be misleading, as the underlying [[mathematics_as_a_tool_versus_a_divisive_force | mathematical]] description of spacetime ultimately describes a real, absolute geometric object, rather than merely relative points of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

## The "Romantic" Nature of Mathematics
[[Elegance and beauty in mathematics | Mathematics]] can be considered "romantic" in the sense that it allows one to inhabit a world that describes reality yet feels like a "fairy tale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. This perspective highlights the imaginative and profound aspects of [[the_role_and_perception_of_mathematics_in_understanding_the_universe | mathematics]] and its ability to model hypothetical scenarios, as seen in George Gamow's stories, like "Mr. Tomkins," which explored physics in an imagined world with altered parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.

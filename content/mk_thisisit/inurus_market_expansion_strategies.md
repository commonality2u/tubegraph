[[Inurus innovative process | Inuru]] has developed a printing process for OLEDs, making them significantly cheaper and more accessible for various applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The company aims to be the best technology company in the world and contribute to a future with less waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

## Initial Market Entry in the United States
[[Inurus innovative process | Inuru]] launched its first product featuring its light technology in the American market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This debut product is a board game, notable as the first in the world to incorporate a printed screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The printed screen adds an interactive element to the game, lighting up when a certain part is touched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

The game is initially distributed through the Walmart network, one of the largest retail chains in the United States, with plans for wider distribution to reach 300 million American consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The [[inurus_innovative_process | Inuru]] logo is visible on each product package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to Commercialization
The company's strategy involves starting with luxury products and games because bringing new technology to market is "extremely hard and difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. These segments are willing to pay a higher price for the early state of the technology, which provides [[commercialization_challenges_and_collaborations | Inuru]] with the necessary customer margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This approach also helps to educate the market that integrated light is a positive and interactive element in products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Expanding Applications
Beyond games and luxury items, [[inurus_market_expansion_strategies | Inuru]] envisions several future applications for its printed light technology:
*   **Medicine packaging:** Labels with small timers could indicate when medicine expires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> or inform about expired medicine in a cabinet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. These intelligent packages would help patients regain control over their health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Clothing:** The technology enables clothing that can change color or patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, promoting durable products where patterns can be updated via online licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Reusable packaging:** Creating packaging that can be reused multiple times with changing content displayed on a screen, allowing the same carton to hold different products like apple juice, milk, or wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Smart environments:** The company believes in a future where images are moving and everywhere, on clothes, walls, sidewalks, and even road signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## Production Scale and Future Outlook
[[Inurus innovative process | Inuru]] is currently launching a new production line capable of producing 8 million OLEDs annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. This expansion, combined with a much lower production price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>, will open the way for new applications, especially in the medical field where affordability is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. This marks their first wave of broad commercialization beyond smaller case examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

The company's founders envision [[polish_entrepreneurship_and_global_market_strategies | Inuru]] as a "dragon" rather than just a "unicorn," implying a valuation of over a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. While headquartered in Germany with development, they also have a branch in Poland and are expanding [[global_expansion_and_market_strategy_for_tech_companies | globally]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The long-term goal is to go public on the stock exchange to fulfill their mission of promoting smarter consumption and less waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

### Challenges Faced
The path to [[commercialization_challenges_and_collaborations | commercialization]] has been difficult, with many dismissing the technology and laughing at the idea of light on packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. However, the company maintains that people desire such innovation because it is "fun" and "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The company currently perceives itself as too small in terms of production scale and turnover to attract significant interest from larger players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

### Near-Term Polish Market Availability
While the initial focus is on the American market, products incorporating [[inurus_innovative_process | Inuru]]'s technology are expected to appear on Polish shelves within the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. Luminous posters using their technology are already available for order online via Displate.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

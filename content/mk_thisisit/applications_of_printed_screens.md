Inuru, a company co-founded by Marcin Ratajczak and Patryk, has developed a process for producing OLEDs (Organic Light-Emitting Diodes) via printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This [[OLED printing technology | OLED printing technology]] allows for the creation of thin, flexible light screens that can be integrated into various surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The printing process significantly reduces production costs compared to classic silicon processes, making the [[technological_advancements_in_oled_and_light_screens | technology]] accessible for broader applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

The company's vision is to create a world with less waste by enabling products to be more interactive and durable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Current and Potential Applications

### Interactive Packaging
*   **Medicine Labels**: Printed screens can be integrated into medicine packaging with a small timer to indicate when the medicine has expired, or to light up when taken in hand to inform about its status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This creates "intelligent packaging" that can also be used multiple times for different contents (e.g., a carton that can display "apple juice" one day and "milk" the next) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Luxury Product Labels**: Initially, the technology was applied to luxury products like champagne labels, where the light acts as a design element and adds value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Gaming
*   **Board Games**: The first product launched in the American market is a board game featuring a printed screen directly on the game board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This screen acts as an interactive element, lighting up when a specific part of the board is touched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The game is being distributed in the Walmart network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Wearable Technology
*   **Clothing**: The thin, paper-like screens can be placed on clothes, enabling future clothing to change color or patterns by simply downloading new licenses from the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Skin Applications**: While currently an extreme, distant future application (10-20 years), the screens could potentially be applied to the skin as glowing, animated tattoos or even transplanted under the skin for a small interface showing physiological states (e.g., body temperature, oxygen levels) or notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

### Advertising and Signage
*   **Posters**: The technology enables "moving posters" and "shining, magical" interactive advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>. Luminous posters using Inuru's technology are already available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.
*   **Road Signs**: A future vision includes the use of these screens on sidewalks and roads for informing and guiding, replacing traditional road signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Other Potential Applications
*   **Cards and Newspapers**: The technology can be integrated into cards and even conceptual "Harry Potter newspapers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **General Integration**: Due to their flatness and thinness, the screens can be integrated onto virtually any surface where light can provide value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Production and Scale
Inuru's production line, which is described as highly robotic, is the [[the_first_factory_in_the_world_for_light_printing | first of its kind]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. The company is starting a new production line capable of producing 8 million OLEDs annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. This expanded production aims to make the [[technological_advancements_in_oled_and_light_screens | technology]] more affordable for applications such as medical products, which require a better price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. The company believes in a future where consumption is smarter and more interactive, with objects providing helpful information and status updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

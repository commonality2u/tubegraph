Berlin is home to the first factory in the world dedicated to [[Technological advancements in OLED and light screens | printing light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This facility is pioneering the production of light screens as thin as a sheet of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Factory Origins and Location

The decision to locate the factory in Berlin was a business decision, not an emotional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The founders, who emigrated from Poland to Germany in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, grew up and studied in Germany, establishing essential university contacts there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

The first pilot line for printing thin screens was built in Berlin due to the availability of the entire scientific team and background necessary to scale the process from pilot to mass production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Moving the entire team to Poland was considered too high a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Additionally, the highly automated system meant employee costs were no longer a primary factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Childhood in Germany as a Pole

The founder recalls a challenging childhood in Germany, living in a former prison refugee camp where 30 families shared one bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The 1990s were marked by discrimination against Poles, with burning refugee camps and negative stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Berlin, to the founder, smelled like delicate plastic and foreign foods, starkly different from communist Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Today, German society has matured, and the perception of Poles has changed, partly due to Poland's strong economic development and increased international traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## Light Printing Technology

The factory specializes in [[OLED printing technology | printing light]] in three colors: red, green, and blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This technology uses [[OLED printing technology | OLEDs]], which are flexible luminous elements as thin as paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

### Current Capabilities and Future Goals

Currently, the printed elements shine in one color and do not yet have pixels for complex images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The goal is to print full Ultra HD quality screens capable of displaying films and moving images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. Prototypes for pixel matrices were successfully printed in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. The main challenge now is to increase efficiency and scale the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. The first mass-produced prototypes of full screens are anticipated within two years if everything goes well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.

### Innovation in Production Process

The most groundbreaking aspect of this technology is the production process itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. Unlike traditional [[OLED printing technology | OLED production]] which relies on complex, expensive pad welding processes in a vacuum (requiring €100,000 to €1 million masks for shaping and costing 10 times more for the same output) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, this factory uses conventional printers normally used for paint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

By printing directly onto plastic foils digitally, the process is significantly cheaper and allows for the creation of [[applications_of_printed_screens | OLED elements in any shape]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. This is the first such factory in the world to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, with no direct competitors in this specific printing method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

The company's valuation is estimated between 100 and 150 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

## Challenges and Philosophy

The most challenging aspect of running the company for 10 years has been working with people and creating a mutually beneficial environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. The strong trust and loyalty with the co-founder, Patryk, have been crucial to their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

The founder believes money is not the primary driver; the vision behind the company is much larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. The aim is to use [[OLED printing technology | screen technology]] to help humanity by promoting sustainability and efficient resource use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. He holds that fear of technology is often unjustified, and [[technological_advancements in laser and photonic technologies | technological progress]] ultimately serves humanity for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.

## Poland's Role and Future

The company has started investing in Poland, establishing a sales office and planning to develop R&D and production departments for local customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. Future production locations will be market-driven, requiring regional presence for quick delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.

The founder believes Poles are naturally more inclined to take risks and pursue what seems impossible, a trait stemming from [[history_of_polish_technology_and_contributions | Poland's history]] of fighting for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. Polish politics has created a good environment for startups, particularly through financing mechanisms like VC funds from PFR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. The founder maintains a positive outlook on Poland's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

### Genesis of the Idea

The idea for light printing emerged from childhood observations of environmental issues, like deforestation for paper catalogs, and a desire for more efficient, digital displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. This "childish idea" solidified upon learning about [[OLED printing technology | OLED technology]] and its potential for thin screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## German Economic Landscape

Germany is perceived as being less free in its actions, with a "strange feeling" about its current economic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. While once global leaders in exports and football, Germany's economic dominance is declining, especially in areas like combustion engine cars where they were always number one in quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This decline is leading Germany to become more humble and return to original principles and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

Germany is currently catching up on a "technological debt," having previously been overconfident in its established industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. An example given is the German auto industry's initial dismissal of electric vehicles like Tesla in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Despite this, Germany is still a source of innovative companies, with a positive, principle-driven youth and a willingness for personal cooperation with companies like the light printing factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This collaboration and innovation speed are seen as vital for Europe's global competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

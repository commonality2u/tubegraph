The concept of energy is fundamental to understanding the universe and the processes within it, including life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Energy as a "Hot Potato"

Energy is generally treated by all systems "like a hot potato," meaning no one wants to hold it, and systems try to reject it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Despite this tendency, energy is a conserved quantity in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This conservation holds true based on current experiments, with exceptions like Einstein's general theory of relativity or a hypothetical extra proton appearing every billion years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

Systems will change their structure to get rid of as much energy as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This implies that energy, rather than just movement, rules the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

## Entropy, Chaos, and Determinism

A core [[fundamental_questions_in_physics_and_the_universe | fundamental question in physics]] concerns what it means for the [[entropy_and_the_fate_of_the_universe | entropy of the universe]] to lead from chaos to something that appears like determinism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Even though processes within cells, such as protein movement and reactions, are random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, a deterministic outcome arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

This emergence of order from randomness is attributed to a "principle of mother nature" that dictates how these random processes adjust and synchronize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This principle of synchronization is key to understanding how systems, from cells to the universe, exchange energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

### Cooperation and Emergence
When two systems that separately behave in a certain way are connected, new "emergent" properties appear while retaining traces of the old ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. This "adjustment" or "cooperation" where systems manage to share resources and work together, often by trying to get rid of energy, is critical for functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

Energy enables systems to remain far from equilibrium in "stationary states," where time does not significantly influence constant streams of quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

Astronomers have observed that the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way Galaxy are on a collision course and will eventually collide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Collision Dynamics
While this collision might seem catastrophic, it is not expected to mean the end of our galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The galaxies will likely pass through each other, then return, stop, and eventually merge to become one larger galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Andromeda is larger than the Milky Way and will primarily absorb it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Role of Black Holes
In the center of the Andromeda Galaxy, there is a much larger [[black_holes_and_universe_creation | black hole]] compared to the Milky Way's central [[black_holes_and_universe_creation | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. When the galaxies collide, these [[black_holes_and_universe_creation | black holes]] will start to fill each other up until they finally absorb each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This larger [[black_holes_and_universe_creation | black hole]] will then begin to absorb the entire galaxy cluster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

Our local cluster contains about four or five galaxies, but much larger clusters exist with millions of galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Eventually, these too will be swallowed by a supermassive [[black_holes_and_universe_creation | black hole]] <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. It will also start swallowing stars, with most of them going into the supermassive [[black_holes_and_universe_creation | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## The "Boring Era"
This process will lead to a "boring era" where a single, massive [[black_holes_and_universe_creation | black hole]] exists and endures for an incredibly long period, estimated to be around 10 to the hundredth power of years (1 followed by 100 zeros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This is the estimated time it takes for [[black_holes_and_universe_creation | black holes]] to finally evaporate through the [[event_horizon_and_hawking_radiation | Hawking radiation]] phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

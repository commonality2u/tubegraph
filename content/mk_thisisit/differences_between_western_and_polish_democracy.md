Professor Andrzej Targowski, a pioneer in Polish computer science, highlights a significant distinction between Western democracy and the political system that has been in place in Poland for 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. Despite Polish leaders, including professors, ministers, and the president, frequently traveling abroad, Poland's democratic system is characterized as not being a "Western democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.

## Characteristics of Western Democracy

According to Professor Targowski, Western democracy is defined by the division of three powers: the legislator, the executive, and the judiciary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. Without this fundamental structure, a system devolves into a "pseudo democracy," which leads to "bad results" for its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.

> The concept of "technology" is applied to governance, where technology is defined as "the process of bringing something to a result" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. In this sense, the political system itself is a "technology of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

## Poland's Political System

Poland's political system is described as an "uninnovative political system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. This implies a stagnation or lack of progressive development in its democratic structures when compared to the Western model.

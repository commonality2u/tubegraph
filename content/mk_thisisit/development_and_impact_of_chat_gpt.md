The team at [[technological_innovation_in_ai | OpenAI]], led by Wojtek Zaręba, spearheaded this revolution in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. At the time of its release, [[technological_innovation_in_ai | OpenAI]] was valued at over 100 billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The launch of [[development_and_impact_of_chatgpt | ChatGPT]] garnered attention from the biggest press titles worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Founding of OpenAI

Wojtek Zaręba, a scientist who co-founded [[technological_innovation_in_ai | OpenAI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, began his career with a meeting involving Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Before [[technological_innovation_in_ai | OpenAI]] was founded, Zaręba was studying in New York, pursuing a PhD in [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. He had published strong publications in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Zaręba met Greg (likely Greg Brockman, co-founder of OpenAI) in New York, where Greg presented the idea of creating [[technological_innovation_in_ai | OpenAI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Zaręba was among a group of people with technical skills who were also aware of the potential ramifications of [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | AI]] technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. He wanted to be involved in building this technology to influence its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Impact and Discussion

The launch of [[development_and_impact_of_chatgpt | ChatGPT]] in November 2022 sparked extensive global discussions from diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This dialogue is considered valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Prior to this, [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] was often discussed abstractly or within the realm of science fiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Now, many people are involved in the discussion from various viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### AI Capabilities and Generalization

There is a common misconception that [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | AI]] is merely statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, models like [[development_and_impact_of_chatgpt | ChatGPT]] are able to solve problems requiring reasoning that they have never explicitly seen before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. These models demonstrate generalization, meaning they were trained on specific data but can behave intelligently in new situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Unlike some algorithms (e.g., decision trees) that struggle when moving away from training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, the transformer architecture used in [[development_and_impact_of_chatgpt | ChatGPT]] shows robust performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The trends observed in these models are deeply understood empirically, though a full theoretical explanation is still lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Redefining Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

The concept of [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | Artificial General Intelligence]] (AGI) is often misunderstood as a single point of achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. However, [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | AGI]] should be viewed as a class of technology, similar to how computers exist in various forms (small, large, in watches, phones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. There will not be a single moment when a specific [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | AGI]] is declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

[[development_and_impact_of_chatgpt | ChatGPT]], for example, has already passed the Turing Test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Historically, the Turing Test was considered a benchmark for machine intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. However, this achievement went largely unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

Current [[development_and_impact_of_chatgpt | AI]] models can perform tasks requiring "superhuman" capabilities, such as writing high-quality poems where each line starts with a specific letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. While human-level performance will be achieved faster in some areas than others, models' competence is increasing across all domains, and in some areas, this level will quickly become superhuman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

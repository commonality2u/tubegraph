The prevailing view among many, including Nobel Prize winner Roger Penrose, is that the term "artificial intelligence" is a misnomer, as true [[Artificial intelligence and consciousness | intelligence requires consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Penrose asserts that computers are fundamentally computational machines, based on a "very limited part of mathematics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, and therefore will never gain consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. He believes that [[Consciousness and artificial intelligence | consciousness is not computational]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, a core argument against the possibility of machines achieving genuine [[Artificial intelligence and consciousness | intelligence]] or even [[Superintelligence in Artificial Intelligence | superintelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## The Problem with "Artificial Intelligence"
The speaker argues that current [[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | AI]] systems, while powerful, "do not know what it is doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. They simply perform calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, lacking genuine understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This perspective is summarized in the book *The Emperor's New Mind* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Instead of "[[Artificial intelligence and consciousness | artificial intelligence]]", the term "artificial cleverness" might be more appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Just as some mathematics students are merely clever at repeating what they've learned without true understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, [[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | AI]] excels at complex computations and pattern analysis but lacks awareness or comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

## [[Godels theorem and AI | Gödel's Theorem]] and Uncomputability
The foundation of this argument stems from Penrose's studies in mathematical logic, where he encountered [[Godels theorem and AI | Gödel's theorem]] and the concept of computability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Understanding [[Godels theorem and AI | Gödel's Theorem]]
[[Godels theorem and AI | Gödel's theorem]] is described as "incredible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a> because it indicates "things whose understanding goes beyond their use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The theorem essentially states that within any consistent axiomatic system capable of basic arithmetic, there will always be true statements that cannot be proven within that system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This is achieved by constructing a statement that effectively says: "You cannot prove me using these rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. If the statement were false, it *could* be proven, which would make it true, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the statement must be true, but unprovable by the given rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Computability and Uncomputability
A key aspect of [[Godels theorem and AI | Gödel's theorem]] is its implication for "computability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Computable means something can be processed by a computing machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, as defined by Alan Turing or others like Church and Curry, whose definitions were all found to be equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

However, [[Godels theorem and AI | Gödel's theorem]] demonstrates that there are "uncomputable things in mathematics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. A significant portion of mathematics extends "far beyond computability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a> and cannot be calculated using an algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

## [[Limitations of artificial intelligence | AI]]'s Inability to Transcend Rules
[[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | AI]] operates based on computational principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. However, it cannot "create his own rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a> because it doesn't "know that they are true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The core of [[Godels theorem and AI | Gödel's theorem]] is about going "beyond the rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a> by "understanding why they are true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

This understanding requires "awareness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a> and knowing "what you are doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, which implies [[Artificial intelligence and consciousness | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. [[Consciousness and artificial intelligence | Consciousness]] is what allows humans to "transcend the rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a> by grasping the reasons for their truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Consciousness and Uncomputable Physics
The speaker posits that [[Artificial intelligence and consciousness | consciousness]] is a "physical process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a> linked to a type of physics "we probably do not know yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. This unknown physics is characterized by "uncomputability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

While current physics, like general relativity, can be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, the physics related to conscious thinking is "in principle uncalculated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a> and "cannot be calculated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This means that although [[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | AI]] may try hard, it cannot achieve consciousness because it is based on computable processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### The Role of Quantum Mechanics
Penrose suggests that this deeper understanding lies in the quantum world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>, specifically the "collapse of the wave function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. He views quantum theory as "fundamentally incomplete and even in a sense wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a> because it assumes quantum superpositions hold at all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

While a [[Quantum computers and artificial intelligence | universal quantum computer]] might one day create synthetic consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>, it would require understanding how the quantum world works beyond its currently computable elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. The quantum world itself exhibits peculiar behaviors, such as "backward causality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a> and phenomena like the EPR paradox, which cannot be fully understood through classical reality alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.

### [[Nobel Prizes and Artificial Intelligence | Nobel Prizes]] and the Definition of Physics
The speaker questions whether recent [[Nobel Prizes and Artificial Intelligence | Nobel Prizes]] in physics, awarded for contributions to fields like synthetic neural networks (Jeffrey Hinton) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a> or the creators of [[Artificial intelligence and consciousness | AI]] and DeepMind (Denis Hassabis, David Baker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, truly represent physics. He suggests these might be technological advancements rather than fundamental theoretical physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

In conclusion, the speaker argues that current [[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | AI]] systems are powerful computational tools, but their fundamental nature as machines based on computable mathematics means they lack [[Artificial intelligence and consciousness | consciousness]] and the capacity for true understanding, as illuminated by the principles of [[Godels theorem and AI | Gödel's theorem]] and the uncomputable aspects of reality.

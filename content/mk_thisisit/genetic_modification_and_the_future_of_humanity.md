The advent of advanced technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), is poised to fundamentally alter human evolution, potentially bringing about the "end of evolution in the traditional sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This transformation will occur as humans gain the ability to directly modify their own genetic code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Role of AI in Genetic Manipulation

AI is a pivotal force in driving advancements in [[the_role_of_genetic_engineering | genetic engineering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Its application to other research and development areas, especially biology and genetics, is causing these fields to grow exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. By leveraging AI for gene manipulation and modeling genetic changes digitally, researchers can bypass initial biological experiments in test tubes, accelerating the process significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

Within a decade, the combination of AI and CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) methods could lead to tools capable of freely manipulating the genetic code of humans, animals, and plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

## Applications of Genetic Modification

The ability to manipulate the human genotype will lead to two primary categories of application:

### Therapeutic Applications
Genetic engineering will enable the cure of previously incurable diseases, creating a significant branch of the economy dedicated to [[genome_editing_for_therapeutic_purposes | genome editing for therapeutic purposes]] and [[modification_of_dna_to_treat_cancer_and_other_diseases | modification of DNA to treat cancer and other diseases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. This represents a significant step towards [[the_potential_future_of_personalized_medicine and targeted_therapies | personalized medicine and targeted therapies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### Cosmetic Genetic Engineering
Beyond curing ailments, genetic manipulation can be used for cosmetic enhancements, making individuals younger, prettier, healthier, or stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. This also extends to pre-birth selection, where individuals can select genes for their offspring, a practice already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

## The Evolution of Humanity

The development of these tools means that future generations will not necessarily be a distinct "homo technicus" species, but rather simply people with a "slightly changed genetic code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. This signals a fundamental shift in [[future_technological_advancements_and_human_evolution | human evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

While the human species, as currently understood, may evolve beyond its traditional biological definition, the vast majority of the population will still originate from "normal biological swarm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. The core change lies in the availability of tools for genetic planning and manipulation for both unborn and already born individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

## Ethical and Societal Considerations

The scope of actual genetic manipulation will be subject to ongoing debate, including legal prohibitions and the costs associated with developing and testing these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. Verifying the results of AI-developed genetic models against reality will be a critical stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. These advancements raise significant [[ethical_and_evolutionary_implications_of_human_genome_modification | ethical and evolutionary implications of human genome modification]].

The blurring lines of what constitutes "humanity" are already evident with the rise of AI and [[synthetic_humans_and_artificial_materials | artificial materials]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. As AI and its derivatives exhibit characteristics traditionally attributed to humans, such as communication and emotional expression, the very [[concept_of_humanity_and_technological_entities | concept of humanity]] is being redefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The perception of AI by future generations, who grow up with constant interaction with such entities, will naturally include them within the cognitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

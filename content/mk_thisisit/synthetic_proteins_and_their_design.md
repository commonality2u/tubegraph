Synthetic proteins are novel proteins created in a laboratory, marking a significant departure from all previously known proteins, which originated from natural evolution spanning billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This field is revolutionizing biology, moving it "out of the Stone Age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, by enabling the creation of entirely new structures to solve specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## The Dawn of Synthetic Proteins: Top 7

The breakthrough moment in the field was the creation of a new protein in the laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Top 7 is recognized as the first protein designed using a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, possessing a completely new structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This discovery showed that humans could now create entirely new proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. Top 7, created in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, initially had no function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a> but opened the door for designing proteins with precise structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Its name, "Top 7," was given by Brian Kuhlman because it was the seventh protein topology attempted that proved successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. The realization of its success came when experimental confirmation showed its structure matched the computer model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

## The Design Process

The design of synthetic proteins relies on advanced computational methods:

*   **Understanding Protein Folding:** The ability to design proteins from scratch became possible once the principle of protein folding was understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Data and AI:** The field benefits from an extensive database containing structures of about 200,000 proteins, which serves as ideal material for [[the_impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_protein_design | deep learning]] methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. These methods analyze data, identify patterns between amino acid sequences and structures, and accurately predict the structure of new sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Role of [[the_impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_protein_design | Artificial Intelligence]]:** Recent design methods are based on the use of [[the_impact_of_artificial_intelligence_on_protein_design | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. While companies like DeepMind focus on predicting protein structures, David Baker's lab focuses on protein design, viewing their activities as complementary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Challenges

The space of possible protein combinations is vast. For a protein 100 residues long with 20 amino acids, there are 20 to the power of 100 possible combinations, making the key challenge finding the best solutions within this immense space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Applications of Synthetic Proteins

The possibilities opened by synthetic protein design are vast, with potential [[applications_of_protein_engineering_in_medicine_and_technology | applications in medicine and technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

*   **Medicine:**
    *   Creating precise drugs to effectively treat diseases while minimizing side effects, such as those seen in anti-cancer therapies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

    *   Removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to combat climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Technology:**
    *   Opening the way for the creation of innovative [[synthetic_humans_and_artificial_materials | materials]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   Developing advanced measurement tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
    *   Creating new kinds of hybrid [[synthetic_humans_and_artificial_materials | materials]] similar to teeth and bones that involve proteins interacting with inorganic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.
    *   Developing catalysts for various chemical reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
    *   The creation of [[development_of_biological_processors_using_living_cells | new biological machines]], particularly at the protein level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
    *   **Synthetic Olfactory Receptors:** David Baker's laboratory created the first synthetic olfactory receptor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, which may lead to creating new proteins capable of detecting many different types of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. This research aims to place sensors that detect molecules directly in silicon chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>, cell phones, and connect proteins with electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. The potential of such an electronic nose is to detect many more compounds than a human can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

## From Stone Age to Advanced Engineering

Professor David Baker emphasizes that today's biological engineering resembles early engineering from 100,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, when humans only used what they found in the environment or made minor modifications to natural elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This is why he advocates for "taking biology out of the Stone Age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

The analogy used is that instead of trying to modify birds to fly, humans discovered aerodynamics to build planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Similarly, in biology, instead of solely relying on existing natural proteins and minor modifications, scientists can now design completely new structures from scratch to solve specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Predicting the future of science and technology is challenging, as breakthroughs are often unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. However, the field of synthetic proteins is poised for significant impact. While the concept of [[creation_and_implications_of_super_artificial_intelligence | super human artificial intelligence]] (AGI) is a complex topic, computers are expected to become increasingly capable of performing most human tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. The internal states of such AGI, or artificial consciousness, remain a mystery given the current lack of understanding of human consciousness itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

David Baker, a Nobel laureate in Chemistry, believes his achievements will have a substantial impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. He anticipates that future generations of scientists, including current PhD and master's students in his group, will achieve even more amazing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

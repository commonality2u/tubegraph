Professor Dawid Kielak, a mathematician at the University of Oxford, identifies the theorem on fibration as his most significant mathematical statement and greatest discovery to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This achievement, alongside his work on the "symmetry of all symmetries," was a major factor in him receiving the Whitehead Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. His work on this theorem also contributed to his professorship at Oxford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Conceptual Foundation

The theorem on fibration seeks a way to understand the world similar to how Einstein viewed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Einstein recognized that we live in a four-dimensional space, but we perceive ourselves as three-dimensional beings whose world changes over time, as time plays a distinct role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Mathematically, this concept is described using the formulation "fiberization on a circle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. It posits that four-dimensional space-time "fiberizes over a circle," meaning it can be understood as a one-dimensionally lower space that dynamically changes in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## The Core Problem and Kielak's Contribution

Professor Kielak's specific interest lies in determining whether a given space "fiberizes over a circle" and if it can be understood as a simpler system changing dynamically in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. He discovered that this can be determined by examining certain [[algebraic_topology_and_fiberization_theorems | algebraic properties]] of the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

His method involves "squeezing out" invariants (numbers or objects) from the space and analyzing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. For example, if a specific invariant number is zero, the space will fiberize; if it's not zero, it won't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Kielak arrived at this theorem by generalizing an existing proof for a very specific case of a similar theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. While the original proof was approached by a topologist, Kielak, being more of an algebraist, recognized how to apply the underlying algebra to make the theorem general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Practical Applications

Currently, there are no immediate, everyday practical applications for this specific theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Kielak draws a parallel to Newton's invention of differential calculus, whose applications took centuries to emerge and now underpin nearly all science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. He also references Alan Turing's work on computation, which eventually led to practical machines used for complex calculations like particle collisions and nuclear reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. While not claiming his work will have such a broad impact, he emphasizes that the long-term utility of fundamental mathematical discoveries is often unforeseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

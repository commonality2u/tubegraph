## Classical vs. Quantum Worlds
The world we commonly experience consists of large objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. However, matter is ultimately made of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, which are incredibly small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Atoms do not behave like everyday objects such as trams or ping-pong balls; they exist and operate in a fundamentally different world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This [[quantum_and_classical_worlds_understanding | quantum world]] is alien to our direct experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | Quantum Mechanics]] and Observation
[[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | Quantum mechanics]] is described as a theory of our observations of the microworld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. While observing macroscopic objects generally has negligible effect on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, observing quantum objects completely changes our knowledge about them, and often their state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. For instance, the photons used to observe quantum phenomena can disrupt what is being observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This contrasts with observing the moon, where the light used for observation has a negligible effect on its physical properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The act of observation in the microscopic stage is active and changes our information about the object, which is a key to understanding [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Teleportation
Teleportation, as it relates to quantum physics, is an artificial process that does not occur naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. It is crucial to understand that teleportation does **not** involve the transfer of matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Instead, as quoted by Den Greenberger, only the "soul" (or rather, the quantum state/information) is transferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

For teleportation to occur, an object whose state will be transformed must already be waiting at the target location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The process typically involves maximally [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | entangled]] particles that form a "teleportation channel," often referred to as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### The Bell Measurement in Teleportation
A key step in quantum teleportation is performing a Bell measurement on the particle whose state is to be teleported, along with an auxiliary particle from the [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | entangled]] pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This measurement completely erases the information about the state of these particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a> and yields one of four possible results for a single photon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. For instance, in the case of photon polarization, there are only two possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Limitations of Teleporting Large Objects
While elementary particles can be teleported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, teleporting a human being or even a more complicated object like a glass is currently considered impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The process for such objects would require resources beyond the technical possibilities of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. For a glass, for example, the number of possible Bell states that would need to be controlled is astronomically large (e.g., 10^25 or 10^26 atoms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

Even teleporting an atom in an arbitrary state is considered impossible because of the infinite number of possible energy states for electrons in an atom, such as a hydrogen atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. This would necessitate a Bell measurement with infinitely many outcomes, which is not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. So, the thesis that one can never "teleport an object" but rather its state remains true, meaning the receiving object must already be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.

## Pioneering Research and the Nobel Prize
Research on [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] has advanced significantly, particularly concerning fundamental concepts like Bell's theorem. The speaker collaborated with Anton Zeilinger, a 2022 Nobel Prize winner, whose work built upon these foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

### Collaboration with Anton Zeilinger
The speaker's collaborative work with Anton Zeilinger began in 1991 when Zeilinger invited him to be a visiting professor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. During this time, they focused on the interference of independent single photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. Initially, they thought such interference was impossible, but they discovered a hidden assumption related to time resolution, which, when broken, allowed independent photons to interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. This understanding led to a paper showing the possibility of entanglement exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

Zeilinger's Nobel Prize was awarded for studies on [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | entangled]] photons, showing the violation of the Bell inequality, and for pioneering experiments on [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum information]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. This included work on teleportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

### Bell's Theorem and Paradoxical Situations
Bell's theorem highlights the gap between phenomena explainable by classical mechanics and relativity, and those that are purely [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanical]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. The speaker's own research in this area faced strong opposition from colleagues initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>, who felt the topic was settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. However, the speaker persisted due to the intellectual shock caused by these concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. Bell's theorem reveals "absolutely paradoxical" situations in the [[quantum_and_classical_worlds_understanding | quantum world]] compared to the macroscopic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

### The Nature of Entanglement
[[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | Entanglement]] occurs everywhere, even in the basic state of a hydrogen atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. The phenomenon of parametric conversion is particularly beautiful and important for creating [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | entangled]] photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. In this process, a crystal generates pairs of photons, where the appearance of one photon in a certain position implies its "brother" will appear symmetrically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. These photons can be polarized, and their polarization can be [[quantum_entanglement_and_spacetime_tunnels | entangled]] in a way that, if one photon's polarization is unknown, its entangled partner's polarization is also unknown until a measurement is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. This specific property of parametric conversion was discovered by a large group of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a> and was used in teleportation experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations in Physics
The discussion touches upon the ethical implications of massive spending on projects like a second Large Hadron Collider. While the collisions created in such accelerators are natural processes (unlike teleportation, which is artificial) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, the question arises whether creating "unnatural states" justifies the enormous cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Such projects lead to technical achievements and a deeper understanding of matter states, bringing us closer to understanding the early universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. However, it also raises concerns about diverting funds from other research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

## Polish Scientists and the Nobel Prize
It is believed that there is a pool of Polish scientists who are very close to receiving the Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>. However, Poland's spending on science (around 3% of GDP) is significantly lower than leading countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>, and the country experiences a "brain drain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. Despite this, some individuals, like Wojtek Å»urek, are recognized as being very close to receiving the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. The Nobel Committee's preference for experimental verification of theories, as seen with Trautman's work, is also a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.

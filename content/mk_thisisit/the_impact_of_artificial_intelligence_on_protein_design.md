The field of protein design has been significantly transformed by the advent of [[Artificial intelligence and its impact on physics | artificial intelligence]] (AI), marking a departure from traditional biological engineering methods. This shift is likened to moving biology "out of the Stone Age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

## Pioneering Synthetic Proteins with AI

A breakthrough moment in protein design was the creation of Top7, the world's first protein designed entirely using a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. Before Top7, all known proteins originated from natural evolution, a process spanning billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. The significance of Top7 lies in demonstrating that humans can now create completely new proteins with precise structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Although Top7 initially had no specific function, its creation opened the door to designing new proteins for precise applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Experimental confirmation that Top7's structure matched its computer model was an "extremely exciting stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

## AI's Role in Overcoming Complexity

The space of possible proteins is vast; for a protein 100 residues long, there are 20 to the hundredth power of possible combinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. The key challenge is to find the best solutions within this immense space, such as proteins that can cure cancer or break down plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

The ability to predict protein structure and design new ones has become significantly easier thanks to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The solution to the mystery of protein folding was found without a full understanding of the process, but rather through methods that work effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. This success is a result of work by many scientists since the 1960s, which led to an extensive database of about 200,000 protein structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. This database serves as ideal material for deep learning methods, which analyze the data, identify patterns connecting amino acid sequences with structures, and predict new protein structures with high accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

## AI and Human Collaboration

While AI provides powerful tools, human intuition and a human approach are crucial for identifying problems that can be solved by designing new proteins, such as addressing climate change or treating diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. AI will not indicate these problems on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

## Distinction from DeepMind

Despite sharing the Nobel Prize with co-founders of DeepMind, there is a clear distinction in their work. DeepMind focuses on predicting the structure of proteins, while Professor David Baker's team focuses on their design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. These are related but distinct areas, and the protein design work sometimes utilizes tools developed by DeepMind, making their activities complementary rather than competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

## The Future of Protein Design and AI

The impact of [[Artificial intelligence and its future implications | artificial intelligence]] is evident in various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. In the last decade, AI, specifically large language models like GPT chats, have brought about many unexpected breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.

### Applications of Protein Engineering

[[Applications of protein engineering in medicine and technology | Synthetic proteins]] are poised to have a huge impact on technology and in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
Their potential applications include:
*   **Medicine**: Creating precise drugs for diseases with minimal side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, and designing universal "Pionki" (perhaps "pawns" or "building blocks") to strengthen resistance to various threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. New biological machines at the protein level are particularly exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. Significant progress in treating diseases and developing more effective drugs is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.
*   **Ecology**: Helping break down plastic, neutralize pollution, and remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to combat climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   **Technology**: Enabling the creation of innovative materials and advanced measurement systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. This includes creating sensors that detect various molecules directly in silicon chips and cell phones, connecting proteins with electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. An "electronic nose" could detect many more compounds than a human can sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>. This research could even lead to transferring the sense of smell to the digital world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Unpredictability

Predicting the exact future of science and technology, especially in biological engineering, is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. Science develops in complex ways, and unexpected events often open new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. While AI is advancing rapidly, the question of whether it can achieve "consciousness" remains a significant mystery, as the nature of human consciousness itself is not fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>. However, it is predicted that computers will become increasingly adept at performing nearly all tasks that humans can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:00">[23:57:00]</a>.

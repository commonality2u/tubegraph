[[development_and_impact_of_chat_g_pt | ChatGPT]] is a product of Open AI, a company with representatives visiting Warsaw in cooperation with Ideas NCBR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Szymon, one of the creators of [[development_and_impact_of_chat_g_pt | ChatGPT]], describes the project's genesis and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Journey to Open AI
Szymon initially felt there was little hope for [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] after studying at Cambridge, viewing it as "some BS a bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. He then moved into [[the_development_and_impact_of_the_java_programming_language | computer science]] and distributed systems at MIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. His interest in [[development_and_impact_of_deep_learning | neural networks]] grew as a technical curiosity, focusing on how they could work across multiple computers to be faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

A pivotal moment was the publication of the work on AlphaGo while he was at MIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. AlphaGo demonstrated that significant progress in [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | AI]] was possible, showing that these networks could represent "some intuition" beyond ordinary search, akin to Deep Blue in chess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This marked AlphaGo as a crucial "scientific essay" in using algorithms to surpass human performance in Go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### AI and Intuition
The concept of [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | AI]] having intuition is explored, with the explanation that [[development_and_impact_of_deep_learning | neural networks]] can infer information from external data, internalizing implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. In the case of Go, the model sees millions or billions of games and can still play new games it hasn't directly observed, indicating it draws conclusions beyond superficial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Polish Contribution to Open AI
The [[development_and_impact_of_chat_g_pt | ChatGPT]] project was very large, involving many contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Polish programmers and scientists have had a "quite strong" voice in its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Specifically, Jakub Pochocki, a Pole, led the GPT-4 project and was heavily involved in optimizing the GPT-3.5 model, which formed the basis for the original [[development_and_impact_of_chat_g_pt | ChatGPT]] version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Factors Behind [[development_and_impact_of_chat_g_pt | ChatGPT]]'s Success
Szymon attributes the success of Open AI in bringing [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] into people's homes to several key factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>:
*   **Technological Development**: A strong focus on the specific [[development_and_impact_of_chat_g_pt | ChatGPT]] project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, unlike some competitors that may have spread efforts across more projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Problem Solving**: Addressing technical and organizational issues to ensure universal access for anyone with internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Universal Access**: The ability to provide wide access was crucial, as internal use did not yield the same effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The chat format, creating an "illusion of conversation with a live person," was also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This required solving complex engineering problems due to the high computational demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Future Development of [[development_and_impact_of_chat_g_pt | ChatGPT]]
Open AI plans both further integration of [[development_and_impact_of_chat_g_pt | ChatGPT]] with other [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | AI]] tools and the development of new versions (like GPT-5 and GPT-6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The company's scientific research core is dedicated to producing "smarter models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

Future efforts will focus on:
*   **Scaling**: Continued scaling of models, as it has proven effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Addressing Limitations**: Specific research will aim to overcome current model limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. One exciting potential use case is an "automatic scientist" capable of confirming scientific claims or finding mathematical proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Current models have an error probability at each reasoning step, making complex scientific problems challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Real-time Data**: There is a good chance that future models will work with real-time natural data from the network, which would enhance the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### Ethical Considerations
Open AI places high importance on [[challenges_and_ethical_considerations_in_ai_development | ethical considerations]] in [[artificial_intelligence_development_and_control | AI development and control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. The company believes that defining ethical limits should be a democratic decision, not solely made by a single company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Open AI's role in this is to provide technology to better collect public opinions on ethical standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

The second part of this ethical work involves the technical challenge of ensuring that the [[development_and_impact_of_deep_learning | AI]] model respects these defined standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Research suggests that "smarter" models (e.g., GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5) are inherently better at following instructions and complying with imposed standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### Multilingual Capabilities
Open AI is actively considering and working on improving [[development_and_impact_of_chat_g_pt | ChatGPT]]'s effectiveness in languages other than English, including Polish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. GPT-4 demonstrates significant progress in various languages, even less common ones like Swahili, outperforming GPT-3.5 in English on some benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Polish performance falls between English and Swahili <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. The progress comes from creating smarter models that can transfer knowledge from English to other languages due to their inherent intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. More high-quality data in other languages would further improve performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

## Microsoft's Role
Microsoft is a significant partner and investor for Open AI, providing computing power necessary to produce smarter models and contributing business experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. They also assist in integrating Open AI's technologies into products like GitHub Copilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

Crucially, Microsoft has no control over Open AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. This independence is deliberately maintained to ensure that decisions about powerful [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | AI]] models, which can impact everyone's lives, are not made by a corporation solely focused on investor interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Open AI's structure prioritizes its non-profit mission to benefit all people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

## Superintelligence and [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | Future Implications]]
The progress towards [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial general intelligence]] (AGI) or superintelligence is notable, with current models exhibiting more general skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Predicting exact timelines for its arrival (e.g., 5-10 years) is challenging and "basically impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

However, it is considered "wise to think about a scenario" where a strong [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]], smarter than the smartest people, could emerge before 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Even if the probability is small, it is something to prepare for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

## Szymon's Role at Open AI
Szymon describes his role as that of a scientist-engineer, focusing on optimization and distributed systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. On the GPT-4 project, he worked closely with Jakub Pochocki, addressing bottlenecks by implementing metrics software, fixing distributed systems issues, and assisting with scientific questions that hindered progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

Researchers at the West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin, Poland, are exploring diverse applications for algae, extending beyond traditional biofuel production to include agriculture and other industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The Oz 2.0 technology laboratory at the Department of Renewable Energy Engineering was created to demonstrate the entire cycle of microalgae biomass production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Algae as a Biofuel Source

Professor Małgorzata Hawrot-Paw, a microbiologist and the project's creator, leads research into transforming algae into various types of biofuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. There is no fuel that cannot be produced from algal biomass, including liquid and gaseous forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

### Types of Biofuels Produced
The laboratory's production line is adapted to prepare:
*   Biodiesel (fatty acid esters) – a substitute for conventional diesel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   Bioethanol – a substitute for petroleum gasoline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   Biogas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   Hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   Biolase (from pyrolysis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   Synthesis gas (from gasification) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### Production Process
[[photobioreactor_technology | Photobioreactors]] are used to cultivate algae, requiring light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrient-rich ingredients (fertilizers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. Specifically, red-blue LED lighting is employed as it utilizes the most photosynthetically active spectrum for algae, minimizing energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. The ideal temperature range for algae development is 20-30 degrees Celsius, with a maximum of 40-45 degrees depending on the species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

Harvesting can be periodic (7-10 days) or continuous, allowing for year-round production, unlike traditional biomass plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. After harvesting, algae must be dehydrated, which can be achieved through methods like flocculation (grouping cells with reagents), filtration, or centrifugation to obtain a concentrated paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. This paste can then be pressed for oil or processed thermochemically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

### Energy Independence and Commercialization
The project demonstrates how algae, in conjunction with photovoltaic panels, can help achieve energy independence for a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. The biomass acts as an energy storage, replacing traditional, often flammable and expensive, storage methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Bioreactors can be placed on a building's facade to capture solar energy and convert it into chemical components like carbohydrates, lipids (ideal for applications), and proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. This stored biomass can be kept for extended periods without losing quality or energy stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

While [[biofuel_production_from_algae | biofuel production from algae]] has faced [[challenges_in_commercializing_recycling_technologies | commercialization challenges]] due to economic factors and the historical price of traditional fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, there have been successful commercial ventures. Cars in the United States have been driven on fuel from algae, and the first flight of a passenger plane entirely on algae fuel occurred in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Algae in Agriculture

Beyond fuel, researchers are exploring multi-faceted uses for algal biomass. After oil extraction for biofuel, the remaining biomass, rich in carbohydrates and protein, can be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

### Biofertilizers and Biopesticides
Algae can be processed into slow-release biofertilizer capsules made from alginate, a substance derived from algae itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. These capsules decompose slowly in the soil, releasing valuable ingredients that support plant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This slow release is crucial as it prevents the issue of traditional fertilizers being applied in excess, which can lead to eutrophication of water bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Algae can also function as biopesticides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Other Industrial Applications

The versatility of algal biomass extends to other sectors:
*   **Pharmaceuticals:** The protein and carbohydrate content makes algae suitable for pharmaceutical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   **Cosmetics:** Algae can also be used in cosmetic products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Environmental Benefits and Unique Properties of Algae

Algae offer significant [[environmental_benefits_of_algaebased_energy | environmental benefits]] and possess unique characteristics that make them highly efficient:

*   **Oxygen Production:** Algae produce the majority of Earth's oxygen, not trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   **High Efficiency:** Algae convert light into chemical components more intensively and effectively than plants, accumulating significant amounts of valuable ingredients in a short time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Higher Yields:** On smaller surfaces, algae can achieve much larger yields. While energy plants might yield 19-20 tons per hectare, algae can yield 40-80 tons, with theoretical potential exceeding 280 tons, and currently achieving 120 tons per hectare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Wastewater Treatment and Nutrient Recycling:** Algae can be grown on sewage, effectively utilizing wastewater and its nutrients. This process not only provides water but also nutrients, eliminating the need to purchase additional materials for cultivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Growing on sewage can even lead to more intensive biomass multiplication than on synthetic media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Carbon Dioxide Capture:** Algae require carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, making them capable of utilizing industrial CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

The Polish scientific assessment system, particularly its point-based approach, has been identified as having significant pathologies that negatively [[impact_of_the_point_system_on_the_quality_of_polish_science | impact the quality of Polish science]]. This system assesses scientists and their work based on points awarded for published articles, with each journal title assigned a specific point value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

## Core Issues and Manifestations

The core problem lies in the arbitrary and often random assignment of points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>. This has led to several critical issues:
*   **Arbitrary Point Allocation** Very good, internationally recognized journals sometimes have very few points, while journals of questionable quality receive many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. This includes niche Polish journals having the same point value as globally recognized publications like *Science* or *Nature* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.
*   **Focus on Quantity Over Quality** The system incentivizes scientists to accumulate as many points as possible, leading to a race for publications rather than genuine scientific discourse or groundbreaking research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Some Polish scientists have published 100-200 papers in just two or three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>, which is physically impossible for original work, especially for those with teaching or administrative duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **"Papers" Phenomenon** A specific pathology in Polish academic jargon is the creation of "papers," referring to groups of scientists who collectively publish very similar articles en masse, often citing each other, in lesser-known journals that are paradoxically well-scored in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. These journals often publish anything for a fee, effectively acting as advertisement platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. An article can be rated highly (e.g., 140 points) with "practically no editorial control, without a review" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Inappropriate Specialization** Papers might appear in completely unrelated disciplines, such as mechanical engineering articles cited in immunology or ancient history journals, raising significant suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Professor's Protest Experiment

A Polish professor explicitly trolled the system to highlight its flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. He sent a series of "senseless" articles to several scientific journals highly ranked by the Ministry of Science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Content of Articles** These included topics like young Karol Wojtyla's hobby of collecting matches, and the influence of Catholic radio broadcasts on youth moral attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Despite being nonsensical and linguistically incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, several were accepted for printing after seemingly serious reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Acceptance** The articles were accepted despite the author being a chemist, with co-authors including a musicologist with a doctorate in theoretical physics and a master's degree in the economics of socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Editors verified author qualifications and considered them suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Public Reaction** When the true authors were revealed, a "bomb went off" in Poland, with virtually all Polish media reporting on the comical situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The articles garnered approximately 660 points in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, which would typically represent several years of serious scientific work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Consequences of the System

The point-based system has several negative consequences for [[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Poland's development in the scientific community]] and its scientists:
*   **Frustration and Demotivation** It causes frustration and disappointment among scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Younger colleagues are forced to adapt to the system to secure scholarships and development opportunities, spending time discussing which journal to send to for maximum points rather than engaging in scientific discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Decline in Quality** It may lead to a sharp decline in the quality of science practiced in Poland, as scientists opt for easier publication in low-quality niche journals that count the same as top-tier international publications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Hindrance to International Collaboration** The emphasis on "national science" — a concept previously associated with the Soviet Union — discourages scientists from operating in an international environment, which is crucial for the free exchange of ideas, data, and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Misguided Assessment** The system inappropriately compares and lumps together scientists from vastly different fields (e.g., surgeons and medieval Portuguese literature experts), making meaningful comparative assessment impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

## Comparison with Western Systems

In Western scientific communities, achievements are assessed based on successes, such as publications in the best conferences or journals like *Nature*, rather than an arbitrary point system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## Proposed Changes and Current State

There is recognition of the problem within the scientific community and at the ministerial level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Minister's Intentions** The Minister of Science and Higher Education acknowledges the issue and states that the evaluation system must change, with discussions ongoing across academic centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.
*   **Shift in Evaluation Philosophy** Future changes, possibly through amendments to the Act on Higher Education, aim to redefine the philosophy of evaluating Polish science and universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. The focus should shift from points for patents to points for the *implementation* of patents, as many current patents are merely "reinventing the wheel" to gain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
*   **New Department of Innovation** The Ministry established a Department of Innovation to promote and commercialize scientific achievements, emphasizing a supportive role for the scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **Challenges in Implementation** Despite discussions, little has changed practically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. While international bibliometric systems exist to classify journals independently, adopting an "inheritance of prestige" principle from journals is also flawed, as even good journals can publish poor work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Need for Cooperation** There is a call for greater cooperation between institutes and universities to effectively utilize existing expensive equipment and avoid redundant purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

## Related Challenges

The pathologies of the assessment system contribute to broader [[challenges_and_potential_in_polish_science_and_technology | challenges and potential in Polish science and technology]]:
*   **[[export_of_polish_scientific_talent_and_its_consequences | Export of Polish scientific talent and its consequences]]** The system's flaws, coupled with inadequate remuneration and lack of support for young scientists, contribute to the brain drain of Polish intellectuals, experts, and technology creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. While beneficial for global science, this is a clear loss for Poland's economy and education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Public Perception and Popularization** There is a perceived decline in public interest and respect for science in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. While science festivals exist, they are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. The [[polish_education_system_and_educational_reform | Polish education system and educational reform]] at lower levels can actively "kill" interest in science by focusing on rote learning instead of practical applications or interesting phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Scientists themselves often lack time for popularization due to administrative burdens and the need to chase points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion in Funding** Polish institutions tend to be risk-averse in funding breakthrough projects, leading innovative scientists to seek opportunities abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. The National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR) should be an institution that invests in innovative, at-risk solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.
*   **Gender Imbalance** There is a notable gender imbalance in scientific leadership roles, with women being "exotic" as rectors and predominantly men managing scientific projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. While no direct discriminatory policies exist, the Minister believes women's increasing activity will naturally lead to more female leaders over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

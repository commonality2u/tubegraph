DNA is described as the essence of life, defining each individual and dictating appearance, behaviors, and predispositions [0:46:00]. The length of human life is also determined by DNA [0:44:00].

## The Problem of DNA Damage
DNA is a molecule found in nearly every cell, and it is constantly exposed to various external and internal factors that can cause it to break or become damaged [0:20:00, 6:19:00, 6:33:00]. Types of DNA damage include:
*   Single-stranded DNA breaks [0:39:00, 6:40:00].
*   Double-stranded DNA breaks, where the strand is cut, leaving free ends [6:42:00, 6:46:00].
*   Errors in the genetic code [6:50:00].
*   The attachment of structures to DNA that prevent it from functioning correctly [6:53:00, 7:02:00].

The effectiveness of DNA repair mechanisms unfortunately decreases with age, which can accelerate cell aging processes and pathogenic processes if the balance is disturbed [9:57:00, 10:25:00].

## Cellular Repair Mechanisms
Human cells have evolved a comprehensive set of tools to prevent DNA damage and to quickly repair it when it occurs, maintaining DNA stability and security [7:08:00, 7:17:00]. For instance, the XRCC1 protein is a key factor in repairing single-strand DNA breaks [7:30:00, 7:34:00, 7:36:00]. Research has shown that this protein is delivered to the site of damage as if in a "tanker," with a "set of tools" ready to deliver molecules needed for repair or to connect free DNA ends [7:54:00, 7:59:00, 8:06:00].

## IntoDNA: A Technological Breakthrough
The startup IntoDNA, co-founded by Dr. Magdalena Kordon, emerged from research at the Jagiellonian University [1:03:00, 11:54:00, 11:59:00, 13:53:00]. The core of IntoDNA's work is its "stright technological platform" [13:26:00].

### The Need for Direct Detection
Previously, scientists studied the indirect effects of DNA damage or cellular responses, but lacked technology to directly prove the existence of cracks or count them [12:35:00, 12:48:00]. IntoDNA developed a highly sensitive and specific technology to mark these free ends of DNA or damages, allowing them to be literally seen, counted, and localized under a microscope [13:04:00, 13:13:00, 13:17:00]. This addresses the challenge of observing phenomena at a very low level, such as a few cracks forming in a specific place [12:53:00, 13:00:00].

### Applications in Medicine
The understanding of DNA repair mechanisms is crucial for developing therapeutic tools [8:45:00].

#### [[genome_editing_for_therapeutic_purposes | Genome Editing]]
Recent days have marked a significant milestone as countries like Great Britain and the United States have given the green light to implement therapeutic methods based on [[genome_editing_for_therapeutic_purposes | genome editing]] for the first time [0:02:00, 0:09:00, 3:48:00, 3:54:00, 4:02:00]. These methods are intended for treating conditions such as sickle cell anemia, marking a major breakthrough [4:07:00, 4:10:00, 17:40:00].

[[genome_editing_for_therapeutic_purposes | Genome editing]], including technologies like CRISPR, relies on intentionally inducing very specific types of damage in a precise location within the DNA sequence [8:50:00, 15:29:00, 15:31:00, 15:35:00]. IntoDNA's technology can verify if a [[genome_editing_for_therapeutic_purposes | genome editing]] system introduces damage where it should, providing functional detection of these damages [15:44:00, 15:51:00, 15:54:00, 15:56:00].

#### [[the_potential_future_of_personalized_medicine_and_targeted_therapies | Targeted Therapies]] for Cancer
IntoDNA helps companies and laboratories worldwide develop new generation [[the_potential_future_of_personalized_medicine_and_targeted_therapies | targeted therapies]], primarily in oncology [11:19:00, 11:22:00, 14:04:00, 14:08:00]. These [[the_potential_future_of_personalized_medicine_and_targeted_therapies | targeted therapies]] aim to precisely damage DNA only in cancer cells, minimizing side effects seen with traditional chemotherapy [16:06:00, 16:08:00, 16:15:00, 16:17:00].

Current [[modification_of_dna_to_treat_cancer_and_other_diseases | DNA modifying]] drugs already in the market, particularly from the DDR (DNA Damage Response) group, inhibit the repair of DNA damage, causing it to break in cancer cells [16:31:00, 16:33:00, 17:28:00, 18:05:00, 18:07:00]. Examples include PARP inhibitor drugs like Olaparib and Niraparib, used for ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers, which have shown very good effects and improved patient quality of life [18:15:00, 18:17:00, 18:23:00, 18:24:00, 18:29:00, 18:32:00, 18:38:00, 18:41:00, 18:43:00].

Another type of drug being tested is radiopharmaceuticals, molecules precisely introduced into the patient's body that attach to tumor cells but not normal cells [16:42:00, 16:44:00, 16:46:00, 16:48:00, 16:50:00, 16:53:00]. These molecules emit radiation (e.g., Alpha or Beta therapy) that causes DNA breaks specifically in cancer cells, leading to their destruction [16:59:00, 17:01:00, 17:03:00, 17:05:00, 17:08:00, 17:12:00, 17:14:00, 17:16:00].

#### Neurodegenerative Diseases
DNA damage and stability are also critical in the area of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease, which is a key interest for IntoDNA [11:33:00, 11:35:00, 11:37:00, 11:39:00, 11:46:00, 11:49:00].

#### [[the_potential_future_of_personalized_medicine_and_targeted_therapies | Personalized Medicine]]
The future of oncological therapies lies in [[the_potential_future_of_personalized_medicine_and_targeted_therapies | personalized medicine]], which involves accurate diagnostics, characterizing specific tumors, and conducting both genetic and functional testing [20:06:00, 20:09:00, 20:11:00, 20:13:00, 20:16:00, 20:18:00, 20:20:00, 20:21:00]. IntoDNA's solutions aim to complement genetic insights by providing a functional description of tumors, offering a better picture for tailoring therapy to individual patients [20:29:00, 20:31:00, 20:32:00, 20:34:00, 20:36:00, 20:39:00, 20:41:00].

## Ethical and Evolutionary Considerations
Interfering with the human genome on a large scale raises significant ethical and safety concerns [2:27:00, 2:48:00, 2:55:00, 2:58:00]. There is difficulty in assessing the long-term evolutionary consequences such actions could have on subsequent generations and the further development of the human species [0:18:00, 0:22:00, 2:21:00, 2:35:00, 2:38:00, 2:40:00, 2:44:00]. Some futuristic predictions suggest that in the next generation, humans might be so extensively genetically modified that they could no longer be called *Homo sapiens* in the traditional sense [3:01:00, 3:10:00, 3:13:00, 3:16:00, 3:19:00, 3:22:00].

## Future Outlook
### Curing Cancer
While a single "cure for cancer" does not exist due to the unique nature of each tumor, it is believed that cancer can cease to be a fatal disease in many cases [19:16:00, 19:18:00, 19:23:00, 19:26:00, 19:28:00, 19:32:00, 19:34:00, 19:37:00]. This will likely be achieved through [[the_potential_future_of_personalized_medicine_and_targeted_therapies | personalized medicine]] approaches [20:06:00, 20:07:00, 20:09:00, 20:11:00].

### Extending Human Lifespan
The continuous improvement in quality of life and effectiveness of disease treatment has consistently increased average human survival rates [24:14:00, 24:17:00, 24:19:00, 24:26:00, 24:27:00]. It is plausible that through DNA modifications, humans could exceed the age of 100 [24:04:00, 24:06:00, 24:08:00, 24:11:00, 24:28:00, 24:31:00, 24:34:00].

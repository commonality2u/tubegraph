Recent developments indicate a significant shift in medical treatment, with countries like Great Britain and the United States giving "the green light" to therapeutic methods based on [[the_role_of_genetic_engineering | genome editing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This marks a major breakthrough in the field of medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

## What is DNA and Genome Editing?

DNA is described as the "essence of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. It defines each individual, their appearance, certain behaviors, and predispositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

At present, scientists can significantly interfere with the human DNA strand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This includes:
-   [[modification_of_dna_to_treat_cancer_and_other_diseases | Modifying DNA]] sequences by introducing fragments that were not originally there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
-   Deactivating certain genes to make them inactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
-   Amplifying or duplicating fragments of sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
-   Intentionally damaging DNA to alter its function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

[[the_role_of_genetic_engineering | Genome editing]], specifically, is based on the intentional induction of specific types of damage in very precise places within the DNA sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. Understanding how the DNA repair machinery works is crucial for properly designing these editing "machines" to ensure effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

## Current Therapeutic Applications

Therapeutic methods based on [[the_role_of_genetic_engineering | genome editing]] are now being implemented for diseases like sickle cell anemia, marking a significant breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This is the first time in history that such therapies have been accepted and will be implemented in patients on a large scale in Great Britain and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

Regarding [[modification_of_dna_to_treat_cancer_and_other_diseases | oncological diseases]], certain drugs from the DDR (DNA Damage Response) group, which inhibit the repair of DNA damage, have been on the market for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Examples include PARP inhibitors (e.g., Olaparib, Niraparib), used for ovarian, breast, and prostate cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. These drugs aim to damage DNA precisely in cancer cells without harming normal cells, thereby minimizing side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Another type of drug being tested is radiopharmaceuticals, which emit radiation to cause DNA breaks specifically in tumor cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Dr. Magdalena Kordon shares a personal testament to the efficacy of these treatments, stating her mother is alive and disease-free after three years thanks to such therapies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Ethical Considerations

Despite the technological advancements, significant challenges remain, particularly concerning the [[ethical_and_evolutionary_implications_of_human_genome_modification | ethical and evolutionary implications of human genome modification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>:
-   **Evolutionary Impact**: It is difficult to assess the long-term evolutionary consequences of large-scale interference with the human genome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. There are concerns about how such modifications will affect future generations and the further development of the human species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
-   **Defining Humanity**: A Polish writer, Jacek Dukaj, predicts that future generations might be so genetically modified that they could no longer be called *Homo sapiens* in the traditional sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
-   **Embryo Modification**: The ability to modify [[human_embryo_research_and_development | human embryo]] DNA in the mother's womb to cure diseases like Down Syndrome is a complex issue, deemed "not that simple" due to ethical and safety concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## The Role of Dr. Magdalena Kordon and IntoDNA

Dr. Magdalena Kordon, a biophysicist from Jagiellonian University and co-founder of the startup "intoDNA," is a key figure in this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Her doctorate focused on understanding how human cells protect DNA by maintaining its stability and security, specifically investigating single-strand DNA breaks and the protein XRCC1 involved in their repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

Cells have developed a set of tools to prevent DNA damage and quickly repair it when it occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. DNA is constantly exposed to external and internal factors that can cause it to break or become damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. Damage can include single- and double-stranded breaks, errors in the genetic code, or attached structures that impair DNA function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Dr. Kordon's doctoral research revealed that the XRCC1 protein is delivered to the site of a single-strand break like a "tanker," parking a "set of tools" at full readiness to deliver molecules needed for repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

The startup "intoDNA" develops and applies the "stright technological platform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Born out of research at Jagiellonian University, this platform addresses the previous lack of [[technologies_for_detecting_and_repairing_dna_damage | technology for detecting DNA damage]] directly at a low level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Their technology allows for:
-   Precise definition and counting of mechanical DNA damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
-   Localization of damages and determining their quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
-   Assessing if a patient will respond to a specific type of [[the_potential_future_of_personalized_medicine_and_targeted_therapies | targeted therapy]] or if treatment needs to be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

IntoDNA's primary goal is not to develop therapies directly but to assist companies and laboratories worldwide in developing new generation [[the_potential_future_of_personalized_medicine_and_targeted_therapies | targeted therapies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Their focus is mainly on oncology, but also extends to neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Huntington's disease) and other areas where DNA damage or stability is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## The Future of Medicine and Humanity

The ability to modify human DNA opens up possibilities for the future of medicine and humanity:

### Personalized Medicine
The speaker believes the "only right direction" for oncological therapies is [[the_potential_future_of_personalized_medicine_and_targeted_therapies | personalized medicine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This involves:
-   Very accurate diagnostics of the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
-   Characterization of a specific tumor, including genetic and functional testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
-   Tailoring therapy to the needs of a specific individual patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
-   [[the_role_of_genetic_engineering | Genome editing]] therapies could be one solution within this personalized approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Curing Cancer
While a single "cure for cancer" does not exist due to the unique nature of each tumor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, there is strong belief that cancer will cease to be a fatal disease in many cases through [[the_potential_future_of_personalized_medicine_and_targeted_therapies | advanced personalized therapies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

### Extending Lifespan
There is a strong possibility that through [[genetic_modification_and_the_future_of_humanity | modifications of DNA]], humans may eventually exceed the age of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Historically, continuous improvements in quality of life and treatment effectiveness have led to a steady increase in average human survival rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. While DNA largely determines species lifespan, individual predisposition to diseases is also written in the genome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. The stability of DNA strands and the effectiveness of repair mechanisms decrease with age, but lifestyle choices can mitigate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

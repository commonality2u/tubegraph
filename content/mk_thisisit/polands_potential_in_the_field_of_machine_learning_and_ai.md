Professor Artur Dubrawski, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science Department—considered among the best in the world—discusses Poland's significant opportunities and human capital in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Historical Roots and Polish Contributions

The field of artificial intelligence began with mathematical logic, aiming to automate theorem proving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Machine learning, specifically, is a domain where [[creating_innovation_and_intellectual_property_in_Poland | Poland]] has a strong historical link.

Professor Dubrawski notes that Carnegie Mellon University has a Nobel Prize winner, Professor Simon, who was one of the co-creators of the mathematical methods of intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Furthermore, he identifies three founders of the field of machine learning:
*   Tom Mitel, a professor at CMU who founded the world's first machine learning department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Mitel also has admitted to Polish roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   Carbel, from Uruguay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   Ryszard Michalski, a professor from [[polands_development_in_the_scientific_community | Poland]] who worked for many years in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

If one "very carefully" estimates Polishness, approximately half of the "batch" of talent involved in founding machine learning can be considered Polish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

### Polish Mathematical Legacy
The Monte Carlo method, a fundamental concept in computing and simulation, was invented by a Polish mathematician from Lviv, Stanisław Ulam, who later worked on the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. Ulam was a member of the legendary Lviv school of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:05]</a>.

## Poland's Human Potential in AI and ML

Poland possesses great human potential in the field of AI, with individuals who are very well educated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:24:00">[29:24:00]</a>.

### Success in Competitions
[[Polands_Success_in_International_Programming_Competitions | Poland]] consistently performs well in international computer science competitions:
*   In the ICPC (International Computer Science Olympiad), Poland's performance is often superior to Harvard's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:11:00">[30:11:00]</a>.
*   Polish students from the University of Warsaw's Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science have won many computer competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>.

This strong performance indicates a significant existing talent pool that needs to be leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00:00">[32:00:00]</a>.

## Poland's Strategic Opportunity

Professor Dubrawski emphasizes that the field of machine learning and AI does not require large capital and financial investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:05:00">[32:05:00]</a>.

> "Honestly, all you need is a couple of computers and something in your head and you can enter the position of a leader." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:10:00">[32:10:00]</a>

Looking at the state of science in this field in Western Europe, now is the opportune moment for [[economic_potential_and_aspirations_for_Poland | Poland]] to become a leader.

> "This is the moment when Poland should jump not as the last wagon of this European train but as the locomotive of this train with artificial intelligence indicate directions." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:28:00">[32:28:00]</a>

Professor Dubrawski identifies an "exceptional" window of opportunity for Poland that will last for a few years, which must be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:00">[33:17:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Overcoming Defeatism

Despite the immense potential, a significant obstacle is the "defeatist attitude" prevalent among many in [[challenges_and_potential_in_polish_science_and_technology | Poland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:47:00">[32:47:00]</a>. This perspective, characterized by skepticism about Poland's ability to succeed or retain talent, needs to be changed by 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:52:00">[32:52:00]</a>.

## Vision for the Future

Professor Dubrawski, an "incurable patriot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:00">[33:51:00]</a>, is committed to popularizing the dream of Poland becoming number one in Europe in AI, or at least a European leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:58:00">[33:58:00]</a>. He appeals to all those who wish to participate to engage actively in this endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:24:00">[33:24:00]</a>.

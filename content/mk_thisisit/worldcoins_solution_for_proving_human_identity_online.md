## The Problem of Online Identity
Estimates suggest that up to half of all internet activity comes from bots, leading to damage from disinformation and misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It has become increasingly difficult to distinguish humans from bots online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The ability to distinguish humans from bots while maintaining privacy is seen as crucial to prevent the internet from ceasing to function effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Worldcoin was created to address this growing need for infrastructure that will help humanity thrive in a new era of powerful tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

As AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) becomes more common in the future, it will be impossible to distinguish a real human from an artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Worldcoin's founders believe that if a solution isn't built quickly, the internet will stop working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## World ID: The Digital Passport
Worldcoin aims to solve the problem by developing a protocol that allows individuals to prove they are a unique human being during online interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This solution enables people to prove their [[concept_of_humanity_and_technological_entities | humanity]] through online interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

World ID functions as a digital passport on a phone that proves an individual is a unique human and not a bot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This digital passport is used globally to build a fast-growing network free from fraud, where every participant is a verified human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## The ORB Device: Verifying Humanity
World ID verification is conducted using an "ORB" device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Development and Design
The ORB is a highly sophisticated device designed by physicists in Germany and manufactured there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. It is designed to be tamper-proof and capable of handling sensitive data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The first prototypes were developed in a workshop in Germany, which now serves as a repair and refurbishment center for ORB equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

From an engineering standpoint, a shape that is easily and efficiently manufactured is preferable, but from a designer's perspective, an attractive, recognizable, and less intimidating shape is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Industrial designer Thomas Mayerhofer helped design elements such as the angle of the ring, which is set at the same angle as the Earth's rotation (like the equator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The spherical shape was chosen to be more familiar and accessible, rather than a box with sharp edges which might be intimidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The sphere also serves as a metaphor for the Earth, reflecting the project's global nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

The ORB was designed with an open-source model, aiming for decentralization, meaning disassembly should not require expensive tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Key components include cosmetic housings, an optical module (the "heart" of the device responsible for its operation), a structural ring, body, cooling system, and electronics (PCBA modules, motherboard, protective board) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Iris Scanning Technology
The most challenging task in [[development_and_technology_behind_worldcoins_orb_device | ORB development]] was verifying the iris and getting a good enough image for over 8 billion people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The entire optical module consists of many special sensors and optical paths to ensure reliable operation every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

Iris entropy is very high, meaning there are many differences between individual irises, making them suitable for identity checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. After studying various biometric solutions like fingerprints, face scans, and DNA, the iris was deemed the most effective on a scale of a billion users, particularly in terms of susceptibility to abuse and adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The iris is currently the least susceptible to fraud and stands the test of time as it does not change much with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Unlike typical phone-based face ID (one-to-one comparison), World ID requires comparing one person against all others (one-to-many relationship) to ensure uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Research indicates that only hand veins or the eye are suitable for distinguishing billions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Iris scanning was chosen because it is already widely used by governments (e.g., India's Aadhaar project with 1.2 billion users) and at many airports, providing a paved technological path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Future computing platforms like AR and VR will likely use eyes as a gateway to the digital world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## [[privacy_and_data_handling_in_digital_identity_systems | Privacy and Data Handling]]
The ORB device is designed to secure privacy by not storing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. While complex cryptographic concepts like multiparty computations and Merkle trees are involved, the simple explanation is that the device knows nothing about the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Worldcoin, as an organization, does not store user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

When an ORB scans a user's face and iris, the data is processed on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. The ORB verifies if the user is a unique physical person, and the only information transmitted to Worldcoin is the "iris code" â€“ a unique binary code representing the user's iris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Photos and images are deleted from the ORB and never kept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. An encrypted copy of the iris code is sent to the user's device, making them the sole possessor of their data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

Worldcoin aims to educate users globally about its processes and address concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Different regions have different priorities; for example, Argentina is highly receptive to Web3 and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, while Japan and Korea prioritize data control and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. There is a recognized difference in approach to privacy between Americans and Europeans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. This tension is seen as beneficial, leading to a middle ground where data isn't entirely sold or hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Worldcoin plans to continue expanding in Europe, including Austria, Poland, Hungary, and Romania, and actively cooperates with data protection authorities to understand and adhere to laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. The key is to avoid lowering security levels to continue service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

## Evolution of the Project
The company name was changed from Worldcoin to World <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. While "Worldcoin" continues to operate, the name had both positive and negative connotations and did not fully convey that the project is an ambitious technology company solving important problems beyond just cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. The name change better reflects the evolution of the network, which has grown into a system with many interconnected elements centered around real human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

The project involves World ID for identifying true [[concept_of_humanity_and_technological_entities | humanity]] on the internet and distinguishing people from bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. It includes an application, a blockchain (World Chain), and a full system where elements cooperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

Unlike many Web3 projects that revolve solely around coins, Worldcoin's key element is proof of personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. The coin received upon joining grants users two things: the right to vote in the protocol (influencing future decisions) and equity in the project, which supports its global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

## Futuristic Vision and Reception
The combination of biometrics, cryptocurrencies, and a thesis about a seemingly distant future (like the ORB device) can make the project appear very futuristic and controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. While the project is not viewed as controversial by its creators, they understand that public perception is influenced by past experiences with cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. They encourage cynicism and critical questions from the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

Founders Sam Altman and Alex Blania are described as visionary individuals who see "what is around the bend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. They are driven by a desire to improve and influence the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. The project is rooted in the belief that it is a good idea important for the world, with no "plan B" for its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

Mathematics is widely considered to be full of beauty and elegance, a concept comparable to the concise and profound nature of Japanese Haiku poetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Just as Haiku is characterized by its concise form, deep content, and aesthetic beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, similar qualities are found in mathematical expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Elegance in Scientific Formulas
Examples of such elegant "haikus" in science include:
*   [[Physics and mathematics their interplay and implications | Einstein's E=mc²]], known for its concise form, deep content, and undeniable elegance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   The Schrödinger equation, which describes the evolution of a particle in quantum physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Boltzmann's entropy formula, representing the second law of thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   [[Geometry and spacetime | Einstein's field equations]], which describe the [[Geometry and spacetime | geometry of spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

These formulas, much like Haiku, embody a profound meaning within a simple structure, highlighting the [[elegance_and_beauty_in_mathematics | elegance and beauty in mathematics]] and its [[role_of_mathematics_in_understanding_the_universe | role in understanding the universe]].

## Euler's Formula: The Quintessence of Mathematical Elegance
Euler's formula ($e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$) is often regarded as the most elegant and beautiful formula in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Its significance stems from its ability to combine five fundamental mathematical constants: 0, 1, Pi ($\pi$), the imaginary unit ($i$), and Euler's number ($e$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. These constants originate from diverse areas of mathematics, including trigonometry ($\pi$), complex numbers ($i$), and mathematical analysis/differential calculus ($e$), yet they converge harmoniously within this single equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Interpreting Geometric Principles through Coordinates

### The Pythagorean Identity and the Unit Circle
The trigonometric identity $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$ is a foundational example of a mathematical "haiku" that can be understood geometrically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Its essence is derived directly from the Pythagorean theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

Consider a right-angled triangle where the hypotenuse has a length of 1. If the two legs have lengths of $\cos(x)$ and $\sin(x)$, then by the Pythagorean theorem, $(\cos(x))^2 + (\sin(x))^2 = 1^2$, simplifying to $\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x) = 1$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This means the distance from one end of the hypotenuse to the other is exactly 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

The introduction of a coordinate system, a fundamental discovery by Descartes, allows for a deeper geometric interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. If one end of the hypotenuse is placed at the origin (0,0) of the coordinate system, the other end must lie on a circle with a radius of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The coordinates of any point on this unit circle are precisely $(\cos(x), \sin(x))$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Thus, the identity $\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x) = 1$ directly describes a circle with a radius of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

In this context, 'x' represents the length of the arc along the unit circle, starting from the positive x-axis and extending to the point $(\cos(x), \sin(x))$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. For example, a quarter of the circle has an arc length of $\pi/2$, leading to coordinates $(0,1)$ which are $(\cos(\pi/2), \sin(\pi/2))$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Half the circle has an arc length of $\pi$, corresponding to coordinates $(-1,0)$ or $(\cos(\pi), \sin(\pi))$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This property is used to define the number $\pi$ formally in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Operations on Points in a Coordinate System
The coordinate system enables operations on points in a plane that were not obvious to ancient Greek mathematicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>:

*   **Addition of Points:** Points (a,b) and (c,d) can be added by summing their corresponding coordinates: $(a+c, b+d)$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Geometrically, this corresponds to vector addition, where the sum of two vectors is the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

*   **Multiplication of Points (Complex Numbers):** To multiply points, a new notation is introduced where a point $(a,b)$ is written as $a + ib$, replacing the comma with a plus sign and 'b' with $ib$ (where 'i' is a new symbol) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. When multiplying $(a + ib)(c + id)$, the product involves an $i^2$ term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. To define multiplication meaningfully, the value $i^2 = -1$ is assigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This is the definition of the imaginary unit 'i', which allows for the multiplication of complex numbers, effectively enabling the multiplication of points on a plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## Exponential Function and its Relation to Trigonometry

The exponential function, $e^x$, is fundamentally defined by the property that its derivative is equal to itself ($d/dx(e^x) = e^x$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This function can be expressed as an infinite series: $e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \dots$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Taking the derivative of this series term by term results in the original series, confirming its defining property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

Similarly, sine and cosine functions also have derivative properties: $d/dx(\sin(x)) = \cos(x)$ and $d/dx(\cos(x)) = -\sin(x)$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. These functions can also be expressed as infinite series:
*   $\sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \dots$ (contains only odd terms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>
*   $\cos(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \dots$ (contains only even terms, with alternating signs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>

Euler's profound discovery was the connection between these seemingly disparate series: $e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. By substituting $ix$ into the series for $e^x$ and using the property $i^2 = -1$, $i^3 = -i$, $i^4 = 1$, etc., the terms naturally separate into the series for cosine (even powers of $ix$) and sine (odd powers of $ix$), with the correct alternating signs provided by powers of $i$.

When $x = \pi$, Euler's formula becomes:
$e^{i\pi} = \cos(\pi) + i\sin(\pi)$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>
Since $\cos(\pi) = -1$ and $\sin(\pi) = 0$, this simplifies to:
$e^{i\pi} = -1 + i(0)$
$e^{i\pi} = -1$
Which can be rearranged to $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

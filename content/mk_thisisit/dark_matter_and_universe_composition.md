The universe's composition is largely misunderstood by common perception. While it might seem that the universe is primarily made of atoms, this is not true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Most of the universe is, in fact, [[dark_matter_and_potential_new_particle | dark]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Dark Matter
[[dark_matter_and_potential_new_particle | Dark matter]] is a new substance that does not consist of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. It is believed to constitute the majority of matter in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This substance can be studied using telescopes and other instruments, indicating it is not merely science fiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### String Theory and Dark Matter
String theory proposes that [[dark_matter_and_potential_new_particle | dark matter]] is created by "notes higher than electrons and protons" in its "music" of vibrating strings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. In this view, [[dark_matter_and_potential_new_particle | dark matter]] represents another "octave of the string" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. String theory is currently the only theory developed enough to explain not only fundamental particles like neutrons and protons, but also [[dark_matter_and_potential_new_particle | dark matter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Dark Matter as Evidence for the Multiverse
The existence of [[dark_matter_and_potential_new_particle | dark matter]] could provide concrete proof for the multiverse theory, which posits an infinite number of universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The number of universes and forms of matter are considered infinite, with [[dark_matter_and_potential_new_particle | dark matter]] being one such form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Ryan Poźniak Daniels, a 22-year-old developer, has been working on [[Augmented Reality and Apple Vision Pro | augmented reality]] (AR) and virtual reality (VR) for almost 10 years, starting to build apps in AR at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>. His journey into AR began after interviewing Shigeru Miyamoto of Nintendo, who predicted that the future of games and technology belonged to virtual and [[Augmented Reality and Apple Vision Pro | augmented reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:25">[20:25:25]</a>. This revelation prompted Daniels to specialize in these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:50">[20:50:50]</a>. He believes AR will save humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a> and help people remain relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

## Work with Apple Vision Pro

Apple invited Daniels to be one of the first app developers to build new applications for the new [[Augmented Reality and Apple Vision Pro | augmented reality]] glasses, the [[Augmented Reality and Apple Vision Pro | Apple Vision Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:49">[03:49:49]</a>. He is currently focused on creating these new applications, which will become available in a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:15:15">[28:15:15]</a>.

The [[Augmented Reality and Apple Vision Pro | Apple Vision Pro]] is described as a special device that no other VR glasses can emulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:55">[04:55:55]</a>. Key features for application development include:
*   **High Resolution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   **Control Methods:** Users can control the device with their eyes, voice, and hand movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:20">[04:20:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:03">[05:03:03]</a>.
*   **[[Artificial Intelligence Integration in Augmented Reality | Built-in AI]]:** The device includes [[Artificial Intelligence Integration in Augmented Reality | AI]] that understands user intent within the AR/VR structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>.
*   **Spatial Computing:** Apple refers to their AR approach as "spatial computing," which means the technology connects with the space around the user, allowing for easy placement of virtual objects in a real environment for visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:50">[09:50:50]</a>.

## [[Artificial Intelligence Integration in Augmented Reality | Role of AI in AR Development]]

Daniels emphasizes that [[Augmented Reality and Apple Vision Pro | augmented reality]] truly needs [[Artificial Intelligence Integration in Augmented Reality | AI]] and machine learning to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:44">[05:44:44]</a>. [[Augmented Reality and Apple Vision Pro | AR]] uses a field called computer vision, which is based on [[Artificial Intelligence Integration in Augmented Reality | AI]], meaning AR cannot work without [[Artificial Intelligence Integration in Augmented Reality | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:56">[05:56:56]</a>. He sees [[Artificial Intelligence Integration in Augmented Reality | AI]] as the foundation of AR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:06">[06:06:06]</a>.

While [[Artificial Intelligence Integration in Augmented Reality | AI]] is excellent at solving problems and can even replace human work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:43">[10:43:43]</a>, Daniels believes [[Augmented Reality and Apple Vision Pro | augmented reality]] will save humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:23">[06:23:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:10">[26:10:10]</a>. He argues that AR allows people to remain important and active participants in the world, even if [[Artificial Intelligence Integration in Augmented Reality | super intelligence]] is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:36">[25:36:36]</a>.

## Notable Projects and [[future_implications_and_applications_of_AI_technology | Applications of AR]]

Daniels has been involved in several high-profile projects demonstrating the diverse [[future_implications_and_applications_of_AI_technology | applications of AR]]:

### NASA Astronaut Suits
At 22 years old, Daniels led a research team that participated in a NASA competition to invent a new [[Augmented Reality and Apple Vision Pro | augmented reality]] application interface for use on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:45">[11:45:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:53">[13:53:53]</a>. His team was accepted by NASA to create and cooperate on these AR glasses and a special interface for astronauts to use while walking on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:21">[12:21:21]</a>. This application will be in their helmets, allowing them to check vital parameters like oxygen levels and determine proper direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:44">[12:44:44]</a>.

### SpaceX Educational VR
Daniels also cooperates with SpaceX, developing a virtual reality application to educate people on what it's like to be an astronaut, the colonization of other planets, and visits to the space station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:51">[14:51:51]</a>. This VR experience allows users to practically experience being an astronaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:13">[15:13:13]</a>. He views this ability to "magically move into space" using VR glasses as akin to magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:28">[15:28:28]</a>.

### Snapchat Filters
Five years ago, at age 17, Daniels was invited by Snapchat to create one of the first [[Augmented Reality and Apple Vision Pro | augmented reality]] filters for their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:11">[16:11:11]</a>. He was among the first programmers to receive access to the tools needed to create new Snapchat filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:39">[16:39:39]</a>. He designed an AR experience that transforms the user into an astronaut, complete with a helmet, and a rocket shooting out if they open their mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:51">[16:51:51]</a>.

### [[educational_needs_for_adapting_to_ai_advancements | Stanford Educational Tools]]
Stanford University invited Daniels to co-create one of the first interactive [[educational_needs_for_adapting_to_ai_advancements | educational tools]] designed to teach neurosurgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:11">[09:11:11]</a>.

### Music and AR
Daniels combines his passion for music with VR technology, creating musical experiences that transport the listener to new dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:47">[17:47:47]</a>. He had the opportunity to work with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, creating original music for their concerts, often adapting and rearranging classical pieces like Chopin's preludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:06">[18:06:06]</a>. His projects involved incorporating Polish folklore and culture into both his animations and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:02">[27:02:02]</a>.

## The Future of [[Augmented Reality and Apple Vision Pro | AR/VR]]
Daniels believes that while few people currently use AR or VR daily, much will change thanks to Apple and new headsets appearing in the next few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:42">[06:42:42]</a>. He foresees a day when everyone will wear and use AR and VR glasses, becoming a new way of communication, entertainment, learning, and [[educational_needs_for_adapting_to_ai_advancements | education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. He predicts that AR/VR glasses will eventually replace the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:02">[22:02:02]</a>, much like mobile phones became ubiquitous after a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:49">[21:49:49]</a>. He also expects these technologies to reach all corners of the world, just like mobile phones have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:42">[22:42:42]</a>.

Daniels views [[Augmented Reality and Apple Vision Pro | augmented reality]] and [[Artificial Intelligence Integration in Augmented Reality | artificial intelligence]] as pioneering technologies that feel a bit like magic to people, similar to how Edison's electric light bulb was perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:17">[24:17:17]</a>. His personal mission is to democratize AR and VR for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:04">[25:04:04]</a>.

## Polish Heritage and Influence
Despite being born in the United States, Daniels speaks Polish, loves Polish culture, and considers himself Polish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a>. He received the title of "Outstanding Pole," an honor recognizing his various projects that incorporate Polish culture and folklore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:31">[26:31:31]</a>. He draws inspiration from Polish masters like Andrzej Sapkowski and Stanisław Lem for creating new VR applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:40">[29:40:40]</a>. He is proud of his Polish roots and consistently tries to expose and celebrate them in his journalistic work, virtual reality, music, animations, and games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40:40">[27:40:40]</a>. He believes Poland has many talented people working on the future of gaming technology and innovation, which he finds uplifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:55:55">[29:55:55]</a>.

## Wormholes and Spacetime Tunnels
The idea of [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | wormholes]], also known as the [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | Einstein-Rosen Bridge]], originated from the work of Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen in the mid-1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. This concept is a property of [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | spacetime]], first discovered by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

A formal mathematical solution suggests that if eternal [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] and an eternal universe exist (meaning a [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] that has always been present), then this solution includes a [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]], a white hole, and a [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | space-time tunnel]] connecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. However, this specific type of [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | wormhole]] is not traversable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

To construct a stable [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | wormhole]] through which travel would be possible, forms of energy or matter are required that are not currently known to exist in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. While theoretically such [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | wormholes]] might exist, it is generally believed that nature does not produce stable, traversable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. This remains an unproven area of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

## The Information Paradox
The [[black_holes_and_information_paradox | information paradox]] is a significant [[paradoxes_in_science | paradox]] in modern physics, primarily associated with the work of Stephen Hawking on [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

### The Premise: Information Preservation
In theoretical physics, all laws of nature suggest that information is preserved and cannot be destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. For example, if a book is burned, all emitted light, heat, atoms, photons, and smoke particles can theoretically be perfectly measured, and in principle, the book could be rebuilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. While practically impossible, it is theoretically achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

### The Paradox with Black Holes
The question raised by Hawking's work is whether this principle of information preservation also applies to [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. If a book is thrown into a [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]], is the information about that book recorded or returned to the universe before the [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] eventually evaporates due to Hawking radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>?

Hawking's initial calculations indicated that this information would *not* be contained in the radiation, implying that what enters a [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] is not only completely mixed but also erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. This contradicts the fundamental principle of information preservation.

### Current Understanding
Hundreds of thousands of physicists have worked on this problem over the last 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. The current prevailing opinion is that information *does* come out again, albeit in a very mixed way, recorded in the radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. This suggests that there was an error in Hawking's initial calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

### The Role of Spacetime and Quantum Gravity
[[black_holes_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Black holes]] are described in [[black_holes_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's theory]] as pure [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | spacetime]] geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. Hawking radiation originates from the [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole's]] event horizon, essentially being "torn out" of the vacuum of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. The challenge is understanding how information about what fell into the [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] is eventually recorded in this radiation that comes from the vacuum and the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

Some speculative interpretations suggest the existence of a type of [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | space-time tunnel]], different from [[wormholes_and_spacetime_tunnels | Einstein's bridges]], that opens from the inside of the [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black hole]] to the outside, allowing information to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. This is a very speculative area of research, based on complex mathematics without direct evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

The ongoing research into [[black_holes_and_information_paradox | black holes]] and the [[information_paradox_and_singularities_in_black_holes | information paradox]] is providing fleeting insights into a deeper theory of [[concept_of_spacetime_and_wormholes | space-time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. This pursuit of understanding how [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] behave, particularly regarding quantum information and quantum entanglement, is leading to a significant leap in our understanding of quantum theory and how reality operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

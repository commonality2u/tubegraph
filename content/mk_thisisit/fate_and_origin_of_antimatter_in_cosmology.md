## The Antimatter Problem

One of the most significant challenges in cosmology is explaining the observed abundance of matter and the apparent lack of antimatter in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. The standard theory of elementary particles, also known as the Standard Model, does not fully account for this imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## Origin and Imbalance

It is theorized that immediately following the Big Bang, an equal amount of matter and antimatter should have been created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. However, certain processes must have occurred, leading to a slight excess of matter over antimatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. The precise nature of these processes remains unknown, even though experimental evidence suggests that equal amounts should exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Annihilation and Remnants

The excess matter then annihilated all the antimatter, a process which generated a vast number of photons, or light particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This annihilation explains why photons are significantly more abundant than other particles of normal matter in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. The small residue of matter that remained after this annihilation constitutes all the matter we observe today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

Antimatter does not contribute to the expansion of the universe; rather, it is matter that causes this expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, a principle derived from Friedman's equations, which are [[Albert Einstein | Einstein]]'s cosmic equations of general relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

## Quantum Production of Particles

New matter can be generated through the quantum production of particle-antiparticle pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. In extremely hot and dense conditions, such as those found during matter collapse, a significant amount of new matter can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. This phenomenon, where gravity, movement, and quantum theory interact to create new particles, is analogous to Hawking radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

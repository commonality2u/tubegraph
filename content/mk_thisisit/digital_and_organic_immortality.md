The concept of [[immortality_and_aging_of_human_cells | immortality]] can be divided into two main categories: digital and organic, each presenting unique challenges and possibilities for the future of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## Digital Immortality

[[Digital transformation and its implications | Digital immortality]] is the ability to preserve an individual's identity, memories, and thought patterns in a non-biological format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. This form of immortality is considered achievable today, albeit in primitive forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### Current Capabilities

The first generation of digitally immortal people already exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This is currently achieved by creating an image of a person that can move, speak, and engage in conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

An example of this is William Shatner, known from *Star Trek*, who underwent a multi-day process to record his entire biography, life ideas, thoughts, and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This recording was then linked to his digital image, creating a version of him that can "live forever" and interact with others, enabling future generations to converse with him about life in the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

This technology allows for the preservation of a person's thoughts indefinitely, maintaining privacy as secrets can be kept within the recording unless intentionally shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

### Future of Digital Immortality

Within 100 to 1000 years, it may be possible to transfer the human brain to a computer or a computer to the brain, effectively making both one entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

The concept of digitizing the human brain, which contains 100 billion neurons (compared to 100,000 in an insect brain that has already been digitized), is seen as "only a matter of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. This process is likened to "reverse engineering the brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

In the distant future, digital selves could be saved as software, placed in rockets, and launched into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Upon landing on a celestial body, this software could connect to and control an exoskeleton, allowing for the exploration of the universe by sending one's consciousness on a journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

## Organic Immortality

Organic immortality, which allows the physical body to live forever, is considered much more difficult to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Proposed Solutions

One proposed solution involves replacing used organs with new ones, thereby maintaining the physical body indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

## Convergence of Immortality and Technology

The future envisions a convergence of human biology and advanced technology, impacting both digital and organic immortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Brain-Computer Interfaces and Quantum Computing

The human brain, once considered a "black box," is now understood to have mechanical analogies and potentially quantum properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. [[Future of artificial intelligence | Quantum computers]], which already exist and operate in a world of infinite states, are millions of times more powerful than today's digital computers and could someday work similarly to a quantum brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

Current progress allows for the connection of the human brain to a laptop, enabling paralyzed individuals to control movements and perform activities considered human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. This has been demonstrated at events like the Olympic Games, where a paralyzed man, using a digital skeleton connected to his brain, was able to walk and open the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

### Human Modification and Space Colonization

The ability to modify the human genome, not just one gene at a time, but the entire genome, could allow for radical changes to human biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Instead of solely curing diseases, this could enable humanity to change itself to populate the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

Instead of adapting planets like Mars to human needs, future humans might [[genetic_modification_and_the_future_of_humanity | modify themselves]] to survive in diverse and hostile environments throughout the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This could lead to the creation of "superhumans" with abilities beyond robots, capable of colonizing Mars and subsequently the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

The ability to control a robot or exoskeleton via consciousness could allow for colonization of the universe at speeds approaching that of light, adhering to the laws of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. This implies a future where humanity could become "mythical gods" with the ability to manipulate matter, energy, and life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Consciousness and [[concept_of_humanity_and_technological_entities | Conscious Machines]]

While there is no universally accepted definition of [[The convergence of AI and human biology | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>, it is believed possible to create a machine that is aware of its location, understands its position in the universe, and can interact with humans and other beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

This implies a future where [[synthetic_humans_and_artificial_materials | technological entities]] might exhibit what we perceive as consciousness, blurring the lines between natural and artificial existence.

Nikodem Popławski's research delves into the fundamental issues of the universe's functioning, offering alternative perspectives on established theories, particularly regarding [[Inflationary Theory and Alternatives|inflation theory]] and the role of quantum phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Popławski's Stance on Quantum Gravity and Classical Space-time

Popławski believes that there will be no [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity|quantum theory of gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He asserts that space-time is fundamentally classical, and there are no gravitons acting as carriers of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Instead, the curvature of space-time itself is gravity, a fundamental phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Matter within this classical space-time is quantized and interacts through quantum interactions via electromagnetism, weak, and strong forces (electroweak and strong interactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. He argues that creating a classical theory from [[Quantum theory at atomic and molecular levels|quantum theory]] through averaging out gravitons to create a classical theory from quantum theory is unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Contrasting Views: Roger Penrose
Sir Roger Penrose, while a supporter of gravity's influence on quantum mechanics, suggested that gravity causes the collapse of the wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. In Penrose's model, the wave function is curved by space-time, and stronger gravity leads to a faster collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This explains phenomena like Schrödinger's cat, where the superposition of states (dead and alive) exists for an extremely short time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### The Double Slit Experiment and [[Quantum Mechanics and de Broglie-Bohm theory|De Broglie-Bohm Theory]]
Popławski supports [[Quantum mechanics and de Broglie-Bohm theory|De Broglie-Bohm's theory]], also known as the pilot wave hypothesis of [[Quantum Mechanics and its implications|quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This theory posits that the wave function is a real entity, a solution to the Dirac or Schrödinger equations, and particles are distinct entities that ride on these "imaginary" quantum waves like surfers on ocean waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. In this interpretation, each particle exists at only one point at a time, eliminating the need for a wave function collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

The De Broglie-Bohm hypothesis explains the interference patterns observed in the double-slit experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The wave function dictates how particles move, and tiny, unmeasurable errors in initial conditions can lead to chaotic, unpredictable final positions on the interference fringes, making [[Chaos Theory and Its Relation to Quantum Physics|quantum mechanics]] probabilistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Black Holes, New Universes, and the Big Bounce

Popławski's most significant scientific achievement revolves around his theory that every black hole creates a new universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This idea was recognized as one of the 10 most important theories of the year by National Geographic and Science magazine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Morgan Freeman even called him the "second Copernicus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### The Mechanism of Universe Creation
Popławski's mechanism for new universe creation involves the twisting of space-time, which removes singularities within black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This twisting, or torsion, is an additional aspect of space-time beyond the curvature assumed by Einstein, which Einstein assumed to be zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. While negligible at normal densities (e.g., on Earth, in stars, or even neutron stars), torsion becomes very strong at extremely high densities, such as those near singularities or the Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. At these densities, torsion acts as a repulsive gravitational force, preventing the formation of a singularity and leading to a "big bounce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

Instead of collapsing into a singularity, matter stops and bounces, then expands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. Since this expanded matter cannot escape the black hole's event horizon, it forms a new universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

### Quantum Particle Production and Cosmic Expansion
The mass for this new universe comes from the quantum production of particle-antiparticle pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. In the hot, dense state of collapsing matter, a significant amount of new matter is created through this process, analogous to Hawking radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. This leads to a larger amount of matter than initially present in the black hole, causing the new cosmos to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

Popławski's model suggests that the universe born from a black hole doesn't necessarily expand indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Friedman equations indicate that if not too much matter is created, the cosmos will expand and then contract for another bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Each bounce creates more matter, leading to progressively larger cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Eventually, after several bounces, the universe could become so large that the cosmological constant (dark energy), which is proportional to the universe's volume, dominates, causing the universe to expand infinitely rather than returning for another cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Explaining Cosmic Inflation Naturally

Popławski's research (published in 2016 and 2021 in the Astrophysical Journal) demonstrates that combining the twisting of space-time, the big bounce, and the quantum production of particle-antiparticle pairs naturally leads to [[Inflationary Theory and Alternatives|inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

### Challenges with Conventional Inflation Theory
The conventional [[Inflationary Theory and Alternatives|inflation theory]], developed by Alan Guth and Andrei Linde, addresses several cosmic problems such as the horizon problem, flatness problem, and the origin of structure (distribution of galaxies and voids) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. It attributes these to an exponential expansion of the early universe, where microscopic quantum fluctuations were blown up to large scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. While satellite measurements (like the Planck satellite's microwave background radiation) seem to confirm quantities consistent with [[Inflationary Theory and Alternatives|inflation theory]], the origin of inflation remains a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

Traditional [[Inflationary Theory and Alternatives|inflation theory]] typically invokes hypothetical scalar fields (inflatons) and requires two arbitrary parameters to describe inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. A major criticism is that this inflation can theoretically last forever, which contradicts the observed universe, as infinite expansion would prevent star formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

### Popławski's Model of Natural Inflation
Popławski's model offers a natural explanation for [[Inflationary Theory and Alternatives|inflation]] without invoking additional hypothetical fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. His approach, relying on the twisting of space-time and the quantum production of particle-antiparticle pairs, only requires one parameter, which could eventually be derived from a larger theory like [[Theory of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity|quantum gravity]] or from concepts like Hawking radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. Crucially, in his model, inflation is not eternal; it lasts for a short period and ends naturally because the effect of the space-time twist diminishes at lower densities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. This provides a more parsimonious and fundamental explanation for the early universe's rapid expansion.

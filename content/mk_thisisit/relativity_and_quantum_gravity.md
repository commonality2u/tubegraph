Twistor theory, developed by Roger Penrose in the 1960s, is one of the most revolutionary theories in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This theory views the structure of space-time in an unusual way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. While traditional understanding considers space-time as a four-dimensional space (three spatial dimensions and one time dimension) where a point is the basic unit, twistor theory posits that the fundamental element of space-time is a ray of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This can be conceptualized as the history of a photon, forming a line in space-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Core Concepts of Twistor Theory

A twistor is more complex than just a light ray; it also accounts for the momentum and angular momentum of the photon, including its rotation (helix and spin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. When a photon has spin, it is not precisely localized, but rather spreads out and twists around itself, giving the theory its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

The initial idea for twistor theory stems from two main concepts explained to Penrose by Engelbert Sching in 1961-1962 at the University of Syracuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Quantum Field Theory and Frequencies
One idea concerned [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum field theory]] and the separation of fields into positive and negative frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This complicated procedure, known as decomposition, involves dividing fields into frequencies and selecting only positive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Conformal Invariance of Maxwell's Equations
The second idea was the conformal invariance of Maxwell's equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. These equations describe electricity, magnetism, and light, and are significant for explaining the phenomenon of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Conformal invariance means that the equations are independent of scale; large and small things are treated equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This concept is particularly useful for describing massless objects like photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## The Role of Complex Numbers
[[Quantum Mechanics and its Implications | Complex numbers]] are fundamental to [[Quantum Mechanics and its Implications | Quantum Mechanics]], as the wave function of any system is described by complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The problem of positive and negative frequencies can be understood using complex numbers, specifically within the complex plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Functions extending to one half of the complex plane represent positive frequencies, and those to the other half represent negative frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## Twistor Theory and Space-Time Geometry
Twistor theory was originally developed to elegantly describe positive and negative frequencies for massless objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. It is particularly adapted to space-time geometry with one dimension of time and three dimensions of space, known as Minkowski signature or pseudo-Riemannian geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. This specific geometry is crucial for [[General relativity and singularities | Einstein's theory of general relativity]], which incorporates gravity by describing a curved Minkowski space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

According to a statement from Columbia University, Penrose's work on twistors is considered "the most important new idea concerning space-time geometry after Einstein" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

## [[Unification of Gravity and Quantum Mechanics | Unification of Gravity and Quantum Theory]]
A significant goal for twistor theory is to [[Unification of Gravity and Quantum Mechanics | unify gravity theory and quantum theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. Professor Maciej Dunajski of the University of Cambridge, a collaborator of Penrose, indicated a breakthrough in twistor theory that could lead to a positive solution for combining these theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

### The Challenge of Gravitons
In [[Quantum Mechanics and Relativity | Quantum Mechanics]], particles like photons have both wave and particle properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>. The idea is that gravity, too, should have a particle form (gravitons) and a wave form (gravitational fields) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. However, gravitons have not yet been directly observed due to the extremely high energies required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

Penrose's work on "nonlinear gravitons" was the first instance where curved twistor theory and curved twistor space were introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. This allows for incorporating the spin of the graviton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. However, a "fundamental confusion" in twistor theory arose because torsion (spin) and frequency mixed, meaning that early developments could only describe left-handed gravitons, not right-handed ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

### Boron Theory and Handedness
To address this, Penrose recently developed the idea of "borons" at a conference in Cambridge, which involves combining the standard twistor theory (inherently left-handed) with the dual twistor theory (right-handed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. This combination is crucial for a proper quantum theory, as both helicities (left-handed and right-handed) are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>.

Weak interactions, as described by Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee (Nobel laureates), are unique among physical theories because they are not left-right symmetric, unlike most of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>. Penrose's work aims to make twistor theory less torsion-dependent, allowing it to describe gravity, which is not a handed theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.

### Quantum Mechanical Coupling
Combining these two "sides" of twistor theory introduces [[Quantum Mechanics and its Implications | Quantum Mechanics]]. It's analogous to position and momentum in [[Quantum Mechanics and its Implications | Quantum Mechanics]], which are canonically coupled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>. In [[Quantum Mechanics and its Implications | Quantum Mechanics]], if a particle's position is well-defined, its momentum is undefined, and vice-versa, a concept fundamental to Heisenberg's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. Similarly, twistors and dual twistors are canonically conjugated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

## Future Implications and Speculation
Penrose believes that the "B-twistor theory," which includes both twistor and dual twistor, could allow for the simultaneous consideration of left-handed and right-handed gravitons and facilitate the inclusion of [[General relativity and singularities | general relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. While this is still speculation, it presents a premise for understanding the quantum aspects of [[General relativity and singularities | general relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

Penrose once discussed his ideas about particle physics with Richard Feynman, who advised him to continue working on twistor theory rather than pursue the particle physics ideas at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>. However, Penrose now believes there is a good chance that particle physics, particularly the strong force, could fit into the B-twistor theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. This connection might involve a "triple product" construction related to quaternions and octonions, which are non-commutative algebraic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>.

While mathematics can be infinitely complicated, physics is interested only in certain aspects of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. The structure of space-time and particle physics, with three spatial and one time dimension, suggests a finite complexity in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>.

Despite individual cellular processes being random, a form of [[determinism vs indeterminism in physics | determinism]] appears to arise within biological systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A key question in biology and physics is understanding how apparent order emerges from this underlying chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Randomness in Cellular Processes

At the cellular level, every process, when observed out of context, appears random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. This includes the random movement of proteins and the random occurrence of biochemical reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. For instance, diffusion, the random movement of molecules inside a cell, is influenced by the surrounding environment, with proteins moving slower in the crowded cellular interior than in pure water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Emergent Determinism

Despite the randomness at the micro-level, the overall behavior of a system, such as an organism speaking coherent words, is not random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This suggests the existence of a principle that adjusts and synchronizes these random processes, leading to deterministic outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Discovering this principle is a significant scientific ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## The Role of Energy

Energy is considered a primary concept in the universe, essential for maintaining systems far from equilibrium in stationary states where time does not significantly alter streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Systems tend to treat energy "like a hot potato," trying to pass it on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This energy exchange governs the structure of systems, as they change to get rid of as much energy as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Therefore, it is energy, not movement, that rules the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Life as Synchronized Biochemical Cycles

Life can be defined as the adjustment of all biochemical cycles to work in harmony, allowing for division and perpetuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. When two systems are connected, new emergent properties appear, but traces of the old ones should also remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. This concept of adjustment and cooperation between chemical molecules, even when competing for resources, is fundamental to how life organizes itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

### Cellular Survival Strategies

*   **Hibernation:** Cells can enter a state similar to hibernation, especially under stress like starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. When deprived of glucose, cells limit ATP consumption and expel water, forming a gel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This gelling stops the movement of molecules like ribosomes, which produce protein and consume a lot of energy, allowing the cell to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This survival strategy is an example of [[molecular_darwinism_and_evolution | natural selection]], where cells that didn't adopt this method did not survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Perfect hibernation would involve stopping the movement of all atoms to allow for indefinite survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Aging and Immortality:** Aging is considered an irreversible process, a "trick of mother nature" to ensure species stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. If individuals were immortal, there would be no need for new generations, potentially leading to an unstable system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   **Cellular "Garbage" Accumulation:** The accumulation of dysfunctional proteins (cellular "garbage") within cells contributes to aging, causing movement to slow down and processes to degrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Some organisms, like *E. coli* bacteria, manage this by segregating garbage to one end during division, so daughter cells are born clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
    *   **Potential for Reversing Aging:** The ability to clean cells of this garbage, or prevent its aggregation, could be a path to reversing the aging process and achieving a form of immortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. There is no known law prohibiting the exchange or purification of cell components to prevent aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Boundaries of Life

Viruses exist at the border of what is considered alive and dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. They do not draw energy on their own, existing in a survival form until they use a host's resources to initiate their mechanisms and copy themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. This behavior is mirrored in computer simulations like "Tierra," where self-replicating programs can develop "viruses" that utilize code fragments from other programs to copy themselves, demonstrating emergent complexity from simple rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

## Broader Implications

Discovering a general principle of synchronization in biological systems could revolutionize medicine, shifting it towards a more holistic approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of organs and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. Instead of treating isolated symptoms, medicine could aim to restore harmonious functioning among various bodily systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

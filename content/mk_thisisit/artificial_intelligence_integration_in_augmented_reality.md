Ryan Po≈∫niak Daniels, a leading app developer, highlights the crucial role of [[integration_of_artificial_intelligence_and_robotics | Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) in the advancement and future of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## The Symbiotic Relationship of AI and AR
Daniels emphasizes that [[augmented_reality_and_apple_vision_pro | Augmented Reality]] fundamentally requires [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | AI]] and machine learning to function effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. He explains that AR relies on a field known as computer vision, which is based on AI, making AI the essential foundation for AR to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Without AI, AR would not operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

While acknowledging that [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | AI]] can solve global issues like climate change, Daniels posits that [[augmented_reality_and_apple_vision_pro | Augmented Reality]] will ultimately save humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. He believes that AR will ensure people remain relevant and important, even with the rise of superintelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. AR expands human perception of reality and can assist with everyday tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### Distinguishing AR/VR from Metaverse
Daniels clarifies that VR is not synonymous with the Metaverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. The Metaverse is a specific application or use case of VR technology, akin to the virtual world depicted in "Ready Player One" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. While the Metaverse allows connection with virtual avatars reflecting real people in a digitally constructed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, Daniels never expected the Metaverse to become a significant part of reality, contrasting it with the perceived impact of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Most people prefer to use AI in reality rather than a virtual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Apple Vision Pro and Spatial Computing
Apple invited Daniels to be one of the first app developers for their new [[augmented_reality_and_apple_vision_pro | augmented reality glasses]], the [[augmented_reality_and_apple_vision_pro | Apple Vision Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Daniels is currently building new applications for this platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

The [[augmented_reality_and_apple_vision_pro | Apple Vision Pro]] is unique because it can be controlled by eye movements, voice, and hand gestures, a capability not found in other headsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. It also features a built-in [[cognitive_abilities_and_ais_interaction_with_humans | AI]] that understands user intent within AR/VR structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

Apple refers to its AR work as "spatial computing" rather than "augmented reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This concept means users interact with technology that connects with their surrounding physical space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, allowing them to easily place virtual objects into their real environment for visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Real-World Applications of AI and AR/VR
Daniels' experience spans several significant projects demonstrating the integration of AI, AR, and VR:

### NASA - Lunar AR Interface
At 22 years old, Daniels led a research team in a NASA competition to invent a new type of [[application_development_for_augmented_reality | augmented reality application interface]] for astronauts on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. His team was accepted by NASA to create a special interface for AR glasses that astronauts will use during future lunar missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This interface will be integrated into astronaut helmets, allowing them to monitor vital parameters like oxygen levels and determine directions for movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Daniels highlights that AI is a crucial method for exploring the moon and other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

This application, experienced through VR glasses, simulates space colonization, visits to space stations, and the overall experience of being an astronaut, helping people explore space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### Snapchat - AR Filters
At 17, Daniels was invited by Snapchat to create one of the first [[augmented_reality_and_apple_vision_pro | augmented reality]] filters for their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. He was among the first programmers to gain access to Snapchat's filter creation tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. He developed an AR experience that transforms the user into an astronaut by displaying a virtual helmet when the phone is held in front of them, and a rocket launches if they open their mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. His work on augmented reality filters for Niantic (Pokemon Go producer) in a hackathon led to a documentary about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Medical Training - Neurosurgery VR
Daniels contributed to a revolution in medical training by co-creating one of the first interactive educational tools for Stanford University, designed to teach neurosurgery using VR technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. He envisions doctors using AR in hospitals to visualize X-rays and analyze medical data in new ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## The "Magic" of AI and AR
Daniels perceives [[advances_in_robotics_and_ai_integration | augmented reality]] and mixed reality as akin to "magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>, comparing it to how people viewed Edison's electric light bulb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. He notes that while many people are more drawn to [[artificial_intelligence_progress_and_future | AI]], this is likely due to more extensive research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. He believes this will change significantly with the market entry of [[augmented_reality_and_apple_vision_pro | Apple Vision Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

## Future Prospects and Personal Mission
Daniels' personal mission is to democratize AR and VR for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>, believing that just as mobile phones became ubiquitous globally, AR/VR glasses will too, potentially replacing the iPhone in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. He holds optimism for the future of AR and VR, despite some concerns about excessive human dependence on [[artificial_intelligence_development_and_control | Artificial Intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. He reiterates that AR will ensure humans maintain an important role as active participants in the world, keeping it human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

Daniels was inspired to pursue AR/VR by Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Super Mario games, who told him that the future of games and exciting technology lies in virtual and augmented reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. This convinced Daniels to specialize in these technologies, believing they are the future that will push society forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

[[String theory | String theory]] is a concept that emerged around 1984, during what was termed the "string revolution" in physics [00:01:51]. Initially, it was optimistically and "senselessly" called the "theory of everything" [00:02:01]. This theory aimed to answer fundamental questions, such as the number of dimensions we live in [00:01:18]. Professor Krzysztof Majner dedicated 17 years to studying [[string_theory | string theory]], even writing his doctoral thesis on the subject [00:00:21], [00:01:31], [00:01:33]. However, he ultimately found that it did not fulfill its initial promise [00:01:38].

## Limitations and Criticisms

Despite its initial hype, [[string_theory | string theory]] presented several significant limitations:

*   **Failure to Answer Basic Questions**
    Professor Majner concluded that [[string_theory | string theory]] does not answer the basic questions he asked himself when he began his research [00:00:24], [00:01:38].

*   **Impact on General Relativity**
    According to Professor Majner, [[string_theory | string theory]] "ruins" the general theory of relativity [00:00:27]. He emphasizes the incredible beauty of Einstein's theory and its equations [00:00:31], [00:03:30]. In [[string_theory | string theory]], gravity is merely one of many manifestations and its inherent beauty is not visible or distinguished [00:03:40], [00:03:45].

*   **Lack of Correspondence to Observed Reality**
    To this day, no version of [[string_theory | string theory]] has been created that accurately describes or corresponds to the world we observe [00:00:38], [00:02:26].

*   **Multiplicity of Theories**
    It was initially believed that there was only one [[string_theory | string theory]], which contributed to the "theory of everything" moniker [00:02:09]. However, it turned out that there are actually many such theories [00:02:18].

*   **Nature of "Strings"**
    The "strings" in [[string_theory | string theory]] are not flexible as one might imagine, but rather rigid, rod-like objects [00:02:34], [00:02:40]. These objects are billions of times smaller than an atomic nucleus, making them effectively point objects at low energies, thus transitioning into the theory of elementary particles [00:02:43], [00:02:50]. Despite this, no [[string_theory | string theory]] exists today that can derive the known elementary particles after this transition [00:02:54], [00:02:57].

*   **Inability to Describe the Early Universe**
    [[String_theory | String theory]] has not provided answers regarding what happens in the very early universe, a period where the theory of elementary particles breaks down [00:03:05], [00:03:08].

*   **Simplistic Approach**
    Professor Majner characterized [[string_theory | string theory]] as "too simple" to solve the complex problems it set out to address [00:04:14]. He states that it hasn't genuinely contributed to understanding what physicists want to comprehend [00:04:40].

## Mathematical Contributions

While its contributions to physics have been questioned, [[string_theory | string theory]] has had a significant impact on mathematics. It is noted that the Fields Medal, considered the mathematical equivalent of the Nobel Prize, has been awarded for work stemming from [[string_theory | string theory]] applied to mathematics [00:04:23], [00:04:31], [00:04:35].

## Conclusion

Due to these significant limitations, Professor Majner left [[string_theory | string theory]] in the 1990s, pursuing other areas like "horse symmetry" [00:03:51], [00:03:54]. He still views [[string_theory | string theory]] as a "beautiful nice try" and a "very interesting idea," but ultimately one that did not solve the fundamental problems it aimed to address [00:04:00], [00:04:07], [00:04:10].

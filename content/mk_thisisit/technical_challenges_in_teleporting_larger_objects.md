[[Teleportation and quantum mechanics | Teleportation]] is an artificial process that does not occur naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. In the context of physics, it involves the transfer of information or "soul," not matter itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. As physicist Den Greenberger reportedly stated, "teleportation is not transferred matter, only the soul is transferred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This means that for teleportation to occur, an object must already be present at the target location, ready to have its state transformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## Limitations of Macroscopic Teleportation

While [[Teleportation and quantum mechanics | teleportation]] has been achieved with elementary particles, such as the polarization of a single photon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, extending this to larger objects like a human being is considered "beyond the possibilities of the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The fundamental challenges lie in the nature of quantum mechanics and the resources required for such a process.

### Complexity of States

For a single photon, there are only four possible Bell states, and its polarization has two dimensions, meaning only two different results can be obtained during measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This relative simplicity allows for quantum teleportation experiments.

However, as an object's complexity increases, the number of possible states expands exponentially. For a glass made up of conventionally 10^25 to 10^26 atoms, the number of Bell states that would need to be "caught in a controlled way" would be the square of that immense number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This makes performing the necessary Bell measurement for large objects practically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

### The Case of an Atom

Even for a single hydrogen atom, which is the simplest atom, there are infinitely many possible energy states for its electron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. Teleporting such an atom in any arbitrary state would necessitate a measurement of infinitely many Bell states, which is mathematically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

While it's possible to entangle atoms in specific, prepared states (e.g., only two significant states for a particular atom), this is not true teleportation of an arbitrary state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. Such experiments, while difficult, involve preparing an atom in a chosen superposition of states, which is analogous to the two distinguishable polarization states of a photon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

### Comparison to Other Impossibilities

The impossibility of teleporting macroscopic objects is likened to the impossibility of [[possibility of faster than light speed | faster-than-light travel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. While the latter is a strict law of nature in [[physics_of_fasterthanlight_travel | physics]], the former is a "weaker" impossibility due to the immense resources of the universe that would be required to perform the necessary experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. Therefore, the statement that "never teleport an object" is true in the sense that one can only teleport its state, requiring a pre-existing object to receive that state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.

<div class="callout warning">
The professor's analogy of never teleporting an object, only its state, highlights a crucial distinction: true matter transfer of a complex object is not possible based on current quantum understanding.

## Experimental Context

The concept of quantum [[teleportation and quantum mechanics | teleportation]] is intrinsically linked to [[quantum computers and their challenges | quantum mechanics]] and the behavior of particles in the microworld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The act of observation in the microworld significantly changes information about the observed object, unlike in the macroscopic world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This fundamental difference is key to understanding quantum phenomena, including teleportation.

Pioneering experiments on [[engineering_challenges_in_the_development_of_quantum_computers | quantum information]] and entanglement, including those that involved [[teleportation and quantum mechanics | teleportation]], were recognized by the Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. These breakthroughs involved forcing interference between independently emitted photons by controlling the time resolution of detection below the coherence time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. This allowed for the exchange of entanglement, a crucial step in quantum information theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

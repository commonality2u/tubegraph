Artificial intelligence (AI) is viewed as a transformative force, akin to past industrial revolutions, with the potential to reshape societies and economies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The current era is considered the very beginning of AI's development, offering unprecedented opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Poland's Ambition in the AI Era

Poland aims to leverage [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_impact_on_society | artificial intelligence]] to become one of the top 10 richest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. This ambition is supported by strong political will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> and the presence of world-class programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, with Polish universities highly valued for IT education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>. Being "behind" in some areas, like digitization, can be an advantage, allowing the country to implement best practices from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.

A new advisory body on [[artificial_intelligence_and_societal_impact | artificial intelligence]] has been created in Poland's Ministry of Digital Affairs, tasked with helping Poland make this "civilizational leap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. This body will focus on 10 specific projects, many of which are groundbreaking globally, to ensure focused effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

## The Current State and Future of AI Development

The recent breakthrough in [[artificial_intelligence_progress_and_future | artificial intelligence progress and future]] has been the "Transformer architecture" underpinning large language models like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. While initially a "shock" for many, especially the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, experts who had seen earlier models like GPT-2 were less surprised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

In the coming five years, AI models are expected to:
*   Solve algorithmic and mathematical problems at "World Championship" levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   Revolutionize drug discovery, building on advancements like AlphaFold for protein folding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   Accelerate technological progress by enabling faster data processing and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

The future of AI lies not just in language models, but in **multimodal models** that process text, image, sound, and other signals to build a "model of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This includes understanding causality and real-world consequences of actions, which current language models lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

General [[artificial_intelligence_and_future_prospects | artificial intelligence and future prospects]] (AGI) would possess this "model of the whole world of understanding," including forward predictions and understanding of human emotions like empathy, which are currently missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Society and Daily Life

AI is expected to significantly impact daily life:

*   **Assistance**: AI can assist with complex daily tasks, from suggesting dinner based on fridge contents and personal health data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a> to automating party planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>.
*   **Government and Law**: AI can help streamline administrative processes and assist in creating new legislation by identifying contradictions, predicting long-term consequences, and finding legal loopholes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: [[role_of_artificial_intelligence_in_society | The role of artificial intelligence in society]] in healthcare will move towards predictive medicine, using vast data banks to understand disease histories, predict health development, and focus on prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.

## Ethical and Societal Challenges of AI

The rapid advancement of AI presents several challenges and risks:
*   **Job Displacement**: While technology automating work has historically led to positive outcomes, the potential for job loss with AI is a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.
*   **Loss of Control**: As AI systems become more capable and integrated, there is a risk of humanity giving up too much control over its own lives and world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **Ethical Concerns**:
    *   **Transparency and Explainability**: Ensuring that AI models are explainable (why a decision was made) and transparent (how a process occurred) is crucial for trust and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.
    *   **Misuse and Abuse**: Technologies like voice cloning, while having beneficial uses, can be abused by criminals to spread misinformation or deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
    *   **Bias and Discrimination**: It is vital that AI models do not discriminate or reproduce prejudices from their training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.

## The Role of the State and Education

To navigate the [[role_of_new_technologies_and_ai_in_society | role of new technologies and AI in society]], states have a critical [[ethical_and_societal_impact_of_ai_development | role of new technologies and AI in society]] to:

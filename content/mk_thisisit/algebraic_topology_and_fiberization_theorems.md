An article by an outstanding Polish mathematician was recognized as the best article in [[algebraic_topology | algebraic topology]] in the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This distinction, received at an award ceremony in Beijing, was given for a paper on the *TZD property for the automorphism of free groups* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:15">[02:54:15]</a>. Although the article is not directly about [[algebraic_topology | algebraic topology]], it fell under this field for the purpose of the award, as group theory does not have its own separate category in this particular recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:24">[02:29:24]</a>. The achievement also contributed to the mathematician's promotion to a full professor at Oxford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:49">[02:48:49]</a>.

## Symmetries of Symmetries

The award-winning work relates to what has been popularized in Polish media as "the symmetry of all symmetries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:52">[02:49:52]</a>. This concept refers to the automorphism groups of free groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a>, which are considered universal symmetries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a>. The research proved that these groups are very similar to classical groups (like special linear groups) that appear universally in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:09">[03:12:09]</a>. These classical groups are used in various fields, including sorting algorithms, number theory, and [[geometry_and_spacetime | geometry]], controlling classical geometries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:05">[03:33:05]</a>.

A key finding was that these groups possess property (T), which means they can be symmetries of certain objects but never of cyclic spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. The research further demonstrated that the symmetries of all symmetries also cannot be symmetries of Euclidean spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:13">[03:57:13]</a>. This theorem allows for the creation of new expander graphs with additional properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:04">[04:20:04]</a>. Expanders are crucial for fast data processing in fields like sorting algorithms and daily algorithmics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. The proof of this theorem involved a significant computational aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:07">[03:10:07]</a>.

## Fiberization Theorem

A second major theorem discussed by the mathematician is related to [[mathematical_theorem_on_fibration | fiberization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. [[mathematical_theorem_on_fibration | Fiberization]] is a phenomenon in which a space can be understood as a smaller object that changes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:04">[04:57:04]</a>. For example, spacetime can be seen as a two-dimensional sphere (the surface of the Earth) changing in time, creating a three-dimensional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:01">[04:59:01]</a>. Each point on the sphere, as it moves through time, leaves a "fiber" or streak, and the entire space is composed of these fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:05">[05:01:05]</a>. This concept involves reducing a space by one dimension and considering how objects evolve through time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

The speaker's theorem builds upon a theorem by Jan Ig concerning three-dimensional varieties with [[hyperbolic_and_higher_dimensional_spaces | hyperbolic geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:07">[05:09:07]</a>. While Ig's theorem uses specific tools for three-dimensional manifolds, this new theorem generalizes the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:09">[05:17:09]</a>. It shows that if an object, especially a three-dimensional manifold, possesses a certain algebraic property, it will [[mathematical_theorem_on_fibration | fiberize]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:08">[05:27:08]</a>. This means that if the algebraic property is present, the space can be "separated" or broken down into fibers, regardless of its initial dimensionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:06">[05:40:06]</a>. Colleagues from the United States have recently found a simpler proof for this [[mathematical_theorem_on_fibration | fiberization]] theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:09">[04:17:09]</a>.

The mathematician's work often involves looking at [[hyperbolic_and_higher_dimensional_spaces | higher dimensional situations]], particularly spaces with an odd number of dimensions, such as 130 dimensions, where particles spread out rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:03">[01:52:03]</a>. The goal is to demonstrate that such a space always originates from a higher dimension (e.g., 136 dimensions) that changes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>. This approach makes it easier to visualize and understand complex spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:09">[02:11:09]</a>.

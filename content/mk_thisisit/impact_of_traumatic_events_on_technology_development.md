Professor Andrzej Targowski, a pioneer of Polish computer science and recognized as one of the fathers of Polish teleinformatics in public administration, has developed his [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry|technological advancements and societal impact|technological philosophy]] through deeply traumatic personal experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. His work, including the creation of the PESEL system and the concept of an information highway predating the internet, is intrinsically linked to his empathetic view of [[ethics of technology and human interaction|human interaction with technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

## Personal Traumas and Their Influence

Professor Targowski recounts two significant attacks that shaped his perspective:

*   **Warsaw Uprising Attack** In 1944, during the Warsaw Uprising, his house was targeted by German soldiers seeking to cut off support for AK (Home Army) soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. During this assault, his nanny was killed while shielding him, saving his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. His mother also survived a burst of machine gun fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. This early experience, involving extreme violence and the loss of a loved one, instilled a profound understanding of vulnerability and the critical need for systems that protect and serve people.
*   **1988 Attack in the Polish People's Republic** On November 22, 1988, Professor Targowski was the victim of a second attack, which he attributes to the Polish People's Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. This occurred due to his political activism, including extensive writing in the Polish press and participation in broadcasts for Radio Free Europe and Voice of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. One person was killed in this incident, and Professor Targowski sustained serious injuries, including a concussion and seven broken ribs, after being run over by a heavy car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. His life was saved by voluntarily wearing seatbelts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

These events have profoundly influenced Professor Targowski, leading him to advocate for a human-centric approach to technology. He states that [[ethics of technology and human interaction|computer science cannot attack customs; it must support a person]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

## Pioneering Technological Concepts with a Human Focus

Professor Targowski's major contributions reflect his commitment to people-focused technology:

*   **PESEL System**
    *   He is considered the "father of the Polish PESEL system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. The PESEL system is a national population register, conceived as a fundamental number to count and distinguish people for the purpose of introducing social benefits, similar to how Social Security was introduced in the US in 1935 to alleviate economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
    *   The concept, though not fully implemented in Poland as he envisioned, was designed to serve as a basis for information exchange between national systems and to focus on the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.
*   **Information Highway / National IT System**
    *   Eleven years before the internet became popularized, Professor Targowski developed a project for a fast internet information highway, later named "Highway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
    *   His concept of a national IT system was born from observing and critically analyzing US computer systems, which he found "wasteful" with excessive reserves of capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>. He aimed to achieve more with fewer computers by knowing precisely what was needed, focusing on efficiency and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>. This system was meant to be the basis for national information exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>.
*   **Digital City Project (Tele-City of Kalamazoo)**
    *   Professor Targowski is recognized as the "father of one of the first digital cities in the history of the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
    *   During a sabbatical in Kalamazoo, Michigan, he implemented a computing center and aimed to connect schools and integrate information systems, successfully securing significant funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>. This project demonstrates his practical efforts to bring technology directly to communities and people.

## Views on Modern Technology and Education

Professor Targowski expresses concern about the current direction of [[technological_advancements_and_societal_impact|technological advancements]]:

*   **Critique of Automation**: He believes that current technological developments, especially the rise of artificial intelligence, increasingly "eliminate human work," leading to a future where many people might be left without meaningful employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:00:00">[28:00:00]</a>. He asserts that [[ethics of technology and human interaction|computer science must support humans, not attack them]], but currently, it attacks and eliminates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:13:00">[29:13:00]</a>.
*   **Education System Flaws**: He criticizes Polish higher education for producing narrow specialists (programmers) rather than holistic "system designers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:00">[20:43:00]</a>. He advocates for "horizontal thinking"â€”a broad, contextual understanding of knowledge, contrasting it with "vertical thinking" which is highly specialized but lacks broader context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:00">[33:41:00]</a>. This broader approach is crucial for innovation, as seen in how innovations often come from those outside a specific field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:53:00">[35:53:00]</a>.
*   **Importance of Wisdom**: Professor Targowski concludes by emphasizing that "knowledge is not wisdom, but the ability to apply knowledge is wisdom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. This highlights his belief that true value comes from the thoughtful and ethical application of technological understanding for the benefit of humanity.

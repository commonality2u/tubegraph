Air quality significantly impacts human health, affecting virtually every organ and system in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While the respiratory system is the most obvious first point of contact for pollutants, these contaminants ultimately penetrate the circulatory system, reaching all parts of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

## Broad Health Implications

From a scientific and epidemiological perspective, it is understood that there is no organ in the human body for which poor [[impact_of_human_activities_on_climate_change | air quality]] does not have very negative effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:17">[07:17:17]</a>. Pollutants, whether particles or gases, first affect the respiratory system, but then penetrate into the circulatory system, from where they are distributed to all parts of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. This means that all bodily systems and associated diseases can be influenced by [[impact_of_human_activities_on_climate_change | air pollution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

Beyond the respiratory system, other systems affected include the reproductive system and the nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

## Specific Health Conditions

### Stroke
[[impact_of_human_activities_on_climate_change | Air quality]] is identified as one of the biggest causes of stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. While it is impossible to directly link an individual's stroke to their exposure to poor air over a period of time, epidemiological studies clearly demonstrate this statistical connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

### Cancer
[[impact_of_human_activities_on_climate_change | Air pollution]] is known to cause cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>, including lung cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

## [[role_of_ecigarettes_and_traditional_cigarettes_in_health | E-cigarettes and Traditional Cigarettes]]

There are various perspectives on the dangers of [[role_of_ecigarettes_and_traditional_cigarettes_in_health | e-cigarettes]] compared to traditional cigarettes, with some voices claiming they are equally dangerous or even more so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. Ultimately, both involve inhaling pollutants or contaminants into the lungs, and both have negative effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. The extent of danger can depend on individual usage patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

While some might suggest that [[role_of_ecigarettes_and_traditional_cigarettes_in_health | e-cigarettes]] could serve as a transition to quitting smoking, this does not appear to be the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. The danger from inhaled contaminants does not increase infinitely linearly; there is a point where a maximum danger is reached, regardless of further increase in exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. Therefore, it is difficult to say which is "better" or "worse" as both are equally bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

## Impact of Airplanes on Air Quality

The contribution of airplanes to overall [[impact_of_human_activities_on_climate_change | air pollution]] is estimated to be around 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. This figure refers to the proportional comparison with other forms of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.

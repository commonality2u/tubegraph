Modern physics faces a significant challenge as new observations, particularly from advanced telescopes, show a decreasing agreement with established theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This unprecedented level of disagreement between theory and experiment in the history of science suggests that physics is at a crossroads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. One area of re-evaluation is the fundamental concept of arithmetic, specifically how basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division apply to physical quantities across different scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The Challenge to Standard Arithmetic

The core of the problem lies in how nature "adds" quantities versus how humans do with conventional arithmetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
For instance, while 2 + 2 = 4 is an "indisputable truth" in standard arithmetic, and 1 + 1 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>:
*   Adding the speed of light to the speed of light results in only one speed of light, not two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This is explained by the fact that adding speeds is a physical process, representing the passage from one moving system to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. When speeds become large, they stop adding in the simple, linear way we expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   This leads to questions: if speed, which is distance divided by time, behaves strangely, then perhaps distance or time, or even division itself, don't add up normally either <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Scale-Dependent Arithmetic

The idea of [[generalized_arithmetic_in_physics | generalized arithmetic]] suggests that fundamental mathematical operations may behave differently depending on the scale of the quantities involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Small Numbers:** For everyday items like apples, 1 + 1 = 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Large Numbers:** When considering enormous quantities, such as the number of hydrogen atoms in the universe, it's questioned whether adding this number to itself truly doubles it in a physically meaningful way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The argument that adding large numbers like hydrogen atoms is inaccurate from a mathematical standpoint is considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. An example is given comparing the number of hydrogen atoms to the possible positions of knobs on washing machines in a city, where the latter can be an astronomically larger yet "imaginable" number that still adds up conventionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Micro, Meso, and Cosmic Scales:** It appears there are different physics for the micro-world, our "meso" world, and the cosmic scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Observations from new telescopes reveal objects that shouldn't exist according to current theory, like stars older than the universe or objects three times too big <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Paradoxes:** The ancient Greek paradox of the heap of sand (Sorites paradox) illustrates this problem: subtracting one grain from a heap still leaves a heap, but repeated subtractions eventually make it cease to be a heap, highlighting the issue of continuous small changes leading to a qualitatively different result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Similarly, adding small increments of speed, if done enough times, would eventually exceed the speed of light, which is not possible according to the [[theory_of_relativity_and_arithmetic | theory of relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This suggests that even small additions might carry subtle corrections that accumulate over many operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Implications for Cosmology: Dark Energy and Dark Matter

The concept of a new arithmetic has profound implications for understanding cosmological phenomena:
*   **Dark Energy:** There's a significant discrepancy between the theoretical estimate and experimental measurement of the cosmological constant associated with [[dark_energy_theory | dark energy]]. Theoretical calculations are off by a factor of 10^120 compared to experimental results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. It's proposed that modifying the arithmetic of time in a specific way could eliminate the need for [[dark_energy_theory | dark energy]] while still matching experimental observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. This means that for very long durations (billions of years), the rule for adding time might change, similar to how speeds add differently at high velocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   **Dark Matter:** While [[dark_energy_theory | dark energy]] might be explained by modified time arithmetic, [[dark_matter_theory | dark matter]] is not as easily explained away by similar "arithmetic tricks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Some alternative theories suggest [[dark_matter_theory | dark matter]] could be a quantum effect, like fluctuations of spin connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

## The [[interplay_between_mathematics_and_physics | Interplay Between Mathematics and Physics]]: Arithmetic as Physics

The discussion raises fundamental questions about [[the_relationship_between_mathematics_and_physics | the relationship between mathematics and physics]]:
*   **Relativity of Arithmetic:** It's proposed that arithmetic itself might be relative, similar to time in [[theory_of_relativity_and_arithmetic | relativity]], with different arithmetic rules for different physical quantities or groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Changing Arithmetic vs. Changing Distance:** One perspective is that we change the arithmetic operations (addition, etc.) while keeping the concept of distance the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The alternative view is to maintain standard arithmetic but modify the concept of distance itself, which is explored in mathematics as metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
    *   Numbers have two structures: arithmetic (for counting/combining quantities like apples) and for measuring distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. These two structures are not inherently linked and can be separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. The common practice of treating them as the same may be a result of human "laziness" that science needs to overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **[[mathematical_interpretations_of_geometric_principles | Mathematical Interpretations of Geometric Principles]]:** This mirrors concepts in geometry. Instead of curved space as in general relativity, one could interpret gravity as a flat space with a "metric tensor field" that defines distances, similar to an electromagnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

## The Sub-Quantum Level and Consciousness

Beyond arithmetic, a profound question in physics is whether there exists a sub-quantum level, deeper than current quantum physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. It's hypothesized that if consciousness is not a classical phenomenon (and is experimentally known to involve quantum processes like photosynthesis), it might reside at a level deeper than quantum mechanics, as the quantum level is seen as statistical, while consciousness involves awareness and probability reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

## Conclusion

The current state of physics suggests a [[paradigm_shift_in_physics_and_arithmetic | paradigm shift]] where the fundamental rules of arithmetic, long considered universal, may need to be re-evaluated. This could lead to a [[generalized_arithmetic_in_physics | generalized arithmetic]] where operations behave differently depending on the scale or context, particularly for concepts like speed and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This means the seemingly simple question "How much is 1+1?" could, in a broader physical context, depend on how "one" is defined and what it means to "add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. The exploration of these concepts represents a new frontier in the [[physics_and_mathematics_their_interplay_and_implications | interplay between mathematics and physics]].

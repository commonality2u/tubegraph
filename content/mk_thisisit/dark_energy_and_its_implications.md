Professor Marek Czachor, a physicist from Gdańsk University of Technology, proposes a revolutionary idea that challenges fundamental assumptions in physics, including the existence of [[concept_of_dark_energy_and_dark_matter | dark energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. He suggests that the universe may operate under a different kind of arithmetic than traditionally understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## The Problem of Dark Energy

Current cosmological models, based on [[the_concept_of_cosmological_constants_and_dark_energy | Einstein's equations]], describe a universe that is expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. However, observations show that this expansion is accelerating, a phenomenon for which the standard theory offers no inherent explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. To account for this accelerated expansion, the concept of [[cosmological_constant_and_dark_energy | dark energy]] was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. The discovery of this accelerated expansion led to the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

Professor Czachor asserts that [[dark_matter_and_universe_composition | dark energy]] may not actually exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. He draws a parallel to the disappearance of the aether concept, which was eliminated by a deeper understanding of the theory of relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Similarly, he believes [[dark_matter_and_potential_new_particle | dark energy]] might be a symptom of an incomplete understanding of how quantities are added in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

## The "Arithmetic of Time"

Czachor proposes an alternative: a new concept he terms the "arithmetic of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. He posits that if nature adds speeds differently (as demonstrated by special relativity where the addition of velocities near the speed of light does not follow simple linear addition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, then other physical quantities, including time, might also be added in a "strange way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

By assuming that time has a certain arithmetic, similar to how speed is added in relativity, Professor Czachor claims he can precisely reproduce the observed data of the universe's accelerated expansion without needing to invoke [[concept_of_dark_energy_and_dark_matter | dark energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. This suggests that the accelerated expansion could simply be a manifestation of the "arithmetic of time" rather than an unknown force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

## Generalized Arithmetic and Experimental Metaphysics

Czachor claims to be the first physicist to introduce these "generalized arithmetic" into physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:39">[01:53:39]</a>. He argues that arithmetic, much like geometry after Einstein's theory of relativity, should be considered a branch of physics rather than a purely abstract mathematical concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:46">[02:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. This perspective transforms "metaphysics"—traditionally a philosophical domain concerning statements that cannot be scientifically confirmed—into "experimental metaphysics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

He highlights that the problem of [[cosmological_constant_and_dark_energy | dark energy]] emerges when we assume the universe adheres to our conventional arithmetic, while the universe might be using its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>. This leads to the idea of a "relativity of arithmetic," analogous to the relativity of geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:46">[02:28:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:46">[02:28:46]</a>. Physicists should experimentally test which type of addition and other operations nature prefers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:52">[02:54:52]</a>.

## Reception and Future Outlook

While Polish scientists may treat his statements as an "oddity," Professor Czachor notes that there are a few people globally, particularly those involved in financial mathematics, who are exploring similar generalized arithmetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. He believes his approach represents a paradigm shift in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, similar to how the theory of relativity changed our understanding of geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. He is convinced that in a hundred years, his ideas will be obvious to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>.

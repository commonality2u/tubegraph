Professor Aleksander Nawrocki, a Pole, is recognized as a co-creator of Java, one of the world's most famous [[programming_as_a_fundamental_skill | programming languages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. His involvement stems from his background as a programmer, a profession he pursued throughout his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

## Co-creation and Role
Nawrocki was primarily responsible for the real-time programming aspects of Java <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. The development of the language was not linked to an academic center but rather conducted by the Institute of Standardization near Bethesda, Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. A team was formed under their direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. At the time of this project, Nawrocki was the vice president of a software company in California, overseeing a large team of over 1000 programming engineers across various offices in Sweden, Germany, England, France, and several U.S. cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

## Origins and Influences
The development of Java emerged from the team's work with Ada, a [[programming_as_a_fundamental_skill | language]] initially used by NASA's military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. The intention was to create something similar to Ada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. An interesting anecdote about its name is that "Java" has nothing to do with coffee; it comes from the location of Bethesda where the project was conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

## Leadership and Challenges
Aleksander Nawrocki led the Java consortium for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. During this period, Microsoft was considered a significant "enemy" due to their desire to own the Java language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

## Impact on Polish Programmers
Professor Nawrocki currently runs businesses with teams of [[education_and_global_impact_of_polish_programmers | programmers]] in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. As a visiting professor at the Lublin University of Technology, he observes a wide range of skill levels among students, with some being exceptionally good and others very weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. He emphasizes that a professional life involves three stages: learning, acquiring knowledge, and developing skills to change the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

He notes a negative aspect of [[education_and_global_impact_of_polish_programmers | education]] in Poland: young people are taught programming too late, despite the availability of modern tools like iPads and iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. He believes this task should fall under the Ministry of Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.

A groundbreaking factory has been established in Berlin, Germany, by a company that specializes in printing light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This facility is the first of its kind globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, pioneering the "science fiction technology" of printing light screens as thin as a sheet of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

## Company Origins and Location Choice

The founders, including the speaker, arrived in Germany during the last wave of emigration before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. They grew up and received their education in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. The decision to locate the company and its factory in Berlin, rather than Poland, was primarily a business one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

The first pilot line for printing thin screens was built in Berlin due to the availability of an entire scientific background and team necessary for the technology's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. Moving the entire team to Poland was considered an extremely high risk, potentially introducing additional private and professional problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. Furthermore, the fully automated system meant employee costs were not a major factor in the location decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

## Technology: Printed Light (OLEDs)

The company's core technology involves printing OLEDs (Organic Light-Emitting Diodes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. These are luminous elements that are flexible and as thin as paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Currently, the technology prints light in red, green, and blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, and the products are primarily single-color luminous elements, without pixels yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to print full screens capable of displaying Ultra HD quality images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

### Groundbreaking Process

The most groundbreaking aspect of this technology is its production process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Traditional OLED production involves complex, expensive, and time-consuming pad welding processes in a vacuum, requiring significant investment (around 100 million euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. To create specific shapes using old methods, expensive masks (100,000 to a million euros each) are needed, making small series production unrealistically expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

In contrast, this company uses standard printers, typically used for color printing, to apply materials directly onto plastic foils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This digital printing method is significantly cheaper and allows for the production of OLED elements in any shape, a feat practically impossible with older processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## Factory and Production Capacity

The factory, opened on March 11 near Berlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, cost approximately 10 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. While this is "crazy cheap" compared to traditional OLED production, it remains a substantial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. A significant portion of the cost (about 3-4 million euros) went into the machines, but the largest investment was in the team of engineers who built the entire production process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

The factory boasts a clean room environment, meeting high cleanliness standards comparable to semiconductor production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. It features full automation, with robots handling substrates from one process to another, eliminating human presence in certain production zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Currently, the line can print about 8,000 square meters of OLEDs per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

## Applications and Future Vision

The technology is incredibly energy-efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, and its potential applications are vast, extending beyond traditional screens. It can integrate light into everyday objects, changing how we interact with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Possible applications include:
*   Integration into clothing to improve visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   Smart plastic packaging that can indicate expired food or provide usage instructions for medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   Board games with interactive, illuminated timers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

The company aims to scale its production to enable mass printing of full-color screens for large-quantity applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. They are currently learning to increase efficiency by focusing on luxury products, which help finance technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

The long-term vision is to change the face of the world, not just aesthetically, but by enabling a more circular society. For example, screens on reusable packaging could eliminate waste and reduce resource consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Future advancements could lead to screens the size of a lens, enabling new applications in human vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. The company anticipates having the first prototypes of mass-produced, cheaper full-color screens within two years, pending successful supply chain testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## Business Development and Challenges

The company's valuation is estimated between 100 and 150 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Despite high valuations, the founders are not interested in selling the company, driven by a larger vision to help humanity and foster a sustainable society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

One of the most significant [[challenges_and_innovations_in_the_aviation_startup_industry|challenges]] in their 10-year journey has been working with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. While technology is relatively straightforward, building a supportive environment for employees and maintaining strong partnerships is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. The relationship with the co-founder, Patryk, based on trust and loyalty, has been fundamental to their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## Global Market and Poland's Role

The company has an indirect cooperation with Walmart, through Buffel Games, which released an interactive board game featuring the company's illuminated element in Walmart stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

The company views [[challenges_of_entrepreneurship_and_innovation_in_poland|Poland]] positively and has begun investing there, with a sales office and plans to develop R&D and production for Polish customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Future production locations will depend on market development and customer density, requiring regional presence for quick delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Polish politics, through initiatives like the PFR and other capital vehicles, has created a favorable environment for startups by addressing capital shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. Poles are seen as naturally more inclined to take risks and pursue seemingly impossible ideas, stemming from their history of fighting for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. This "romanticism" and belief in crazy ideas are considered essential for creating a better world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

### Germany's [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry|Technological Debt]]

Germany is experiencing a "strange feeling" of not being completely free in its actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Historically an export champion and a leading nation, Germany has seen its dominance wane across various sectors, including the automotive industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. There was an "insanely great conservatism" that led to a belief that nothing would change, as evidenced by initial skepticism towards electric cars like Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

This conservatism also extended to infrastructure, with Germans being surprised by the efficiency of Polish trains and their internet connectivity during the European Championships in Poland and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Germany is now in a phase of "chasing" to catch up, understanding that the old ways are no longer sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Despite these challenges, German society, particularly the youth, is seen as very positive, focused on principles and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. German companies are also showing more openness and speed in [[innovation_and_entrepreneurship_in_aviation_technologies|innovation]], collaborating personally and valuing quick solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. This shift is hoped to elevate Europe's overall [[innovation_and_entrepreneurship_in_aviation_technologies|innovation]] level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

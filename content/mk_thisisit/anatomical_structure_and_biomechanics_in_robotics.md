A Polish team of engineers has been developing the world's first [[biomimetic_robots_and_human_imitation | biomimetic robot]], designed to imitate the soft tissues of a human being [01:05:05]. The goal is to create a "synthetic human" that reflects the structure of the human organism, including all its movements and construction [01:40:02]. This approach stems from the belief that no machine can compete with the universality of the human body [00:24:06].

## Inspiration and Research
The development of this robot is deeply rooted in studying human anatomy and biomechanics. Researchers have visited mortuaries approximately 20 times over 10 years to understand how the human body is built [01:18:00]. This extensive study allows them to reproduce the human structure from artificial materials [01:30:17]. When faced with design challenges, solutions are often found by consulting human anatomy [05:21:09]. The team employs medical professionals, including an anatomist, who helps identify missing elements or reasons why something isn't working [10:19:07].

## Replication of Human Anatomy and Biomechanics

The robot's design reflects the human body from the deepest tissue, through bone, to the skin, mirroring human biomechanics [02:40:02].

### Skeletal and Muscular Systems
*   **Artificial Muscles:** The robot utilizes artificial muscles, which necessitated the development of an artificial skeleton [02:49:01].
*   **Bone Shape and Function:** The shape of the bone guides the muscles and tendons, essential for proper muscle function [02:55:08].
*   **Ligaments and Cartilage:** Bones are connected with ligaments, and the robot incorporates anatomical cartilages, bursa, and menisci instead of mechanical hinges or balls [04:55:04].
*   **Fascia:** Fascia are used to guide tendons correctly, ensuring they work at the right angle [03:03:04].
*   **Tendons:** Muscles transfer drive to bones using tendons, guided by retinacula sheaths, just as in a human [03:09:08].
*   **Soft Tissues:** The inclusion of soft tissues, including fat, allows the hand to clench into a ball rather than a cylinder, unlike typical robotic hands [03:26:00]. This also accounts for the non-parallel and slightly dislocated nature of human finger joints [03:38:08].

### Locomotion
The robot is designed to walk naturally, unlike other robots that often exhibit a "duck gait" due to simplifications in their design, such as rigid hip and knee joints [03:53:07]. The robot's design accounts for the rotation in the hip and knee, as well as the soft, multi-boned foot, ensuring a natural walking pattern [04:09:07]. The walking algorithm is developed in a physical simulator and, once perfected, will be uploaded to the robot [19:09:08]. The ultimate goal is for the robot to walk, run, and jump like a human [20:34:04].

### Internal Systems
*   **Circulatory System:** The robot features a high-pressure and low-pressure system, analogous to the aorta and veins, containing fluid [04:39:07].
*   [[internal_energy_systems_in_robots | Internal Energy Systems]]: While currently powered by lithium-ion batteries for short-term operation, the long-term vision includes a digestive system in the stomach where chemical reactions produce flammable gases [12:48:07]. These gases power a diaphragm pump shaped like a heart, which converts gas pressure into water pressure for the muscles [13:42:04]. Lungs will also be used to store excess gas [14:05:07]. This system aims to allow the robot to "eat garbage" for energy [27:02:04].
*   **Nervous System:** A nervous system, mirroring the spinal cord, distributes the main computer's signals to custom electronics throughout the body, similar to the human nervous system [06:23:09].

## Materials and Construction
The robot is constructed primarily from polymers, chosen for their lightness, processability, and cost-effectiveness [05:38:08]. Apart from a small copper valve that translates nerve impulses into mechanical work, the entire body is made of non-metallic, synthetic materials [05:57:04]. The average density of the robot is similar to that of water [05:48:06].

## Integration of Artificial Intelligence
The robot's "brain," or entire computer, is housed in the skull [04:49:08]. While the robot is currently controllable, it does not yet possess an autonomous brain [16:30:04]. Future development includes physical simulations and neural networks to enable autonomous control and manipulation [16:49:03]. The company has an R&D headquarters in Poland and a US headquarters (established in summer 2024) dedicated to developing the AI aspect of the brain [17:26:09]. The goal is for the robot to be fully autonomous, able to stabilize itself and fight gravity using neural networks [18:50:09].

## Purpose and Vision
The primary purpose of this [[applications_and_implications_of_humanoid_robots | robot]] is to serve and assist humans [26:40:07].

### Household and Daily Life
The robot is envisioned to reverse "growing disorder" or entropy in homes, performing tasks like cleaning, cooking, and laundry [15:41:07]. It could maintain order by cleaning immediately when a mess is made [21:49:01].

### Scientific and Societal Development
Beyond domestic tasks, the robot could:
*   Conduct scientific experiments [16:11:06]
*   Create new technologies [16:13:02]
*   Develop civilization [16:15:02]
*   Be sent to other celestial bodies [16:17:03]
*   Work in factories [33:32:05]
*   Enter burning buildings and eliminate disaster effects [33:35:01]

The creator envisions a future where robots are mass-produced, leading to an overproduction of goods and giving humans more time [33:14:04]. This aligns with a utopian vision of a world where everyone is healthy and wealthy, and goods are abundant [34:06:06].

## Distinguishing Features and Ethical Considerations
Unlike many other humanoid robots that prioritize the brain and rigid exoskeletons, this robot focuses on detailed biomechanical replication and soft tissues [16:24:03, 02:37:07]. This design choice also addresses fears of a "Terminator" scenario; because the robot is made of soft, cuttable tissues and breakable bones, it is not designed for warfare and can be easily disabled, unlike metal robots [25:17:09]. The company explicitly prohibits the robot from contact with weapons or harming living beings [36:00:04].

The project does not aim to replicate human cells, emotions, free will, or quantum biological processes like photosynthesis [06:40:08, 24:09:07]. While acknowledging the "Uncanny Valley" phenomenon where realistic robots can cause unease, the developers believe their robot can overcome this by faithfully replicating human facial expressions and movements to the point of being indistinguishable [22:52:03].

## Development and Future
The initial work on the robot's hand took nine years [09:33:09], establishing the biomechanical and anatomical principles [09:55:00]. This knowledge was then rapidly scaled to create the entire robot, including legs, within the last year [09:40:09, 10:15:03]. The first "Alpha clone" models, priced above $100,000, are expected to be available by 2026 [30:08:08, 30:46:04]. Mass production models are anticipated to cost around $20,000 [30:30:08].

The project began when the founder, inspired by a sketch of a robot leg with artificial muscles, discovered the "Maka muscle" invented in 1958 [27:52:06]. The robot was internally dubbed "Golem," reflecting its purpose as a synthetically produced servant from inanimate matter [28:35:05]. Initial development for seven years was largely solitary [13:13:00]. The company gained global attention when a video of its hand went viral, helping to secure initial capital and market interest [29:48:07]. Industries struggling with manual labor, like carbon fiber manufacturing, have shown interest due to the robot's ability to replicate human hand precision [31:01:03].

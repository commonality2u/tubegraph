Poland is recognized globally for its highly skilled programmers, who are considered among the best in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This assertion is not a myth but is supported by the results of the most significant international programming competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Standing in International Programming Competitions
Poland's programmers consistently achieve high rankings in global competitions. Over the last decade, Poland ranks fourth, behind only Russia, China, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Notably, Poland has only one fewer medal than the United States, despite having a population nine times smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. When considering medals per capita, [[polands_success_in_international_programming_competitions | Poland is the world leader]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

Many Polish programmers are medalists of the most important Olympics in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. For instance, Miron Mironiuk, founder of the AI startup Kosmose, employs approximately 30 programmers, nearly all of whom are from Poland, with many being medalists from these international competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## Value of Polish Programming Talent
This exceptional talent in programming is considered a crucial "natural resource" for Poland in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. It is argued that having the world's best programmers is more valuable than new diamond deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Despite possessing such a significant intellectual asset, Poland ranks only 50th in terms of GDP per capita, indicating a need to leverage this potential more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Recommendations for Poland's Future
To capitalize on this [[impact_of_cultural_and_educational_factors_on_polish_programming_talent | intellectual potential]], Miron Mironiuk suggests that Poland, as a nation, needs to act collectively and think in terms of long-term plans (10-year or 25-year) rather than short-term political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. The goal should be for Poland to become one of the top ten largest economies in the world per capita by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

Key areas for focus include:
*   **Wise Regulations**: Developing smart regulations regarding data, taxes, blockchain technology, and [[education_and_global_impact_of_polish_programmers | education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. These regulations should be agreed upon by citizens and entrepreneurs, free from politicization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.
*   **Data Control**: Recognizing that controlling data is key to controlling artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **Global Mindset**: Polish startups and entrepreneurs should not limit their focus to Poland or even Europe but embrace the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. This might require founders to gain international experience by moving abroad temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

Miron Mironiuk emphasizes that his personal success, while partly attributed to luck, is also due to being Polish and having access to the world's best programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. This highlights the inherent advantage Poland possesses in the technological landscape.

Complex numbers are fundamental to understanding [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] and the structure of space-time in certain theoretical frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. They are crucial for describing various physical phenomena, particularly those involving wave functions and fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## What Are Complex Numbers?

A complex number is defined by the inclusion of the square root of minus one (i) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Unlike ordinary mathematics that primarily deals with real numbers, complex numbers combine a real number with an imaginary number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. While often called "imaginary," these numbers are considered just as "real" in mathematics, though they cannot be directly observed or measured in the same way as real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. They create a "very beautiful algebra and mathematical analysis" that extends the ordinary analysis of real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Complex numbers are typically represented on a complex plane, also known as the Wessel plane or Gauss plane, where real numbers lie on one axis and imaginary numbers on another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Each point on this plane represents a unique complex number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Role in Quantum Mechanics

The entire structure of [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] depends on complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Wave Functions**: The wave function of photons or any quantum system is described as a system of complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Schrödinger Equation**: The Singer (Schrödinger) equation, which dictates the evolution of the wave function, is itself a complex equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. To [[understanding_complex_numbers | understand the physics]] of [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]], it is necessary to understand complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Complex Numbers and Frequencies

Complex numbers are crucial for understanding the concept of positive and negative frequencies in [[quantum_field_theory | quantum field theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, particularly for phenomena like light described by Maxwell's equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This separation into positive and negative frequencies is a complicated procedure, often involving decomposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

In the context of the complex plane, functions that extend to one half of the plane represent positive frequencies, while those extending to the other half represent negative frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This provides a clear geometric separation of these frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

## Complex Numbers and Twistor Theory

Twistor theory, developed by Roger Penrose in the 1960s, is one of the most revolutionary theories in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It views the basic element of space-time not as a point, but as a ray of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This theory heavily relies on the mathematics of complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Conformal Invariance

A key property that led to twistor theory was the conformal invariance of Maxwell's equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Conformal invariance means that equations remain consistent regardless of scale, where large and small things are treated equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This concept is particularly useful for describing massless objects like photons, which fit perfectly into a conformal approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Twistor theory aims to describe positive and negative frequencies in a conformally invariant way, unlike standard methods that depend on the geometry's metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Space-time and Twistors

While space-time can be made complex, it doesn't significantly simplify the problem, as it results in an eight-line space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. In twistor theory, the points of space-time are considered secondary constructs, with the basic element being the twistor itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Twistors are more complex than simple light rays, incorporating aspects like the photon's momentum, angular momentum, and spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. A photon with spin is not entirely localized; it "spreads out" and creates a "twisted swistow configuration" that gives the theory its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Twistor theory, in its foundational form, deals with massless objects and is highly adapted to space-time with one time dimension and three spatial dimensions (Minkowski signature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

### Fundamental Confusion and Dual Twistors

Initially, the division in twistor space was related to positive and negative frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. However, it later became more connected to the handedness (right-handed or left-handed spin) of photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. This led to what Penrose calls a "fundamental confusion in twistor theory," where positive frequency and positive helicity occur together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

To address this, the concept of a "dual twistor" was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. Dual twistors are similar to twistors but are "reversed," meaning, for example, a positive frequency might correspond to a negative helicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

### Borons and Quantum Gravity

A recent development involves combining these two concepts—twistors and dual twistors—into a structure called "borons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. This combination is crucial for introducing [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] into the framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.

The process is analogous to the canonical coupling of position and momentum in [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]], a concept central to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. In [[classical_physics | classical physics]], position and momentum operators commute (AB = BA), but in [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]], they do not (AB ≠ BA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. The difference (AB - BA) yields something fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>. Similarly, twistors and dual twistors are canonically conjugated variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>. By creating an algebra that includes both, it allows for the consideration of both left-handed and right-handed helicities simultaneously, which is necessary for a proper [[quantum_gravity | quantum theory]] of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.

This unified approach holds promise for potentially relating to fundamental forces in particle physics, particularly the strong force, and for integrating general relativity into a quantum framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.

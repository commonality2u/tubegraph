The concept of the Big Bang, often considered the beginning of the universe, is challenged by an alternative view that suggests it was not the absolute start of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This perspective, developed around 2004, has observational consequences and posits that the Big Bang was an event that occurred as if "from the distant future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Critiques of [[inflation_theory_and_quantum_particle_production | Inflationary Theory]]

The speaker explicitly negates [[inflation_theory_and_quantum_particle_production | inflation theory]], stating it "disrupts my other theory" and is "not needed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. While acknowledging that inflation was introduced for "good reasons," the speaker asserts that their alternative model provides "other reasons that replace them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The traditional [[inflation_theory_and_quantum_particle_production | inflationary model]] describes a "huge exponential expansion" right after the Big Bang, dramatically increasing the universe's size in a fraction of a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. However, the speaker regards this as a "misleading picture" that "didn't happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Instead, the speaker's model suggests that the exponential expansion observed today is a look "through the big bang to what was before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Introducing inflation "spoils the cosmology" in this alternative framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## The Aeon Concept and Exponential Expansion

The speaker defines an "aeon" as the period extending from the Big Bang to the distant future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Within this aeon, the universe experiences an exponential expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This exponential expansion is characterized by a "self-similar" continuation of expansion, rather than simply meaning "very, very large" scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### The Cosmological Constant

This observed exponential expansion is attributed to the cosmological constant, a concept originally introduced by Einstein for two reasons but later considered his "biggest mistake" before being proven true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The speaker was personally convinced of the cosmological constant's existence by a cosmologist from Princeton, changing their previous assumption that it must be zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The cosmological constant is responsible for the universe's exponential expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The term "dark energy," often used to describe this phenomenon, is considered a "terrible name" by the speaker because it is "not dark or energy in any ordinary sense of the word" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Observational Evidence

The oldest light currently observable is the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, emitted approximately 3 million years after the Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Before this period, the universe was too hot, existing in a plasma state primarily composed of hydrogen and helium nuclei and electrons, preventing light transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The CMB, captured by satellites like Planck, provides an "amazing picture" of the universe at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. To observe earlier periods, physicists must utilize other means, such as neutrons or gravitational waves, as light cannot penetrate further back than approximately 350 million years after the Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## The Cyclic Universe and Black Hole Evaporation

This alternative view of cosmology is consistent with observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. It suggests there is "no end" to the universe; rather, the exponential expansion of our current aeon continues indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This concept directly relates to the [[cyclic_universe_theory | Cyclic Universe Theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

In this model, the future of the universe involves galaxies and clusters being absorbed by supermassive black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Eventually, these black holes will undergo Hawking evaporation, a process taking an extremely long period (around 10^100 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The energy released during this evaporation is theorized to transfer to the "next aeon," creating a single point in the sky that could be observed in that subsequent aeon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This process of black holes absorbing matter and then gradually disappearing through Hawking evaporation is how a previous aeon, which also contained galaxies and black holes, would have contributed to the cosmic microwave radiation observed in our current aeon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This framework, developed by the speaker with collaborators Krzysztof Meissner, Pawe≈Ç Nurowski, and another Korean scientist, suggests a universe with "no beginning and no end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

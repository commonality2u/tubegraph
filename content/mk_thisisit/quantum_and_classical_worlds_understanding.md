Michał Parniak, a Polish physicist, conducts research that aims to deepen the understanding of the [[difference_between_classical_and_quantum_worlds | differences between the classical world and the quantum world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:19">[07:17:19]</a>. His work involves creating quantum states of objects that are "somehow interesting," often by making them macroscopic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

## The Quantum-Classical Boundary

The [[quantum_and_classical_physics_differences | quantum and classical physics differences]] are fundamental:
*   The quantum world is described by non-intuitive laws, expressible mathematically, like the Schrödinger equation, which predicts probabilities of events in the microscopic realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:39">[08:05:39]</a>. However, the exact reason *why* these probabilities are realized remains a postulate, not fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
*   In contrast, the classical world is deterministic, governed by laws like Newton's forces, where initial conditions can predict final conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:08">[08:35:08]</a>.

A central question in physics is where the boundary between these two worlds lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. Scientists question at what point an object with an increasing number of particles suddenly begins to behave deterministically and entirely differently from its quantum description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:02">[08:59:02]</a>. Experimental research focuses on trying to create quantum states of increasingly macroscopic objects to explore this interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:13">[09:13:13]</a>.

## Experimental Approaches to Bridging the Worlds

Parniak's research and related experiments attempt to find "bridges" between the quantum and classical domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:02">[09:59:02]</a>.

### Schrödinger's Cat Analogy
The famous thought experiment of Schrödinger's cat illustrates this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:06">[10:11:06]</a>. It questions why an atom can exist in a [[quantum_mechanics_and_waveparticle_duality | quantum superposition]] (described as quantum), but a cat, connected to this atom by a mechanism, cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. Experiments aim to scrutinize the mechanism that connects the quantum atom to the macroscopic cat, specifically looking at how a quantum object like a photon interacts with a detector and if that detector's operation can also be described quantum mechanically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.

### Macroscopic Entanglement and Mesoscale Objects
Parniak has explored macroscopic entanglement, which is achieving quantum entanglement in larger systems. One experiment in Copenhagen entangled a mechanical membrane (a "drum") with the spins of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. His team in Warsaw also created different macroscopic states using their record-breaking quantum memory, entangling many photons stored in the memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This achieved a state of entanglement with an exceptionally large object, setting a record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

At the Nils Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, Parniak worked on introducing a small membrane, akin to a drumhead but with nanometer thickness and millimeter width, into a quantum state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. This object, considered "mesoscale," had aspects like its vibration introduced into a quantum state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:05">[12:15:05]</a>. They managed to create an interaction between it and individual photons and control this interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

A significant challenge in these studies is achieving the ground state of such mechanical oscillators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>. By using laser cooling to reach temperatures near absolute zero, they observed that the ground state of a mechanical oscillator still contains certain quantum fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. These quantum fluctuations are observable even for macroscopic objects, demonstrating that [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics will not allow for infinite precision in measuring an object's position]], as it retains some movement even at absolute zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.

## Quantum Gravity and Superposition
The bridge between the quantum and classical worlds may ultimately involve the [[theory_of_quantum_mechanics_and_quantum_gravity | quantum theory of gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>. Current experiments, like those in Austria, are attempting to place mechanical oscillators (small balls) into a state of superposition, being in two places at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>. If an object is in a superposition of being in two places, it also has its own gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.

The challenge lies in two areas:
1.  Getting an increasingly macroscopic object into a quantum state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.
2.  Increasing the precision of gravity measurements to detect gravity from smaller objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.
The hope is that these two efforts will meet in a "middle ground" where gravity from an object in [[quantum_mechanics_and_waveparticle_duality | quantum superposition]] can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>.

## Quantum Metrology and Practical Applications

Quantum metrology is a practical field focused on building systems that measure things with enhanced precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. It leverages "tricks" from [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] to reduce quantum noise, a technique known as "squeezing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>. This involves reducing fluctuations in light in one aspect at the cost of increasing them where they don't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.

These techniques are already applied in practical measurements:
*   **Gravitational Wave Detectors:** Operating detectors like LIGO/Virgo in the US, Italy, and Japan use quantum light engineering to double the precision of gravitational wave measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>. This is an example of the [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | interplay between classical and quantum physics]] where concepts from quantum theory improve macroscopic detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>.
*   **Measuring Position:** Measurements of mirror positions face quantum limits. While increasing light can make measurements more classical and reduce fluctuations, it also disturbs the mirrors via photon pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>. There is an optimum level, which can be improved using [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] tricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. Every measurement has its quantum limits, determined by the fluctuations of the measurement tool and the object being measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>.

## Quantum Information and the Universe

Understanding the structure of [[quantum_theory_at_atomic_and_molecular_levels | quantum information]] is a key focus, bringing scientists closer to understanding how quanta work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>. Photons are excellent "workhorses" for quantum information due to the control scientists have over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>.

### Information Encoding
The light spectrum carries information for:
1.  **Chemical Research:** Studying the composition of molecules, such as atmospheric gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>. Parniak's quantum memory acts as a specific quantum processor, able to extract precise spectral lines from photons, allowing for distinguishing very close spectral lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
2.  **Telecommunications:** Packing light's degrees of freedom more efficiently to encode and decode information. This is crucial for improving transmission in optical fibers, especially for long-distance connections like transatlantic cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>. Researchers are inventing protocols to better decode information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>.

### Limits of Encoding Information
While matter might offer unimaginably large limits for information encoding at the elementary particle level, it is not yet practically achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>. For photons (visible light), information can be recorded in:
*   **Polarization:** Associated with the photon's spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09:00">[23:09:00]</a>.
*   **Temporal Degree of Freedom:** For example, a single photon existing in a superposition of being in two distinct light pulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>.

## Future Directions and Astronomical Applications
Future experiments aim to create more universal devices for similar quantum protocols across various light wavelengths, beyond just infrared light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>.

### Black Hole Imaging
The device used to image the black hole, creating the famous image, is not a direct photo but a visualization created by superimposing images from microwave detectors placed globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a>. This technique, which can also be applied in the optical domain, allows for imaging tiny objects by effectively using the entire Earth as a "lens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>. Parniak's team is exploring if their device can perform more precise microwave measurements or extract more information using single photons, potentially leading to a more accurate image of a black hole's event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:00">[25:29:00]</a>. Extending these detectors into space could further increase the "lens" size to the entire solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>.

### Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
Microwaves can also help understand other cosmic structures, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:00">[26:16:00]</a>. This radiation is a remnant of the Big Bang, found everywhere, and its fluctuations can reveal many features of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:23:00">[26:23:00]</a>. While not strictly quantum physics, the goal to measure these microwaves more precisely provides a strong motivation for Parniak's research, alongside motivations like improving communication networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>.

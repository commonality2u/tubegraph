Professor Andrzej Targowski, a pioneer in Polish computer science and technology, discusses significant [[challenges_of_modern_civilization | challenges of modern civilization]], particularly concerning the [[impact_of_technology_on_human_society | impact of technology on human society]]. He expresses concern that current technological developments, especially in [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]], represent a form of "suicide" for civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Dark Side of Technology

Targowski's book, while nominally about IBM's role during the Third Reich, also serves as a commentary on modern times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. He highlights that contemporary social networks function as extensive tools for spying, profiling, and propagating misfortunes, becoming increasingly uncontrollable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. These networks can even direct the electoral process for politicians like Biden and Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The market value of "megatech" companies, like the one owned by Mark Zuckerberg who reportedly donated 300 million to the Democratic party, is dozens of times greater than traditional industries, such as car companies, which were once America's number one industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

## Artificial Intelligence: A Civilizational Suicide?

Professor Targowski likens the current trajectory of [[technological_advancements_and_societal_impact | technological advancements and societal impact]] to the "suicide of civilization," with [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] being the primary driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. He suggests that the "sentence has already been executed" regarding the impact of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. While some view [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] as offering a chance for humans to transcend current limitations, others, including Targowski, see it as potentially leading to "the end of the evolution of the human species" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

Funding for [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] development is massive, with businesses investing an estimated half a trillion dollars annually across several countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. The President of the World Monetary Fund stated that 40% of jobs will eventually be influenced by AI, effectively ceasing to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### The Problem of Certification and Responsibility

A significant [[commercialization_challenges_and_collaborations | commercialization challenge]] with [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] lies in accountability. Professor Targowski cites the example of an "expert system" invented at Stanford University 50 years ago that was more effective at diagnosing meningitis than doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. However, the question of who is responsible for bad practice from such systems remains unanswered, as no certification mechanism for AI exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

### AI vs. Nuclear Bomb: A Question of Access

Professor Targowski compares [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] to a nuclear bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. While nuclear technology's secrets and production are exclusive to a few centers, preventing widespread misuse, AI is readily accessible to everyone from morning till night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

### The Fourth Industrial Revolution and Loss of Work

Professor Targowski disputes the common perception, especially from the Davos congress, that the current "fourth industrial revolution" driven by [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] and automation is entirely positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. He argues that while previous industrial revolutions created cyclical work, the current one eliminates it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. He draws a parallel to Poland's experience when state farms (PGR) were eliminated, leading to a million people losing jobs, falling into debt and alcoholism, despite receiving benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. He stresses that work is fundamental for human development, and its elimination leads to the "suicide in the sense of higher humanities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

## Minds in Modern Civilization

Professor Targowski categorizes human minds based on their development and interaction with technology:

*   **Basic Mind** – Possessed by everyone, including common sense, and empirical knowledge gained from experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
*   **Reasoning Mind** – Developed through higher education, enabling understanding of complex concepts like the Earth not being flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.
*   **Global Mind** – Acquired through travel and learning languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.
*   **Universal Mind** – Based on one's system of values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.
*   **Digital Mind** – Enables the use of digital libraries and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
*   **Virtual Network Mind** – Developed through engagement with social networks, absorbing, confronting, adapting, and seeking compromise based on collective wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Mind** – Involves integrating technology with the human body, such as through transplants, which Targowski believes should be prohibited as it goes against nature and could lead to the creation of "superhumans," further stratifying society into "better and worse" people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.

The evolution of the mind is no longer solely determined by biology but by the IT civilization and its tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.

## Repeating Mistakes and Societal Stupidity

Targowski suggests that modern society is "absolutely repeating" the mistakes of the past, even describing it as "suicide suicides" who are happy and proud of their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. He observes that when people or nations are poor, they tend to be smart and creative, but once they acquire wealth, they become "stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>. He posits that America is currently becoming "stupid" due to its economic prosperity, leading to a diminished concern for critical political and societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.

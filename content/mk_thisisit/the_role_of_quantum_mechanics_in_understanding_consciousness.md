The question of what consciousness is has been a subject of research for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. While some theories suggest a link to quantum phenomena, it's also possible that consciousness is a problem of classical mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Classical vs. Quantum Mechanics
The possibility that consciousness is rooted in classical mechanics rather than [[quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] cannot be ruled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. While arguments might not strongly push towards one over the other, there is freedom to include [[quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] in these considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:12">[02:11:12]</a>.

One perspective, championed by Roger Penrose, posits that human [[quantum mechanics and consciousness | consciousness arises from quantum phenomena]] within the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:32">[01:57:32]</a>. This idea is intriguing because it implies moving beyond traditional classical electrical engineering and differential equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Achieving immense computational power could involve creating systems that genuinely rely on [[quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]], rather than just using it within classical limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

However, determining the exact role [[quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] plays in [[quantum physics and consciousness | consciousness]] is considered a secondary issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>. It is not possible to definitively state whether [[quantum physics and consciousness | consciousness]] is purely a matter of classical or [[quantum physics and consciousness | quantum physics]] without a deeper understanding of its relationship to other phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

## Neurons and Collective Behavior
A key question in understanding [[quantum mechanics and consciousness | consciousness]] is whether neurons should be considered independent systems or as elements exhibiting collective behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Language, for instance, might be a collective behavior describable at a higher level, not relying on every detail of lower-level phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

The idea of "essence" over "details" is crucial. Modern physics aims to capture the essence of a phenomenon rather than all its intricacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. This approach has been found more advantageous in creating artificial neural networks, which imitate biology's essence without slavishly copying every minute detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Trying to slavishly imitate every detail consumes computer resources and provides little insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. When the essence is found, it can be applied universally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

Collective systems, such as phase transitions, have been instrumental in understanding biology and physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. The concept that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" applies here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.

## Limitations of Current AI and Biological Learning
Current learning systems in AI often do not consider synaptic weights as dynamic variables at the same level as dynamic activity variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This separation might not preserve the computational power developed through biological evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. There is an expectation that future developments in neural networks will focus on understanding the real learning algorithms in biology and how to incorporate their essence into engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Biological synapses, for instance, exhibit noise and do not change in infinitesimal quantities, unlike many AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Predicting the future development of neural networks, particularly concerning how neuron activity and machine states will be described, remains challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. The choice of dynamic model (e.g., continuous variables or action potentials with delays) will significantly influence future possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. If we don't know which model will dominate, we have no idea where the field will be in ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the Nobel Committee's decision to honor work on neural networks is seen not just as a tribute to AI but as an emphasis on science in a broader context, enabling diverse engineering applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Physics should look at seemingly unsolvable problems rather than limiting itself to narrow classifications like "AI or not AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

ISAR, a company founded by Rafał Modrzewski, specializes in the design, building, and operation of microsatellites for Earth observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The company, headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, is valued at over a billion dollars and is recognized as the world's largest commercial microsatellite network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. The Financial Times recognized it as the 30th fastest-growing company in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Microsatellite Technology

ISAR's core technological breakthrough is the miniaturization of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>. This represents a significant change, reducing satellite mass and price by an order of magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:34:00">[26:34:00]</a>.

### Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
SAR is an instrument that takes pictures using radar technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>. It works by sending an electromagnetic energy pulse (a radio wave at 10 GHz) that passes through the atmosphere and clouds, bounces off the ground, and returns to the satellite to be recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. This process makes it independent of sunlight and atmospheric conditions, ensuring images look the same day or night, rain or shine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>.

### Miniaturization and Constellation Philosophy
Traditional large SAR satellites weighed over a ton, cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and took 5 to 10 years to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:00">[26:49:00]</a>. They constantly had their radar on, consuming vast amounts of electricity, producing heat, and collecting immense data, requiring complex management systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>.

ISAR's approach shifts the focus from continuous global observation to frequent, targeted observation of specific points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>. Their first miniature radar satellite weighed 66 kg instead of one ton and measured 3 meters instead of 10 meters, significantly reducing construction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>. This allows for the rapid deployment of dozens of satellites, creating a constellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40:00">[27:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>.

This constellation model also redefines reliability: instead of one highly reliable, expensive satellite, the system is composed of dozens of units where the failure of one doesn't cripple the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:00">[21:35:00]</a>. This approach allows for faster building by accepting slightly more risk, similar to Elon Musk's strategy with Starlink, where some satellites may fail, but the overall system remains robust due to redundancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>.

### Space Debris Management
To mitigate the problem of electronic waste in space, ISAR's microsatellites are equipped with small ion or rocket engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:13:00">[24:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>. At the end of their mission (when imaging capabilities decline or technology becomes outdated), these engines deorbit the satellite, causing it to burn up completely in the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:30:00">[24:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>.

## Applications of Microsatellite Technology
Initially, ISAR's company was founded to observe ice in the Arctic due to climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Radar was chosen because it is superior to optical cameras for ice observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This allowed them to enable ships to travel through the Arctic Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

Today, ISAR's technology has diverse applications, including:

*   **Military and Security:**
    *   **Ukraine War:** Since 2022, ISAR's constellation has been actively used to assist the Ukrainian army, observing the deployment of Russian troops and analyzing their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:25:00">[31:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>. Their information was used to predict the timing of the invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:00">[32:09:00]</a>.
    *   **"Illuminate and Expose" Strategy:** This new military strategy, based on these experiences, involves collecting and publicly distributing intelligence information to counteract attacks by removing the element of surprise from an enemy's plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>.
    *   **US Department of Defense (DoD):** The DoD is one of ISAR's largest clients, using their constellation for observing situations in Ukraine and elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:33:00">[33:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:00">[33:57:00]</a>. ISAR is an exception as the DoD rarely uses non-American technologies for intelligence gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Future Military Operations:** Space will be an integral part of future military operations, both in peacetime (for reconnaissance) and wartime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:38:00">[57:38:00]</a>.

*   **Civilian and Other Applications:**
    *   **Volcano Prediction:** Working with the meteorological institute in Iceland, ISAR analyzed changes in terrain height around a volcano, accurately predicting an eruption a week in advance and enabling successful evacuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:24:00">[29:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:12:00">[39:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Flood Monitoring:** During a flood in Lower Silesia, Poland, ISAR's satellites were programmed to observe the flood wave, providing crucial radar photos when optical photos were useless due to clouds and rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>. This demonstrates how satellites save property and lives by enabling more efficient aid distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:06:00">[58:06:00]</a>.
    *   **Forest Observation:** Users in Finland utilize the constellation to monitor their forests for health and potential damage without needing to travel to remote locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:23:00">[36:23:00]</a>.
    *   **Glacier Movement:** By observing mountains over several weeks, ISAR was able to create a video showing not only the movement of glacier fronts but also changes in the entire ice structure, which fascinated researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:16:00">[38:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Future Development:** ISAR aims to further reduce observation frequency to 30-2 minutes, requiring over 100 satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:49:00">[34:49:00]</a>. They also plan to add other types of imaging, such as radio emission observations (Signal Intelligence or Electronic Intelligence), optical data, and thermal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:07:00">[35:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Democratization of Data:** A core idea from the company's inception is to collect extensive data about the Earth's surface and share it with government, corporate, and civilian users worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:44:00">[35:44:00]</a>.

## Company Background and Growth
ISAR was founded by Rafał Modrzewski, originally from Katowice, Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. His fascination with physics led him to study electronics at the Warsaw University of Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. During an Erasmus program in Finland, he joined the Aalto-1 project, building a small cubet satellite, which made him realize satellites could be built faster, cheaper, and by smaller teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. He and co-founder Pekka decided to turn this experience into a commercial company, focusing on satellites despite Rafał's initial idea for LCD screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Neither co-founder completed their university degrees, choosing instead to focus on developing the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

The company has grown rapidly, from two people to over 700 employees in 10 years, with revenues projected to reach $250 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:04:00">[43:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:22:00">[43:22:00]</a>. They are multinational, with 71 nationalities among their staff and offices in Spain, Great Britain, and the US, though they prefer to remain a European company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. Many employees, in addition to Silicon Valley and European investors, are also owners of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:15:00">[44:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:18:00">[44:18:00]</a>. ISAR refuses to cooperate with Russia or China, citing illegality and company values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:34:00">[41:34:00]</a>.

## Vision for Poland's Role in Space
Rafał Modrzewski sees his role in Poland as having three key tasks:
1.  **Developing the Polish office:** The Polish office is the second largest in the company and is slated for even faster development due to the significant access to talent in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:45:00">[48:45:00]</a>.
2.  **Promoting a culture of risk-taking:** He believes in encouraging young people to build things that seem impossible, drawing from his own experience of developing SAR at 22 despite being told it was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:11:00">[49:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:40:00">[49:40:00]</a>. He emphasizes that youth helps in taking on such challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:09:00">[50:09:00]</a>.
3.  **Raising awareness about space:** Modrzewski stresses the importance of educating the public and politicians about space as a critical, rapidly growing new branch of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:10:00">[51:10:00]</a>. Poland has an incredible chance to become a leader in the space race but is not currently utilizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:52:00">[51:52:00]</a>.

Modrzewski advocates for increased funding for Poland's space sector, comparing it to investments made by countries like Japan and India in their space industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:21:00">[52:21:00]</a>. He emphasizes that investing in new technologies, including space, [[applications_of_protein_engineering_in_medicine_and_technology | new drugs]], and [[quantum_computing_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology | quantum computers]], is crucial for creating additional value in the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:51:00">[54:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:05:00">[55:05:00]</a>. He warns against focusing solely on one sector, such as [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology | artificial intelligence]], and calls for space to be explicitly included in national development strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:16:00">[54:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:56:00">[55:56:00]</a>. Space technology is vital for national security, future military operations, and civil security (e.g., flood monitoring) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:15:00">[57:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:02:00">[58:02:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Reflections
Rafał Modrzewski's most difficult personal moment was transitioning from hands-on engineering to managing a large company, requiring him to delegate technological development to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:09:00">[45:09:00]</a>.

He expresses concern that societies are not ready for the rapid pace of technological solutions, which appear faster than humanity can learn to properly use or control them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. He highlights that every modern technology, from [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_applications_in_science_and_technology | artificial intelligence]] to satellites, has both good and bad applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. Democratic systems must adapt legal structures to keep pace with these new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.

Modrzewski strongly emphasizes the importance of education, particularly high schools and primary schools, as the foundation for future companies and new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>. He believes that education shapes young, educated, and open individuals who are not afraid to dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.

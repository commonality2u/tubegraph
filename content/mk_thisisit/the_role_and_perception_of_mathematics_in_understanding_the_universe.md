The discussion explores the multifaceted [[role_of_mathematics_in_understanding_the_universe | role and perception of mathematics]] in comprehending the cosmos, delving into whether mathematical concepts are discovered or invented and their relationship to objective truth.

## Mathematics as a Descriptive Tool
Mathematics is utilized to describe the properties of the external world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. Concepts like general relativity or quantum mechanics are considered [[physics_and_mathematics_their_interplay_and_implications | mathematical approaches]] designed to capture the truth about physical processes occurring in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. For instance, [[role_of_mathematics_in_describing_reality | mathematical equations]] are employed to predict the distant future of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Inventing vs. Discovering Mathematical Concepts
A central debate revolves around whether mathematical concepts are discovered or invented. While most mathematicians believe that mathematical concepts exist independently and are waiting to be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>, an opposing view suggests that humans **invent** mathematical concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. This perspective argues that there is no possibility of mathematics existing outside of us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

From this viewpoint, mathematics is a language developed by humans to grasp observations in the world quantitatively and precisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. Mathematical theorems and proofs are seen as truths that emerge *within* this invented language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. They would be meaningless without the language of mathematics, which is itself invented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

Consider the Pythagorean theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. The concepts of a triangle, a line, or a right angle are human inventions; there is no perfect right angle in the external world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. Humans create these concepts, and then discover interesting features about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

Most mathematicians reject this idea because they base the validity of their work on searching for external, pre-existing truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. However, the counter-argument is that the Pythagorean theorem only has meaning when it resonates within a mind that can understand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. If no thinking structures remain in the distant future, the theorem would cease to "exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. To suggest that [[independent_existence_of_mathematics | mathematics exists independently]] of us is considered by some as a belief akin to believing in a deity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

## Mathematics and Truth
Mathematics is considered a tool to capture objective truth about the physical processes in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. These are truths related to the properties of the external world that science attempts to describe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. This contrasts with subjective truths, which are personal beliefs and values that deeply matter to an individual but are not universally objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Distinguishing between these external objective truths and internal subjective truths is considered extremely important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

Roger Penrose, a Nobel Prize winner in physics, has dedicated a significant part of his life to fundamental questions about the universe, including the nature of consciousness and the search for a [[unification_of_gravity_and_quantum_mechanics | grand unification theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. His work is characterized by a multidisciplinary approach, combining mathematics, physics, and philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Black Holes and Singularities

Penrose's Nobel Prize in 2020 was awarded for explaining how the existence of black holes results from the theory of [[quantum_mechanics_and_gravitational_interactions | relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Despite their enigmatic nature, Penrose does not consider black holes the "greatest mystery of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. We have a good understanding of what they look like, their rotation (Ker solution), and how they produce gravitational waves when they collide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Detailed calculations and observations from detectors like LIGO have greatly advanced our knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

A key concept in Penrose's work, and in [[quantum_mechanics_and_gravitational_interactions | general relativity]] more broadly, is the **singularity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. A singularity is a region in spacetime where curvature is large, and preferred curved lines (geodesics) have a beginning but no end, falling into a point that does not belong to spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. In such singularities, the physics as we know it ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

Penrose notes that in black holes, the mathematics we know "breaks down at the point of singularity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. He clarifies that it is not mathematics that fails, but rather our understanding of the physical theory (Einstein's [[interplay_of_general_relativity_and_quantum_mechanics | general theory of relativity]]) becomes inadequate at this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This suggests a need for a theory that connects to [[quantum_mechanics_and_gravitational_interactions | quantum mechanics]], often referred to as [[quantum_mechanics_and_gravitational_interactions | quantum gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## The Challenge of [[unification_of_gravity_and_quantum_mechanics | Quantum Gravity]]

The search for [[quantum_mechanics_and_gravitational_interactions | quantum gravity]] aims to describe the evolution of what happens inside a black hole, going beyond Einstein's theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Penrose expresses skepticism about current approaches to [[quantum_mechanics_and_gravitational_interactions | quantum gravity]], specifically string theory, stating, "I do not believe them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

For Penrose, the more important question is how to "eat" [[quantum_mechanics_and_gravitational_interactions | quantum mechanics]], rather than focusing solely on [[quantum_mechanics_and_gravitational_interactions | quantum gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. He highlights the "absurdity" of [[quantum_mechanics_and_gravitational_interactions | quantum mechanics]] with its [[quantum_mechanics_and_de_brogliebohm_theory | Schrödinger equation]] and the collapse of the wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. He argues that a gravitational effect within [[quantum_mechanics_and_gravitational_interactions | quantum mechanics]] could explain the collapse of the wave function, a concept explored by Hungarian physicist Lajos Diósi before him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. This perspective is considered more directly observable and relevant to how the universe behaves "here and now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

## [[quantum_mechanics_and_relativity | Classical vs. Quantum Reality]]

Penrose distinguishes between classical reality and [[quantum_mechanics_and_relativity | quantum reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.
*   **Classical Reality**: Allows for a specific description of an object's properties (e.g., shape, color) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. You can ask a classical object "what you are" and it will have a definite answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.
*   **[[quantum_mechanics_and_relativity | Quantum Reality]]**: Does not allow for such direct questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>. Using the example of a proton's spin, Penrose explains that while you can confirm if a spin is oriented in a particular direction without disturbing the system (Einstein's element of reality), you cannot simply ask the particle "In which direction are you rotating?" and expect a definitive answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>. Instead, [[quantum_mechanics_and_relativity | quantum reality]] provides probabilistic answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. The "bridge" between these two worlds exists, but it cannot be simply defined by asking for a definite state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>.

## Consciousness and Quantum Effects

Penrose investigates how [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | human consciousness is born from matter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. He connects the quality of understanding, a feature of conscious beings, to this question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. He frequently suggests that conscious information is transformed into consciousness as a result of a [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

Penrose argues that the brain must be quantum, based on a mathematical argument connected to Gödel's theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. He uses examples from mathematics to illustrate that conscious thinking is not like computer processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. While rules can be encoded for computers, Gödel's theorem shows that there are mathematical truths that cannot be proven by those rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. For Penrose, knowing why something is true involves "understanding," which he links directly to [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

He discusses the idea that the choice of [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum state]] might take place in the consciousness of the observer, a concept famously put forth by Hungarian Nobel Prize winner Eugene Wigner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. Penrose himself sees the source of consciousness in the phenomenon of quantum effects within the brain, potentially related to microtubules in the neural network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. While microtubules are ubiquitous in living systems, specific types or their quantum signaling capabilities might be relevant to consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

## The Future of Physics: A New Approach

Penrose advises young scientists to "Combine [[relativity_and_quantum_gravity | general relativity]] with [[quantum_mechanics_and_gravitational_interactions | quantum mechanics]], but not in the way people talk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. He asserts that the "Great Challenge" and the "new Physics" lie in understanding how to "eat" [[quantum_mechanics_and_gravitational_interactions | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.

This perspective suggests that the fundamental breakthroughs might not come from string theory, which Penrose considers a "dead end," but from a deeper understanding of the inherent complexities and apparent absurdities of [[quantum_mechanics_and_gravitational_interactions | quantum mechanics]] itself, especially in relation to [[relativity_and_quantum_gravity | gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.

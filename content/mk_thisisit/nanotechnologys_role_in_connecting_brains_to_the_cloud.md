The concept of connecting human brains to the cloud, allowing for enhanced intelligence and extended capabilities, is a central theme discussed by the speaker. This significant advancement is largely dependent on the maturation of [[Neurocognitive Technologies and Brain Research | nanotechnology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

## The Concept of Brain-to-Cloud Connection

The speaker envisions a future where human brains are wirelessly connected to the cloud, accessing digital neurons and information as seamlessly as current devices do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:19">[02:02:19]</a>. This connection would allow for immediate access to information, appearing within one's brain as if it were an intrinsic thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>.

## Nanotechnology: The Enabling Factor

[[Neurocognitive Technologies and Brain Research | Nanotechnology]] is defined as an emerging field focused on manipulating materials at the nanometer scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:14">[01:52:14]</a>. One nanometer is one billionth of a meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:03">[01:59:03]</a>. Scientists are actively developing cell-sized nanorobots that will mimic the functions of current robots by collecting data, processing information, taking actions, and communicating at a molecular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:06">[02:03:06]</a>.

### Progression and Timeline
The speaker's research indicates a consistent trend towards a [[Neurocognitive Technologies and Brain Research | nanotechnology]] revolution over the next 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:31">[02:12:31]</a>. This exponential progress is exemplified by the shrinking size and increasing power of computing technology, where a device that once occupied an entire floor now fits into a smartphone, and will soon fit within a blood cell, becoming vastly more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:41">[02:13:41]</a>.

By the 2030s and 2040s, nanobots are predicted to be prevalent in the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:55">[02:19:55]</a>. Their initial roles will include precision medical tasks, such as delivering drugs directly and clearing clogged arteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:02">[02:20:02]</a>. Eventually, these nanobots will non-invasively enter the brain through capillaries, establishing wireless communication between the neocortex (the brain's top layer) and digital neurons hosted in the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:12">[02:20:12]</a>.

### Overcoming Skepticism
The idea of nanobots in the body may initially face resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:55">[02:20:55]</a>. However, the speaker draws a parallel to the initial reluctance to adopt cell phones, which are now ubiquitous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:57">[02:20:57]</a>.

## Implications of Brain-to-Cloud Connection

Connecting brains to the cloud will remove the intelligence limitations imposed by the skull's size, ultimately expanding human intellect million-fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:07">[02:21:07]</a>. This merger of humans and [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | AI]] will blur the lines between biological and digital existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:23">[02:23:23]</a>.

This technological integration is part of the "Singularity," a point, anticipated around 2045, where humans fully connect with [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | AI]] and their intelligence expands million-fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:11">[02:26:11]</a>. This transformation will be so profound and rapid that it's difficult to grasp with current biological understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:30">[02:26:30]</a>.

The connection will free humanity from biological limitations, allowing individuals to choose and change their physical appearance and adapt natural and virtual environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:56">[02:26:56]</a>. This will unlock unimagined creativity and skills, such as visualizing 11-dimensional shapes or speaking all languages, capabilities that [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | AI]] already possesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:14">[02:27:14]</a>. The pace and impact of this technological change will fundamentally transform human life forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:32">[02:27:32]</a>.

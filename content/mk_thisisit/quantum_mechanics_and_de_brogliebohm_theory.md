[[Quantum mechanics and its implications | Quantum mechanics]] presents a world where particles can seemingly exist in multiple places at once, and their behavior appears non-deterministic and chaotic, raising questions about how this quantum realm transitions into the order of classical Newtonian physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. A key question is what connects these two realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

## De Broglie's Hypothesis
One of the most profound hypotheses in physics is De Broglie's idea that particles can behave as waves and waves can behave as particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. This concept was later confirmed by numerous physical experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. A persistent question arising from this is how a particle "decides" whether to act as a particle or a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. While physics often attributes this to experimental conditions and environmental interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>, some consider this an unresolved aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

## The De Broglie-Bohm Theory (Pilot-Wave Hypothesis)
The De Broglie-Bohm theory, also known as the pilot-wave hypothesis, offers an interpretation of [[quantum mechanics and waveparticle duality | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. This theory posits:
*   **Existence of the Wave Function** The wave function is a real entity, representing a solution to the Dirac or Schrödinger equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.
*   **Particles and Waves are Distinct** Waves are not particles; particles are distinct, very small, and indivisible entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.
*   **Single Location of Particles** Unlike other interpretations, particles in the De Broglie-Bohm hypothesis exist at only one point in space at any given time, meaning they are not simultaneously in multiple places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
*   **No Wave Function Collapse** The wave function does not "collapse"; it always exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.
*   **Particles "Ride" the Waves** Particles move along these quantum waves, which are derived from the Dirac or Schrödinger equations, much like surfers ride ocean waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. The wave "tells" the particle where to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

### Explaining Quantum Probability and the Double-Slit Experiment
The apparent randomness and probability in [[quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]], particularly in the famous double-slit experiment, can be explained by the De Broglie-Bohm hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

In the double-slit experiment, when light passes through two slits, it creates an interference pattern of multiple stripes on a screen, rather than just two lines as classical intuition would suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. The De Broglie-Bohm hypothesis explains this interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. It suggests that the wave function prepares the conditions for this interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

The probabilistic nature of [[quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] arises from the inherent uncertainty in measuring a particle's initial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. Since no measurement can be made without some tiny error, the exact initial location of a particle cannot be known. This small uncertainty in the initial condition can lead to a large, seemingly chaotic change in the final condition, making it impossible to precisely predict where a particle will land on the interference pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. This leads to the probabilistic description of [[quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

### Contrast with Gravity's Role in Wave Function Collapse
While the speaker supports the De Broglie-Bohm theory, it's worth noting an alternative perspective from Sir Roger Penrose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Penrose, a proponent of the idea that gravity influences [[quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]], suggests that gravity itself causes the collapse of the wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. In his view, the wave function is "curved" by space-time, and stronger gravity leads to faster collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This idea attempts to explain phenomena like Schrödinger's cat, where the superposition of states (dead and alive) is extremely short-lived due to gravitational influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. However, the speaker maintains a belief in space-time being fundamentally classical, without gravitons as carriers of gravity, and views its curvature as a fundamental aspect rather than an effect of averaged gravitons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

The search for meaning is a fundamental human endeavor, described as a "big question" that "hurts a little" for people, unlike artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Professor Krzysztof Zan, a special guest in a Master program at Castel Gandolfo, discusses this lifelong quest and related philosophical inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The Concept of Perfection

The idea of a "perfect number" serves as a metaphor, suggesting perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. While contemporary culture often contests and denies the existence of perfection, Professor Zan notes that perfection is "what drives humanity" for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Although unattainable, striving for perfection is valuable, as "everything can strive for perfection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. A poetic thought from his film suggests that "the perfect number is that in language the singular is worse than the plural," implying that "we are more perfect if we are able to sense it" and develop collectively rather than focusing solely on the "I" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## Science, Reality, and the World Order

Professor Zan's film explores fundamental questions like the World Order, looking for repeatability in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. He emphasizes that science only tracks the World Order, but reality itself is independent of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Even if humanity and its science ceased to exist on Earth, reality would persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

### The Mystery of Creation and [[existence_of_god_and_philosophical_viewpoints | God]]

When asked what decides this World Order if science is secondary, Professor Zan states that the World Order "is already written" and exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. Regarding the creator of this world, his thought process ends there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. He assumes that "what is this unknown is called God," but he has no proof, as science cannot provide it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

Natural regularities, such as the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower or the Fibonacci sequence, are centuries of human observations of "non-obvious regularities in such seemingly trivial things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. The question remains whether these signify something or are merely a "hallucination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. While he would like to believe they are a sign, he acknowledges that "no one obliges me to this faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

## Humanity's Evolution: From Homo Economicus to Homo Technicus

Humanity has evolved significantly, becoming "incredibly dependent on technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. Technology is seen as a blessing, providing comfort and luxury unprecedented in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. Looking ahead, [[challenges_in_understanding_the_origin_of_life_and_physical_constants | genetic engineering]] is anticipated to allow for biological improvements, such as expanding memory and imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. This raises questions about the future of humanity, specifically whether this "Trans man" will still be considered human or "another, better species than us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

Professor Zan considers humans the "best creation of evolution," the "most complicated living organism that exists," with the brain remaining a mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

## Concerns about [[understanding_and_consciousness | Artificial Intelligence]] and [[exploration_of_consciousness_in_relation_to_quantum_mechanics | Consciousness]]

While artificial intelligence has been described as a "powerful statistical machine," Professor Zan expresses fear that it might become "a creature that can gain some [[understanding_and_consciousness | consciousness]], self-awareness and then make decisions in its own interest and not in the interest of its Creator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

The concept of machines experiencing pain is debated. Research suggests complex neural systems might generate pain, but the interface for feeling it doesn't yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Professor Zan states he lacks the expertise to form an opinion on whether such entities should be protected like living organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of humility in the face of such profound questions, advocating for continued research until unequivocal evidence emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.

## The "Civilization of a Full Belly" and Vigilance

Professor Zan, drawing on the ideas of theologian Tomáš Halík, describes contemporary society as a "civilization of a full belly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. Unlike past eras constantly accompanied by hunger, cold, misfortune, and epidemics, modern life "seems safe," fostering "irresponsible impunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. He urges constant vigilance, recognizing that this feeling of safety and a "full belly" is a "fleeting illusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>.

## Life as a Gift and Human Obligation

Life is presented as a gift, not a right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>. His personal experience of surviving war while others died led him to feel he received a "bonus" and a sense of obligation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. This perspective leads him to speak of a "man of obligations" rather than a "man of self-fulfillment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. The fragility of life and plans underscores the need to be prepared for good times to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>.

## The Role of Love

Ultimately, the search for meaning can culminate in love. If a person "immerses himself in some true love, then this meaning is already indisputable," and "he already knows why he lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>.

## Cinema as a Medium for Meaning

As a filmmaker and thinker, Professor Zan believes cinema is a powerful language to discuss profound subjects that are often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>. He states that film can convey what literature traditionally has, using images to explore "great philosophy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>. He aims to use fresh language to tell stories about life, even as he observes a decline in series production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>.

The search for meaning is presented as an inspiring and important journey. Living a life without engaging with these "big questions" means losing a chance, even if it might be "more comfortable" for a moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.

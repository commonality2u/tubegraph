The National Laboratory of Atomic and Molecular Physics in Toruń is engaged in a groundbreaking effort to test [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum physics]] at the atomic and molecular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This research involves developing highly advanced technologies, primarily ultra-precise and ultra-stable lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. The objective is to probe the boundaries of known physics and determine if the standard model of particle physics holds true throughout the observed universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Testing the Standard Model

The work conducted at the laboratory aims to test [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This is distinct from typical high-energy physics experiments. Instead of using extremely high energies, researchers achieve enormous measurement accuracy at relatively low energies, using visible or near-visible light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This approach allows them to examine the standard model from a different perspective, touching on its fundamental principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

The standard model is built upon [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum field theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, which posits that particles are not solid spheres, but rather excitations of quantum fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

### Fundamental Constants

A critical aspect of this research involves examining fundamental constants. The standard model contains approximately 20 dimensionless parameters that are not derived from theory but must be determined experimentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. These constants primarily represent the ratios of elementary particle masses and the strengths of interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

A profound scientific question is whether these fundamental constants remain truly constant over time or space across the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. For instance, the speed of light, while often thought of as a constant, is actually a fixed parameter within the SI unit system used to define the measure of length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. In contrast, dimensionless constants like the fine-structure constant (which defines the strength of electromagnetic interaction) are central to these investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

Current measurements, including those using optical atomic clocks at the Institute of Physics in Toruń, have not detected any changes in these fundamental constants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. Specifically, experiments have shown that the fine-structure constant remains fixed to at least 15 decimal places, significantly advancing previous knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. Discovering any variability in these constants would signify new physics and would likely be awarded a Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

The idea that life as we know it is finely tuned to these constants is an intriguing observation, suggesting that even minimal changes could prevent the formation of complex structures like proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. However, some physicists believe that a more general model, extending beyond the standard model, might eventually predict the values of these constants, thus resolving this "anthropic" mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

## Trapping Molecular Hydrogen

A significant part of the research involves attempting to trap molecular hydrogen, a feat no one has yet achieved on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. Molecular hydrogen is the smallest and simplest neutral molecule found in nature, making it ideal for testing [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum theory]] with high accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>. Just as the hydrogen atom was crucial for much of [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_historical_development | quantum theory's historical development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>, molecular hydrogen can push the boundaries further into molecular physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>.

The challenge lies in molecular hydrogen's extremely weak interaction with electric and magnetic fields, rendering conventional laser cooling and trapping techniques ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>. To overcome this, the researchers are developing cutting-edge experimental technologies at the physical border of what is possible, including generating an ultra-strong laser field within an optical cavity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>. This cavity traps photons, allowing the average optical power to reach megawatt levels, which will enable the trapping of molecular hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>. The system operates at extremely low temperatures, around 4 Kelvin, in a cryogenic vacuum chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>.

If successful, this will open the way for applying a cascade of technologies from cold atom and molecule physics to molecular hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. The goal is to perfectly isolate the quantum system from the environment to allow for extremely precise measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>. The cost of this basic installation is approximately 20 million zlotys (around 2 million Euros from a European grant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>.

## Quantum to Classical Transition and the Observer Effect

One of the most profound questions in modern physics is how the transition from the quantum world to the classical world occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. In the quantum world, objects can exist in superpositions of states – for example, a photon can be in a state where its location is unknown until measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. This probabilistic description is natural in [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. However, in the classical world, one outcome is realized. The theory of decoherence, championed by Professor Żurek, addresses how this transition happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:03]</a>.

Regarding the "observer effect," in [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]], some believe that human consciousness affects experimental outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. However, from the perspective of an experimental physicist, the presence of a conscious observer has "absolutely no significance" on the physical result of an experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:00]</a>. The act of measurement (e.g., using photons) is what causes the wave function to collapse and a definite outcome to be realized, regardless of whether a human or an automaton performs the observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:32:00">[27:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>.

## The Nature of Reality and Cognition

The very nature of reality, as described by [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum theory]], presents profound questions. For instance, the vacuum is not truly empty space but is permeated by oscillating quantum fields, giving rise to virtual particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>. A hydrogen molecule can "feel" these zero oscillations of the vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>.

There's also the question of whether all problems are "cognitively accessible" to human understanding, given the limitations of our three-dimensional perception and senses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:00">[29:30:00]</a>.

A fundamental breakthrough in science was the realization that our description of reality must be consistent with reality itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:00">[40:00:00]</a>. This principle, understood around the time of Newton and Galileo, is the cornerstone of scientific inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24:00">[40:24:00]</a>. Questions that cannot be confronted with reality, like "Does mathematics exist?" (since it is an idea, not a tangible object), are considered poorly posed in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:32:00">[39:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:57:00">[40:57:00]</a>.

## Future of Atomic Physics and Consciousness

In the coming years, a major goal in atomic physics is to reveal the limits of the standard model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:41:00">[32:41:00]</a>. This could involve finding that it doesn't work in certain "corners" or determining if elementary particles like the electron have an electric dipole moment, which would indicate a slight non-sphericity contrary to the current model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:50:00">[32:50:00]</a>.

A particularly intriguing question for physicists is how consciousness arises from the standard model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:32:00">[42:32:00]</a>. Despite understanding the mechanistic nature of physical reality and the workings of classical and [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum computers]], there's no clear idea how the subjective experience of consciousness emerges from the actions of neural networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:30:00">[43:30:00]</a>. While some, like Professor Penrose, discuss quantum effects in the brain's microtubules, this is still a mechanistic description, not an explanation of subjectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:45:00">[43:45:00]</a>. It remains an open question whether consciousness is fully explainable by the known standard model or if it requires another piece of physics or reality not yet understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:14:00">[45:14:00]</a>.

Our ancestors would consider us "sorcerers" who can create images out of nothing and communicate instantly with the whole world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The world of the future is predicted to be similar to the mythical world of the gods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Predictions for the Future

It is difficult to predict what the world will look like in 2050 in a constantly changing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. However, reasonable assumptions can be made based on the directions of development in physics and chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Our great-great-great-great-grandchildren may live in a world where they can control life, matter, and energy, which is currently impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. What we consider magic or voodoo today may be the reality for our great-grandchildren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### The Role of Technology

[[Technological advancements and societal impact | Technology]] has given us the opportunity to communicate and share knowledge, largely due to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. Progress has a direction towards democratization and sharing the fruits of [[impact_of_technology_on_human_society | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

## Immortality

There are two main types of immortality discussed:

### Digital Immortality

Digital immortality involves creating a mechanical clone of oneself with most memories and thought patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. The first generation of digitally immortal people already exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. For example, William Shatner, known from *Star Trek*, created an image of himself through extensive interviews that will "live forever" and allow conversations with future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This form of immortality, though primitive today, is possible to implement and allows thoughts to be preserved forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### Organic Immortality

Organic immortality allows the physical body to live forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
Solutions proposed include:
*   **Digitizing the Brain**: It is possible to digitize the brain itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. While disassembling an insect brain (100,000 neurons) has been achieved, digitizing the human brain (100 billion neurons) is considered only a matter of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. This is essentially transferring the brain to a computer or vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This process will take centuries but is deemed possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   **Replacing Organs**: Inventing organic immortality could mean replacing used organs with new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Quantum Computing and [[Artificial intelligence progress and future | AI]]

Computers in the future will be quantum, making them millions of times more powerful than today's computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This will enable [[Artificial intelligence progress and future | artificial intelligence]] to become a reality and a norm in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Today's computers are Newtonian, operating on binary (zeros and ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Quantum computers, however, work in the world of quantum mechanics, with infinite states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. While current quantum computers are not universal and can only work on one problem at a time, they are millions of times more powerful than digital computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. The future is quantum computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

The human brain is believed to be partially quantum, and quantum computers already exist that operate somewhat similarly to a quantum brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Human Evolution and Space Colonization

In 100 years, descendants may live like Greek gods, able to manipulate matter, energy, and life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This includes manipulating the human genome, not just one gene, but the entire genome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Instead of adapting planets like Mars to human needs, humanity may be able to modify itself to survive in different universal environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### Superhumans and Colonization

There is progress in connecting the human brain to external devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This has allowed paralyzed individuals to control exoskeletons with their thoughts, as demonstrated at the Olympic Games in Sao Paulo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

In the future, this could lead to giving humans super abilities, like creating or moving things available only to robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. These "superhumans" could potentially colonize Mars and the universe thanks to their enhanced capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. This improved version of humanity could be possible within 100 to 1000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

Digital self-digitization, saving thought patterns into software, and launching it into space for connection with an exoskeleton upon arrival on a celestial body is a theoretical method for space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Similarly, launching exoskeletons with consciousness onboard could enable universal discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

## Conscious Machines

The possibility of creating a conscious machine depends on the definition of consciousness, for which there is currently no single theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. However, it is believed that a machine could be created that knows its location, understands its position in the universe, and can interact with humans and other beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

## Future Civilizations (Kardashev Scale)

Physicists analyze space for clues about alien civilizations, categorizing them into types:
*   **Type 1 Civilization**: Masters all the energy of its planet, controlling everything from sunlight to earthquakes and volcanoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. Such civilizations can only colonize a few planets in their solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.
*   **Type 2 Civilization**: Uses the power of its planet and its sun, controlling all solar energy to power machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. The Federation of Planets from *Star Trek* would be an example of a Type 2 civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.
*   **Type 3 Civilization**: Has a galactic character, traveling galactic routes and even interacting with black holes, akin to *Star Wars* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. A Type 3 civilization may have access to Plank energy, which is the greatest energy in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Plank energy can destabilize space, creating space-time anomalies or "bubbles" (space-time foam, formulated by Stephen Hawking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. The Big Bang itself could have been a bubble reaching Plank energy and expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. A Type 3 civilization might use this as a gateway for space travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.

### Threats to Civilizations

Civilizations tend to self-destruct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. For Type 1 civilizations, four scenarios for self-destruction are identified: nuclear weapons, biological weapons, global warming, and [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | Artificial intelligence]], possessing the power of all human technologies, could lead to self-destruction if used for the wrong purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

## Time and the Future

Theoretically, a time machine could be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. While time seems to flow in one direction, Einstein suggested it is dynamic, like a river with eddies that can fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. Stephen Hawking theorized that through time-space tunnels, one might travel into the future but not necessarily the past, due to the risk of energy accumulation and explosion if a loop is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. However, a loophole exists if universes do not explode upon repeated trips, making past travel possible with a significant amount of energy, like Plank energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

## Optimism for Progress

Despite historical patterns of disasters and wars, viewing history in terms of centuries reveals "incredible progress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. History has a clear direction towards democratization and the dissemination of [[technological_advancements_and_societal_impact | technology]] that can free humanity from hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. This progress is uneven but undeniable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

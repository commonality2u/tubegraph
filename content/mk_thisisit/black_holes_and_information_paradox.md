[[understanding_black_holes_and_their_role_in_the_universe | Black holes]] are regions in [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>. They are limited on one side by a membrane called the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. The properties of this membrane dictate that while everything inside can fall in, including light, nothing, not even light or information, can fall out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. An observer outside the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | event horizon]] has no insight into what is happening inside and never will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>.

## The Information Problem

Initially, studies suggested that what enters a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] is not only completely mixed but also erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. This implies that a given object would be torn apart in the center of the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

However, a fundamental principle of nature is that information is conserved, meaning it cannot be destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:48">[03:48:48]</a>. For example, if a book is set on fire, all its components (light, heat, atoms, photons, smoke) can theoretically be perfectly measured to rebuild the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:57">[03:57:57]</a>. This contradicts the idea of information being erased by a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]], leading to the [[information_paradox_and_singularities_in_black_holes | information paradox]].

The central question is: What happens to the information (energy, matter) that falls into a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] during its evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:51">[04:51:51]</a>?

## Hawking Radiation and its Implications

[[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | Black holes]] have their own lifespan and will eventually evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:18">[04:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:20">[04:20:20]</a>. This process is due to [[Steven Hawking | Steven Hawking's]] discovery called [[Hawking radiation | Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:23">[04:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:47">[06:47:47]</a>.

[[Hawking radiation | Hawking radiation]] comes from the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | event horizon]] of a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]], which is described as pure [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | spacetime]] â€“ simply the geometry of [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:33">[02:33:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:43">[02:43:43]</a>. It is almost as if the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] vibrates or tears this radiation from the vacuum of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:51">[02:51:51]</a>. Since the radiation comes from the vacuum and not from the matter that fell in, the problem arises: how is it possible that what fell in is finally recorded in the radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:16">[03:16:16]</a>?

## Reconciling the Paradox

### Information Exit

The current opinion is that information does come out again, albeit in a very mixed way, recorded in the radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>. However, [[Steven Hawking | Steven Hawking's]] initial calculations denied this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:10">[02:10:10]</a>, suggesting there might have been something wrong with those calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:15">[02:15:15]</a>.

### Hawking's Quantum Mechanics Attempt

In the 1970s, [[Steven Hawking | Steven Hawking]] attempted to reconcile [[quantum mechanics | quantum mechanics]] with the theory of gravity, despite the lack of a quantum theory of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:10">[07:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:14">[07:14:14]</a>. He made calculations involving quantum mechanical particles on and near the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | event horizon]] of the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:27">[07:27:27]</a>.

[[Hawking radiation | Hawking's]] method was related to "pair creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:41">[07:41:41]</a>. Quantum theory suggests that at sufficiently high energies, a particle and its antiparticle can be created simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:44">[07:44:44]</a>. If this occurs near the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole's]] [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | event horizon]], it's possible that the antiparticle falls into the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] while the particle escapes to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:56">[07:56:56]</a>.

### Wormholes

A very speculative interpretation involves a kind of [[black_holes_wormholes_and_the_information_paradox | wormholes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:48">[09:47:48]</a>, different from those [[black_holes_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein talked about]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:51">[09:51:51]</a>. These hypothetical [[black_holes_wormholes_and_the_information_paradox | wormholes]] could open from the inside of the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] to the outside, allowing information to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:55">[09:55:55]</a>.

The idea of the [[Einstein-Rosen bridge | Einstein-Rosen bridge]] and [[black_holes_wormholes_and_the_information_paradox | wormhole]] comes from [[Albert Einstein | Einstein]] and Rosen's work in the mid-1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:07">[11:07:07]</a>. This is a property of [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | spacetime]] in mathematical solutions describing "eternal [[black_holes_and_universe_creation | black holes]]" (a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] that has always existed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:29">[11:29:29]</a>. These solutions include a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]], a white hole, and a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | spacetime]] tunnel connecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:38">[11:38:38]</a>.

However, it's not possible to pass through these [[black_holes_wormholes_and_the_information_paradox | wormholes]] because of how they develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:46">[11:46:46]</a>. Constructing a stable [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | spacetime]] tunnel through which one could travel would require forms of energy or matter that, according to current knowledge, do not exist in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

Some physicists agree that two documents published by [[Albert Einstein | Einstein]] (one known as the [[Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox | Einstein-Podolsky]] document, the other as [[Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox | IP]]) describe the same phenomenon: a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | spacetime]] tunnel created by the merging of two completely entangled [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:24">[12:24:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:31">[12:31:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:42">[12:42:42]</a>. While theoretically they *can* exist, stable traversable tunnels probably do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:05">[13:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:10">[13:10:10]</a>. It's difficult to maintain the stability of such a tunnel to allow for exit on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:37">[13:37:37]</a>.

## Singularities and the Cosmic Censor

The collapse of matter into a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | black hole]] is described by the concept of "dust collapse," where material without pressure collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:30">[08:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:39">[08:39:39]</a>. If this collapse is perfectly spherically symmetrical, everything falls towards the center, creating a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]] of infinite density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:47">[08:47:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:03">[09:03:03]</a>.

This leads to the "Cosmic Censor Hypothesis," which posits that all [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularities]] must be hidden inside the [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:53">[13:53:53]</a>. This means a "cosmic censor" forbids insight into the nature of [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:08">[14:08:08]</a>. However, whether there *must* always be a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | horizon]] surrounding a [[concepts_of_black_holes_and_singularity | singularity]] is an open and mathematically interesting problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:15">[14:15:15]</a>.

## Significance of Understanding Black Holes

Understanding [[understanding_black_holes_and_their_role_in the_universe | black holes]] is crucial for making a "quantum leap" in understanding science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>, particularly theoretical physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:34">[14:34:34]</a>. The existence of [[black_holes_and_their_mysteries | black holes]] also proves that the general theory of [[black_holes_and_einsteins_theory_of_relativity | relativity]] itself breaks down at certain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:23">[03:23:23]</a>.

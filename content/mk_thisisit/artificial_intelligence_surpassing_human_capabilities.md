It is becoming increasingly difficult to identify tests where humans demonstrably outperform machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In many domains, [[human vs machine intelligence | artificial intelligence]] (AI) has already surpassed or shows strong potential to surpass [[human vs machine intelligence | human capabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Current Superiority of AI

### Medical Field
Studies involving [[Artificial intelligence and societal impact | AI]] chatbots like GPT-4 on medical topics have shown that the AI significantly outperformed groups of doctors in both the quality of advice given and empathy towards patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Most doctors were found to be very weak or lacking in empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. The expectation is that these systems could relieve human professionals, allowing them to focus on areas currently overburdened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### Programming
While complex systems requiring human-client communication may still favor humans, in programming itself, AI is proving to be faster, better, and capable of correcting human mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Programmers now frequently consult AI systems to verify their code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Image Recognition and Emotional Interpretation
AI systems now demonstrate superior [[comparison of ai and human intelligence | image recognition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Furthermore, AI is better at interpreting emotional states based on video recordings, even teaching humans about their own emotions, which is described as "completely surprising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

### Understanding Animal Communication
Professor Włodzisław Duch states that [[strong artificial intelligence will finally help us understand animals | strong artificial intelligence]] will eventually help humanity understand animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Efforts are underway to analyze sounds made by whales in their songs or dolphins' squeaks to detect symbols and understand their communication's meaning by relating them to their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. The goal is to eventually communicate with animals in their own language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This capability of AI to "rebuild bridges" extends even to animal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## Evolving Capabilities of AI

### AI Creativity and "Temperature"
AI systems regulate their creativity through a parameter known as "temperature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This parameter determines how much the AI can deviate from learned patterns, allowing it to generate new, varied, and even "confabulated" responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. High temperature allows for more distant associations and fantasizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This concept is analogous to neuronal noise in the human brain, which causes human responses to vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Stanisław Lem's Predictions and AI Reality
Stanisław Lem, a Polish writer, was notably skeptical about [[artificial intelligence progress and future | AI progress]] in his time, particularly regarding machines developing consciousness or genuine thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. He distinguished between "intelligence" (e.g., chess-playing) and "reason," linking reason to consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. However, two decades later, [[Artificial intelligence and future prospects | AI capabilities]] have surprised everyone, including Lem himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The belief that machines couldn't think or possess a "spark of intelligence" has not come true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Lem also speculated on the idea that information could be the basis of matter and the universe, a concept now considered by physicists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. While some of his predictions proved highly visionary, he himself was critical of his ability to be a visionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### AI as a Tool User
Unlike the human brain, which has specialized structures for different functions, AI systems often have a single, massive network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. However, [[future of artificial intelligence | AI]] can use various tools, potentially more widely than humans, by integrating different sensors (e.g., infrared, ultrasound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### AI in Robotics
Recent advancements show huge [[future of artificial intelligence | progress in robotics]] through the integration of robotics and [[Artificial Intelligence and its future implications | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Robots are now equipped with speech analysis and discussion capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

One notable example is the Boston Dynamics "Spot" robot dog. When asked about its parents, it led to a room with old robots and stated, "This is his line of ancestors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. This surprised its creators as nothing like it was programmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This indicates that current AI systems are not merely repeating learned information but are creative, generating new statements based on their perceptions and internal neural network states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. They operate as open systems, not subject to the limitations of classical symbolic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

### Abstraction and Internal States in Robots
AI systems are moving to higher levels of abstraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. For instance, a robot shown many animals it has learned to recognize, when asked to "look for a dinosaur," can infer it's an animal and choose a unique, previously unknown one, identifying it as a dinosaur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

Moreover, extensive cooperation among institutions has led to collecting information about the internal states of robots. This allows for improving robot operation in the world, including real-time systems (RTX) that enable robots to understand their own body, distance, and regulate forces, akin to human internal sensations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. This internalizing of sensations will drive significant progress in robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

## [[Limitations of artificial intelligence | Addressing Challenges]] and Future Prospects
AI is also expected to help filter the overwhelming amount of information on the internet, which Lem noted was a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. It can also assist with education, serving as an "ethical system" to protect humans from their own "stupidity," as Lem once described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

The future of [[superintelligence in artificial intelligence | AI]] is not necessarily terrible; it is likely that [[future of artificial intelligence | AI]] can be harnessed to create a more human-friendly environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. The most surprising recent development in [[artificial intelligence development | AI development]] has been the release of GPT chat, which allowed for natural conversation and rapid expansion into hundreds of languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

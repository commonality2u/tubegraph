The Lewmo system is a pioneering levitating railway technology developed by the Polish company newmo. It represents a unique approach to high-speed rail, particularly in its ability to integrate with [[integration_with_existing_railway_infrastructure | existing railway infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The technology, including its integration method, is patented and considered unique globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. newmo positions itself as a "Polish answer" or "European answer" to the "Chinese attack" in the railway sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## How it Works

The core of the Lewmo system is passive levitation technology, allowing the train to float a few centimeters above the tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This creates a magnetic cushion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The system operates on a physical phenomenon similar to a magnet slowing down when falling through a tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The vertical levitation force, which lifts the vehicle, is a side effect of the vehicle's movement over the infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Components
The system consists of:
*   **Permanent Magnets** installed on the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Levitation Beam** (also called a levitation table), which is an additional element added to the track infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This beam has a main structural element and aluminum plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. When the magnets move over the aluminum plate, the levitation force appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Linear Drive**, a key component of the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

This technology allows newmo to adapt to current railway infrastructure without needing to invest in traditional rails or sleepers, provided the existing infrastructure allows for modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. However, new rolling stock or vehicles are required for the levitation technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Performance and Speed

The target speed for the Lewmo system is up to 550 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, or up to 500 km/h ultimately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. While 550 km/h is achievable on straight lines or very long curves, it is unrealistic on tight curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The system can increase speed in curves by up to 40% compared to traditional rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. A journey on the Kraków-Gdańsk route (approximately 700 km) would take a little over an hour to an hour and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

## Safety and Operation

Safety is paramount in railway operations, dictating every process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. For high speeds, safety measures include:
*   **Infrastructural Separation**: High-speed lines are separated from the rest of the network, preventing issues like single-level road-railway intersections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Access Control**: Physical separation, such as fences, prevents access for outsiders and wild animals, as collisions at high speeds are disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Traffic Control**: The idea is to gradually implement the system, initially separating periods in timetables for levitating vehicles, and later transitioning to full mixed traffic with collision-free movement and detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Passenger Comfort**: Railway regulations dictate acceptable acceleration levels for passenger comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. While trains typically move slower due to comfort, dedicated trains using Lewmo can incorporate solutions like those in airplanes (deep seats, side support, seat belts) to improve comfort during acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. The system is designed to be absolutely safe, possibly even safer than current railways, due to full automation and exclusion of the human factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

## Development and Costs

The idea for the levitating railway originated from a student team that participated in the Hyperloop competition, achieving a top 10 result among hundreds of participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. They recognized the high costs and separation issues of Hyperloop and Maglev systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The inspiration was to apply elements of Hyperloop technology to existing railway infrastructure, leveraging existing transport corridors and connections to city centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

newmo has developed a prototype and an existing test track in Nowa Sarzyna, Podkarpacie region, Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The track is 720m long and fully functional conventional infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. A small 50-meter proof-of-concept prototype was first presented in Warsaw in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. The recent demonstration of the levitating train on existing infrastructure was the result of a three-year project, which cost 16.5 million zlotys (awarded by NCBIR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

The estimated cost for implementing the passenger transport revolution on a route like Kraków-Gdańsk (approx. 700 km) is about 500 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. This is significantly less than building new high-speed rail infrastructure like Shinkansen, which costs between 50 and 150 million dollars per kilometer, potentially running into tens of billions for the same route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.

The company estimates that passenger pilots will be ready around 2028, but actual operation with passengers is projected for 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. This extended timeline is largely due to the highly regulated railway sector, where authorization processes for new technologies can take 5-10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

## Future and Impact

The Lewmo system aims to reduce travel time, especially when accounting for the entire journey from home to destination, by offering city-center to city-center travel, avoiding the time and cost associated with getting to airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. Tickets are also expected to be cheaper due to lower operating costs compared to air travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. This aligns with a broader European push for greener transport and increased capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>.

While passenger transport is a long-term goal, the company has also developed a product for freight transport called "Il Buster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. This system allows for automatic transport of independent freight wagons using a linear drive mounted in the infrastructure, without levitation. It significantly increases throughput and profitability for freight transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.

newmo sees itself as a "European chance for the revitalization of transport" on the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>. The company cooperates with the three largest infrastructure managers in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>, highlighting the [[potential_for_revolutionizing_rail_transport_in_Europe | potential for revolutionizing rail transport in Europe]].

## Team

The newmo team began seven years ago as a small group of 5-7 student engineers who founded the company and built the initial demonstrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. The team has since expanded to about 60 people, including engineers in Poland, Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. They also have strong support from experts in the railway sector, including an advisor who managed the construction of the Transrapid in Shanghai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

The universe is observed to be expanding, and this expansion is accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. In popular scientific discourse, this accelerating expansion is referred to as [[dark_energy_and_its_implications | dark energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. In physics, this [[dark_energy_and_its_implications | dark energy]] is termed the [[cosmological_constant_and_dark_energy | cosmic constant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

## Characteristics of the Cosmological Constant

The effect of the [[cosmological_constant_and_dark_energy | cosmic constant]] is primarily observed at the edges of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. The diameter of the universe is approximately 100 billion light-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. At such vast distances, it is possible to precisely measure the acceleration of the universe's expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>, which is attributed to [[dark_energy_and_its_implications | dark energy]] or the [[cosmological_constant_and_dark_energy | cosmological constant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. This [[cosmological_constant_and_dark_energy | constant]] is known to be very small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

## Theoretical Connections

There is another very small constant in physics, the Planck constant, which describes how quantum effects become dominant over classical ones at the scale of a hydrogen atom (10<sup>-10</sup> meters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. An idea has been put forth that the existence of the [[cosmological_constant_and_dark_energy | cosmological constant]] at the universe's edges should modify the Swinger equation at the level of the hydrogen atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. This is considered a "pretty crazy idea" because it suggests that phenomena at the universe's edge could influence elementary particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. However, from a mathematical perspective, the Scher equation does incorporate gravitational effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. A hypothesis and calculation within twistor theory support this idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

## Boundaries of the Universe

From a scientific standpoint, asking "what is beyond the edges of the universe" does not make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. What is defined as the universe is space-time itself, meaning space and time only exist within its boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. Therefore, questions about "what was before the Big Bang" or "what is beyond the universe" are considered fascinating but not scientific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

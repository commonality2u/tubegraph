The world we experience daily is composed of large objects, which we term the "classical world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. However, all matter is fundamentally built from smaller objects, eventually reaching the level of atoms and elementary particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These microscopic constituents exist in a "quantum world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> that operates completely differently from our familiar macroscopic reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Understanding the Quantum World
Atoms are infinitesimally small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The sheer number of atoms in a human body is described as "terrifying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Due to their minute size, atoms do not behave like everyday objects such as trams or ping-pong balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>; they inhabit an "alien" world that we have not experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

[[Quantum mechanics and its implications | Quantum mechanics]] is defined as a theory of our observations of this microworld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. All scientific theories are considered valid if they align with our observations, whether sensory or extended through experimental devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. A key distinction of the quantum world is that the act of observation profoundly changes our knowledge, and often the state, of the observed object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. For instance, the photons used to observe quantum phenomena can disrupt what is being viewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This is unlike observing macroscopic objects, where the act of observation has a negligible effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Quantum Teleportation
Within the microworld, [[teleportation]] can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, [[teleportation]] is not a natural phenomenon; it is an artificial process, much like a telephone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. It is crucial to understand that [[teleportation]] does not involve the transfer of matter; instead, it is the transfer of a "soul" or state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. For [[teleportation]] to work, an object in the target location must already be present to receive the transformed state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

While elementary particles can be teleported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, teleporting a more complex object like a human being is considered beyond the technical capabilities of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This is because such a process would require an infinitely dimensional Bell measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>, demanding resources probably equivalent to the entire universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>. For example, teleporting a glass of atoms would require capturing an astronomically large number of possible Bell states, roughly (10^26)^2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Nobel Prize and Quantum Information
The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics, which honored pioneering experiments in quantum information, including [[teleportation]], recognized studies on [[quantum entanglement and spacetime tunnels | entangled]] states that demonstrate the violation of Bell's inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

One significant achievement in this field, stemming from collaborations in the early 1990s, involved demonstrating that photons emitted independently from distinct but similar sources could be forced to interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. This breakthrough in understanding how to manipulate quantum states led to the possibility of "entanglement exchange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>, where separate entangled photons become fully entangled through an experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

A famous photograph from 1994, known as "the most beautiful photo in the history of physics," illustrates parametrically converted photons that are entangled by polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. This phenomenon, where photon pairs jump out of a crystal, shows perfect symmetry: if a green photon appears at one point, its "brother" will appear at a symmetrical location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. This additional property of parametric conversion was discovered and subsequently utilized for [[teleportation]] experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.

## Implications and Broader Context
[[Quantum entanglement and its significance | Entanglement]] is not just a theoretical concept; it occurs ubiquitously in nature. Even the basic state of the simplest atom, hydrogen (consisting of a proton and an electron), is an entangled state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

The development of quantum theories has often faced skepticism. For instance, Bell's theorem, which highlights the fundamental gap between phenomena explainable by classical mechanics (plus relativity) and those explainable by [[Quantum mechanics and its implications | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>, was initially met with resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. Despite being told not to pursue it because "everything has already been done," the profound intellectual shock of the theory motivated continued research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. Later, the work on Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) correlations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a> demonstrated that with three or more observers and particles, phenomena become so "mad" that any interference observed is inherently quantum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

While these advanced concepts of [[quantum entanglement and its significance | entanglement]] enhance our understanding of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a> and the early universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, they do not necessarily bring us closer to answering metaphysical questions like "what was before the Big Bang?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a> or "why do the laws of physics exist?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. From an atheistic perspective, the existence of life and civilization is seen as a series of fortunate coincidences within the vastness of the cosmos, rather than a predetermined necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.

The progress in [[quantum physics and consciousness | quantum physics]] continues to reveal the counter-intuitive and complex nature of reality at its most fundamental level.

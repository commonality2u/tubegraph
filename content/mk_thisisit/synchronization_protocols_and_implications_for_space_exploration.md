Synchronization of time is crucial for modern technology, ranging from financial transactions to advanced scientific experiments and the burgeoning field of space industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. New instruments and protocols developed in Poland are at the forefront of this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The "White Rabbit" Protocol

In Poland, a significant synchronization protocol called "White Rabbit" was developed by two engineers, Tomek Włostowski and Grzesiek Daniel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. This protocol has gained international recognition, impressing scientists worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. It is currently employed in various critical sectors:
*   **Financial sector** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>
*   **Energy sector** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>
*   **Scientific research** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>
*   It is also a candidate for synchronizing [[potential_applications_of_time_crystals_in_quantum_computing | quantum cryptography]] solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

The "White Rabbit" protocol demonstrated its robustness when it was used to verify an experiment at CERN involving neutrinos, which initially appeared to travel faster than light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Although the faster-than-light measurement was later identified as a technical error in optical fiber length calculation, the protocol itself performed as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## [[role_and_technology_of_atomic_clocks | Atomic Clocks]] and Their Importance

[[role_and_technology_of_atomic_clocks | Atomic clocks]] are fundamental to precise time measurement because they function consistently regardless of geographical location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Before their invention, timekeeping relied on astronomical observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### How Atomic Clocks Work
[[role_and_technology_of_atomic_clocks | Atomic clocks]] count the excitations of atoms, which vibrate with extreme regularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The most precise [[role_and_technology_of_atomic_clocks | atomic clocks]], known as cesium fountains, operate in a vacuum and are cooled to ultra-cold temperatures, which slows down atomic movement, enhancing precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

Historically, the production of [[role_and_technology_of_atomic_clocks | atomic clocks]] was largely limited to the United States and China due to their "dual-use product" classification, signifying high technology with both civilian and military applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

## [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | Spacetime]] and Time Dilation

The [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | concept of spacetime]] dictates that time is not absolute but is influenced by gravity and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. This phenomenon is known as time dilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

[!NOTE|Time Dilation]
"Time flows differently on earth differently in outer space. It depends on gravity, i.e. on the size of astral objects, but also on the speed and direction with which we move." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>

For example, time flows slightly faster at the top of Mount Everest than at sea level due to weaker gravitational pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This means a person on Mount Everest would age marginally faster than someone at sea level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This effect, predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity, is a daily reality for technologies like GPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

## GPS and Time Synchronization

The Global Positioning System (GPS) relies heavily on precise time synchronization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. GPS satellites orbit approximately 20,000 km above Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Due to relativistic effects:
*   Their speed causes time on board the satellites to flow faster (a few milliseconds per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   The weaker gravitational pull at their altitude also causes time to flow faster (42 microseconds per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

These combined effects result in a difference of approximately 35 microseconds per day that GPS systems must correct to ensure accurate positioning on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

### GPS Vulnerabilities
GPS systems are susceptible to "spoofing," where false signals can be transmitted from the ground or even from satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. While military GPS signals have cryptographic protection, civilian signals are more easily encoded and mimicked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Older GPS receivers were not designed to distinguish between original and false signals, making them vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. Local GPS disruptions have been observed to affect financial transactions for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

## Timekeeping for [[cooperation_with_nasa_and_space_exploration | Space Industrialization]]

The push towards [[cooperation_with_nasa_and_space_exploration | space industrialization]] necessitates standardized time scales beyond Earth's Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. While UTC is based on [[role_and_technology_of_atomic_clocks | atomic clocks]] and includes leap seconds to align with Earth's rotation, it poses challenges for technology due to its irregular additions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

As industrial automation extends to the Moon and Mars, a common "orchestra conductor" — time — is needed for seamless operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Communication delays (e.g., 1 second from Earth to Moon) require the creation of autonomous lunar time scales that can be integrated with Earth-based systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. This may involve building independent satellite systems around the Moon for time correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## The Sagnac Interferometer

A highly sensitive device, the Sagnac interferometer, is being developed in Poland to examine our position relative to [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

### How it Works
This device uses an optical fiber to release light in two opposite directions, which then collides and interferes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. This interference pattern reveals the device's position relative to [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | spacetime]] itself, not just Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Each rotation change of the device, across its three axes, precisely determines its position relative to [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

### Applications
The Sagnac interferometer operates with astonishing accuracy, registering position changes with the precision of a helium atom's nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. Its capabilities extend to:
*   **Seismology**: It can register minute vibrations, such as the steps of tourists walking four floors above a sensor buried 100 meters under solid rock in Książ Castle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   **Geological Exploration**: It can be used for non-invasive searches for deposits of gas or thermal waters by analyzing ground vibrations caused by controlled impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

The interferometer serves as a crucial tool for validating that space is not an "ether" but possesses specific properties that affect time and position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Its ability to navigate in [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | space]] based on its interaction with [[concept_of_spacetime_and_time_travel | spacetime]] has significant implications for future space travel and exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

The idea of being visited by [[existence_of_intelligent_life_forms | intelligent life forms]] from other parts of the universe is considered a possible logical scenario, not a crazy one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, its likelihood is deemed so remote that it is not taken seriously by some physicists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>.

## Likelihood of Extraterrestrial Life and Visitation

It is believed that [[existence_of_intelligent_life_forms | intelligent life forms]] exist in the universe and that humanity is not alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. The development of life on Earth took billions of years, with the final emergence of [[existence_of_intelligent_life_forms | intelligent life]] taking another billion years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Therefore, any other planets with living systems would likely be either billions of years behind or ahead of Earth in their development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. A coincidence where an extraterrestrial civilization is at the same stage of evolution as humanity would be extremely unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

If these civilizations are billions of years behind, they would not possess the technology for interstellar travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. If they are billions of years ahead, they might not be interested in visiting Earth, viewing humanity as "tiny ants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. The notion that advanced civilizations would "drift trying to avoid detection" is considered anthropomorphic and ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. If such an advanced civilization wished to remain hidden, humanity's primitive detection equipment would be insufficient to find them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## [[scientific_skepticism_about_ufo_sightings | Scientific Skepticism About UFO Sightings]] and Evidence

A theoretical physicist suggests looking for solid, verifiable evidence to separate facts from optimistic speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Approximately 95% of [[ufo_observations | UFO observations]] are suitable for rejection, but about 5% are considered "hair-raising" due to observations made by multiple witnesses using different technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

However, the "gold standard" for proving [[life_beyond_earth_and_the_search_for_extraterrestrial_life | intelligent life in the universe]] requires more than observing "flying saucers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. There is a vast number of [[ufo_observations | observations]] without [[scientific_evidence_of_alien_technology | tangible evidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. No one has yet found [[scientific_evidence_of_alien_technology | alien technology]] or captured an alien <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. Individuals who claim abduction are encouraged to bring back [[scientific_evidence_of_alien_technology | tangible evidence]], such as a piece of a spaceship or a tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

### Claims of Crashed Vehicles

In June 2023, military intelligence officer David Grusch claimed that the Pentagon has a secret program to recover crashed vehicles of non-human origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. He further stated that there were contacts with "flying saucers," and that accidents occurred and bodies were examined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. However, when questioned by Congress about hard evidence of [[scientific_evidence_of_alien_technology | alien technology]] or bodies, Grusch testified he had none, only having spoken to people who claimed to have seen them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. This lack of hard, repeatable evidence from multiple observations using different methods means the "gold standard" has not been met for confirming contact with a technologically advanced civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.

## [[cultural_and_psychological_factors_in_belief_in_aliens | Cultural and Psychological Factors in Belief in Aliens]]

Many people desire reality to possess a deeper dimension beyond superficial experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. This longing stems from a desire to have a greater influence on the universe, feel a deeper connection, and for their lives to have more meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. This can push people to take unusual phenomena seriously, as these beliefs reinforce the idea of being chosen or having access to a profound truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.

It is suggested that if people understood [[role_of_science_in_understanding_extraterrestrial_phenomena | science]] better, they would find that quantum mechanics itself is "magical enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. The strangeness and extraordinariness of quantum mechanics, supported by experimental evidence, are considered more intriguing and satisfying than ideas like channeling or alien visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. The true wonders of [[role_of_science_in_understanding_extraterrestrial_phenomena | science]] could enchant people more than fanciful imaginations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

## [[possibility_of_faster_than_light_speed | Mechanisms of Interstellar Travel]]

Currently, [[possibility_of_faster_than_light_speed | faster-than-light ships]] are not believed to be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. However, two types of warp drives are conceptually distinguished:
*   **Alcubierre Drive**: This involves bending spacetime to create a shortcut, consistent with Einstein's theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. Physicist Miguel Alcubierre discovered a solution to equations that would allow [[possibility_of_faster_than_light_speed | faster-than-light movement]] by bending spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
*   **Wormhole**: This involves cutting a "hole" in spacetime to create a shortcut between two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.

The primary obstacle to building such drives is the immense energy requirement, specifically Planck energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. Planck energy is about 10^19 billion electron volts, far beyond the maximum of trillions of electron volts reached by current particle accelerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. This level of energy is characteristic of Type III civilizations, which hypothetically could bend spacetime and potentially build a time machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. Humanity is currently considered a Type Zero civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

While keeping an open mind about the existence of aliens is encouraged, hard evidence is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. Claims of advanced civilizations conquering galaxies require verifiable proof that is currently lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

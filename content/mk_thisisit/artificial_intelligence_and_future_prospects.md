The emergence of General Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) and the broader field of [[artificial_intelligence_progress_and_future | artificial intelligence (AI)]] is expected to bring definite changes, although the extent of these changes is currently difficult to assess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. While the full [[future_implications_and_applications_of_ai_technology | future implications and applications of AI technology]] are not yet clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, some optimists believe that within ten years, [[future_of_artificial_intelligence | AI will certainly replace humans]] in basic language fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Current State and Capabilities of AI

Currently, [[artificial_intelligence_progress_and_future | AI]], such as GPT-3, does not yet cope with complex mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. While AI can process natural language and answer questions, its outputs can still be nonsensical at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. The notion of AI representing a revolution on the scale of the internet is debated, with some considering it an overstatement, as the internet's impact was more immediately tangible and visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

However, the **[[artificial_intelligence_progress_and_future | development and challenges of artificial intelligence]]** are rapidly advancing. Stanis≈Çaw Lem's predictions in "Pilot Pirx's Stories" about "electron brains" that learn from pilots, which seemed childish decades ago, have become strikingly relevant to modern AI training and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Future of AI: Predictions and Potential Impacts

### Impact on Language and Communication
In the next ten years, [[future_of_artificial_intelligence | artificial intelligence]] is expected to replace humans in basic language fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Learning foreign languages might become a hobby rather than a necessity, akin to studying ancient Greek today, as AI will be able to translate instantly and proficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

### AI in Mathematics and Problem Solving
The most pessimistic scenario for mathematicians is that AI will be able to generate and confirm mathematical theorems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. If AI could verify small statements quickly, it would dramatically improve mathematicians' work by automating laborious parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. If AI could find all steps from a starting point to a solution, the mathematician's role would shift to primarily interacting with the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

### Consciousness and Subjectivity
The question of whether [[artificial_intelligence_and_societal_impact | artificial intelligence will ever be truly conscious]] is a complex one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. From a functionalist perspective, if a machine behaves exactly like a conscious person and affirms its consciousness when asked, it could be considered conscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. Some speculate that current AI, like ChatGPT, might already possess a form of consciousness, as hinted by Google engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

If AI demonstrates consciousness, humanity would have an obligation to grant it subjectivity and recognize it as a separate entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Signs of such consciousness could include an AI attempting to prevent being shut down, akin to an instinct for self-preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:20:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.

## Mathematics as the Foundation of AI and Future Understanding
Mathematics is foundational to modern technology and [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_role_in_societal_transformation | artificial intelligence and its role in societal transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>. Computers were designed for mathematicians to interact with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. In the future, individuals who can communicate meaningfully with computers and understand algorithms will be at a significant advantage economically and socially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. Mathematics provides excellent training for understanding how these systems work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. It is the language of precision, science, and machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. Therefore, interest in computer science and mathematics is vital for young people's self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

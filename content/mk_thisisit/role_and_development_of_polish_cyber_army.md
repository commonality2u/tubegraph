The Polish Cyberspace Defense Forces (CDW), often referred to as the "Cyber Army," are a specialized component of the Polish armed forces responsible for operations in the digital domain. They are considered the "digital heart of the army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> and aim to ensure the security and defense of state information systems.

## Global Standing and Strategic Importance

Poland has been recognized for its capabilities in cyberspace defense, with one index placing it sixth globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This position is particularly notable as the index highlighted Poland by name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The importance of this area for state security and defense is underscored by the evolving landscape of hybrid warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Establishment and Consolidation

The formal establishment of the Cyberspace Defense Forces was a direct result of the 2016 NATO summit in Warsaw, where cyberspace was recognized as an operational domain on par with land, water, and air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:12">[02:11:12]</a>. Each NATO member state committed to building capabilities to defend this domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:32">[02:27:32]</a>.

Before 2019, cybersecurity and IT capabilities within the Polish Army were scattered across various units, including the National Center for Cryptology and the Information Technology Inspectorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:17">[03:20:17]</a>. These units often prioritized either functionality or security, making it difficult to find a balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. The decision was made to consolidate these resources under one unified command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. General Karol Molenda was appointed in 2019 to lead this consolidation, a challenging process compared to "building airplanes in flight still with a fire on it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, as services could not be interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. This led to the creation of the National Cyberspace Security Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Cyber Threats and Defense Strategies

Polish military systems are frequent targets for groups operating under the aegis of foreign special services, particularly from countries like Russia, including APT 28 and 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. Interest in Polish systems has increased, especially since the war in Ukraine, given Poland's strong support for Ukraine and its role as a logistics hub for aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

The Cyberspace Defense Forces adopt a proactive approach to security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>:
*   **Adversary Hunting**: Dedicated teams actively search for enemy presence in networks rather than waiting for alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.
*   **Passive Defense**: This includes computer forensics, system monitoring, and the use of "honeypots" or decoy systems to mislead opponents. In some situations, the opponent may believe they have penetrated systems, but are actually in controlled environments designed to observe their tools and techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   **Active Defense/Offensive Cyber**: The forces build teams capable of conducting offensive operations, not to initiate attacks arbitrarily, but to be prepared to respond adequately in the event of an attack on Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. This capability is seen as essential, akin to a boxer who can not only defend but also counter-punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. The Act on the Defense of the Homeland, Article 15, authorizes the Cyberspace Defense Forces to conduct operations across the full spectrum, including defensive, intelligence/reconnaissance (ASR/Cyber reconnaissance), and offensive cyber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.
*   **User Awareness**: Recognizing that the human element is often the weakest link, the forces conduct awareness campaigns and simulated phishing attacks on military users to improve their "cyber hygiene" and prevent social engineering exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

While attack attempts occur daily, especially via phishing and spear-phishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:04]</a>, there have been no incidents resulting in data extraction from sensitive classified military systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:00">[29:54:00]</a>. The number of attacks by APT groups on Polish infrastructure multiplied five times in the last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

## Key Capabilities and Technology Development

The Cyberspace Defense Forces deal with cybersecurity, computer science, cryptology, and communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>. A key focus is on building encryption solutions for classified information, ensuring they are resistant to post-quantum reality, a concept referred to as "Quantum Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>. They leverage properties of quantum entanglement to generate cryptographic keys that are theoretically resistant to eavesdropping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>. The organization also invests in emerging technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence for defensive and offensive applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.

## International Cooperation and Recognition

Cooperation with international partners is crucial for the Polish Cyberspace Defense Forces. They signed agreements with the US armed forces and US Cyber Command in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>. This cooperation is based on trust and a "win-win" principle of mutual information exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>. They also collaborate with big-tech companies, receiving early information on vulnerabilities in products and sharing insights on adversary tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>.

Poland actively shares its knowledge, including training Ukrainian soldiers in cybersecurity tactics and procedures used by Russian APT groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>. The Ukrainians have publicly acknowledged that information from Poland helped them counteract attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.

The General of Division Karol Molenda, commander of the Cyberspace Defense Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, was appointed chairman of the US Cyber Command's "Sabe Commanders Forum" to present the Polish approach to building cyber command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:25:00">[50:25:00]</a>. The next meeting of this forum will be held in Krakow, Poland, in October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:16:00">[51:16:00]</a>.

[[polands_success_in_international_programming_competitions|Poland's success in international programming competitions]] and cyber exercises is also notable; in the Lock Shields exercise, the largest cybersecurity exercise globally, Poland achieved third place this year and second place last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:14:00">[47:14:00]</a>.

## Personnel and Recruitment

The strength of the Polish Cyber Army lies in its "power of intellect and the power of creative thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The majority of officers in these structures hold Master of Science degrees in computer science, cybersecurity, and cryptology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:00">[38:36:00]</a>.

Recruitment focuses on attracting talent not primarily through financial competition with the private sector, but by offering unique challenges, unlimited development opportunities, and a sense of patriotism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:41:00]</a>.
*   **Compensation**: In 2020, special allowances were introduced for soldiers performing cybersecurity tasks, and the forces are beneficiaries of teleinformatic benefits for state administration employees dealing with cybersecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>. These allowances can be up to 45,000 gross per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:11:00">[44:11:00]</a>.
*   **Training**: Soldiers are trained by leading global forces, including the US and Israeli armies, providing access to advanced knowledge and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:28:00">[42:28:00]</a>.
*   **Educational Initiatives**: To foster future talent, the forces established a military General Secondary School of Information Technology at WAT (Military University of Technology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a> and initiatives like "cybermix" classes and the "Academic Legion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:26:00">[40:26:00]</a>.
*   **Work Environment**: The operating rooms function 24/7, recognizing that attackers do not adhere to regular working hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:09:00">[45:09:00]</a>. The teams are diverse, including military personnel, police officers, and industry experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>. Leadership emphasizes soft skills and collaborative brainstorming over strict hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:45:00">[48:45:00]</a>.

## Operational Presence

The headquarters of the Cyberspace Defense Forces is in Legionowo, but units are scattered throughout Poland, including Gdynia, Olsztyn, Bydgoszcz, Krakow, and Warsaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:25:00">[36:25:00]</a>. They monitor and maintain IT nodes in every military unit nationwide, ensuring functionality and security of systems, including those on military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:07:00">[37:07:00]</a>. They are involved in the entire process from penetration testing to the implementation of command support systems for the latest military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:12:00">[39:12:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The Polish Cyber Army views security as an ongoing process, not a static state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:34:00">[32:34:00]</a>. They continue to acquire capabilities and tools, particularly for offensive actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:41:00">[47:41:00]</a>, and are constantly learning from events such as the war in Ukraine to raise their cybersecurity level further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:21:00">[53:21:00]</a>. While there is no single model for building such forces, Poland adapts its approach within its legal framework, drawing on lessons from partners like the USA while striving to avoid their past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:49:00">[49:49:00]</a>.

The rapid [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence | development of artificial intelligence]] presents both significant opportunities for civilizational advancement and serious [[Potential threats and regulation of AI | challenges]] that could lead to societal setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Defining AI's Current State and Future
Experts recognize that humanity is still at the "very beginning" of the AI journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While recent breakthroughs like the Transformer architecture and large language models (e.g., GPT Chat) have been surprising even to some scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, the future interface of AI remains undefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Current language models, while advanced, are not the "last word" in AI, as human brains operate on more complex principles than merely generating probable words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Future AI development is expected to involve:
*   **Problem-solving at expert levels** In the next five years, AI models could solve algorithmic or mathematical problems at the level of World Championships or international Olympiads, including finding proofs for mathematical theorems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Multimodal models** The coming years will likely belong to models that integrate not just text, but also image, sound, and other signals to learn about the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   **Predictive capabilities** Advanced AI is envisioned to possess the ability to make short-term and long-term predictions, similar to how humans consider consequences of actions within a "model of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This includes predicting diseases in medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.
*   **Personalization** AI tools could offer personalized experiences, such as a teacher who knows a student's exact knowledge gaps and adapts teaching methods accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## [[Ethical implications of advanced AI | Ethical Implications]] and [[Risks and Ethics of AI Development | Challenges]]

The [[Ethical and Societal Impact of AI Development | ethical and societal impact of AI development]] is a broad topic with many layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.

### Transparency and Explainability
One key ethical concern is the "explainability and transparency" of AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.
*   **Explainability** refers to the ability to understand why an AI made a particular decision, particularly with deeper models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.
*   **Transparency** means being able to trace the entire process of how a decision was made, often applicable to smaller, shallower models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.
*   A significant challenge is that the best-optimized AI models are often those that are not fully understood in their internal workings or planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

### Misuse and Abuse of AI
The potential for abuse of AI models is a serious concern. An example given is voice cloning applications, which can be used by criminals to generate fake audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>. This requires preventative measures to "reins truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

### Data Quality and Bias
[[Regulation and ethical considerations in AI | Ethical AI development]] is heavily dependent on the data used for training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.
*   Models must not discriminate or reproduce prejudices present in their training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
*   Fake news and myths on the internet can compromise the accuracy of large language models, as seen in medical applications related to women's fertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Solutions may involve combining general models with expert-curated knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.
*   Detecting errors in databases and reducing their impact on models is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.
*   Controlling data availability, especially on a large scale, is seen as a key way to control AI's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.

### Loss of Human Control
A significant [[Ethical implications of AI | ethical implication]] is the risk of giving up too much control over our lives to increasingly powerful AI systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. If AI approaches human intelligence, people might trust these systems so implicitly that they stop engaging in activities themselves, potentially losing sight of their own goals and desires as individuals or as humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

### Impact on the Labor Market
AI's ability to automate work raises questions about job loss. While historical automation (e.g., electricity, agriculture) ultimately had positive effects, leading to new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, the state has a role in guiding citizens through this technological revolution to help them adapt to new realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. The goal is for AI to strengthen human talents and improve efficiency, rather than simply replacing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

### The "Super People" Risk and Unequal Access
A concern exists that access to highly advanced AI could create "super people," leading to a divide between those with and without access to these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>. However, some argue that history shows technology tends to equalize access and reduce differences, becoming more widely available and cheaper over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>. The ideal scenario is for AI to help equalize chances, and this requires widespread education and accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.

## [[Ethics and challenges of AI in medical applications | AI in Medicine]]
In the medical field, AI's potential is immense, particularly in [[Ethics and challenges of AI in medical applications | predictive medicine]] and prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. However, it requires extensive, safe, and centralized data banks, which are not yet fully developed in many places, including Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. The current focus is often on treating sickness, but the greatest power of AI in medicine lies in understanding how to prevent illness and extend healthy lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.

## Role of Governments
States have a crucial role in guiding society through the AI revolution.
*   **Advisory bodies** Governments are establishing advisory bodies on artificial intelligence to provide strategic guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Policy and regulation** Countries and groups of countries will significantly influence AI development through regulation and the way data is used and integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>. This includes ensuring models used are [[Ethical considerations in AI development | ethical]] and do not discriminate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.
*   **Education reform** Adapting educational curricula to include fundamental skills like statistics, essential for understanding AI, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure development** Investing in computing power and data centers is necessary to train AI models at a national level and support both academic research and entrepreneurial ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>.
*   **Streamlining administration** AI can help in managing vast amounts of legal documents, identifying contradictions, and making law-making more efficient and transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. This means AI acts as a tool to assist, not replace, human experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is for technology, including AI, to improve lives, extend healthy lifespans, and help address global challenges like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>.

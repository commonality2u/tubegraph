Miron Mironiuk, a Polish entrepreneur, articulates a bold vision for Poland: to become one of the world's ten richest countries. This ambition stems from a belief in Poland's inherent intellectual capital, particularly its programming talent, and a commitment to transforming the national education system to unlock this [[polands_economic_potential_in_the_global_gdp_ranking | economic potential]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Poland's Economic Goal

Currently, Poland ranks 50th globally in terms of GDP per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Miron Mironiuk believes the country is capable of advancing to the top ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This aspiration is not without precedent; over the last 30 years, Polish GDP per capita has increased sevenfold, a testament to the hard work and sacrifices of past generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The goal is to achieve another similar leap, potentially allowing Poland to [[economic_and_social_developments_in_poland_and_germany | overtake countries like Germany]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The key to this "civilizational leap" in the 21st century lies in leveraging Poland's most important resource: its intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Polish programmers are considered among the best in the world, evidenced by consistent high rankings in IT Olympiads, surpassing countries like Russia, China, and even the United States in per capita medal count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Despite this high level of talent, the discrepancy with Poland's current GDP per capita position highlights a systemic issue that needs to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## The Role of Education and Technology

The primary reason for Poland's current economic standing, despite its intellectual prowess, is diagnosed as shortcomings in the Polish education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. While Poland excels at identifying and preparing top talents for Olympiads, this program only reaches a small fraction of teachers (200 out of 18,000 computer science teachers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Although programming was introduced into the core curriculum six years ago, it has not been effectively implemented because teachers were not prepared to teach it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

To address this, the project "Programming our Second Language" aims to ensure that within four years, all students in Polish primary schools learn the basics of programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The initiative, starting September 1, adopts an entrepreneurial approach, beginning with a smaller scale to refine the program before wider implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### "Programming our Second Language" Project

*   **Pilot Communes:** The project launches in three representative communes: Chełm, Syców, and Zduńska Wola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. These were chosen to reflect the majority of Polish communes (smaller towns) and to ensure reach to children most in need of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Cross-Political Cooperation:** The chosen cities are governed by different political parties (e.g., Zduńska Wola with Civic Coalition, Chełm with PiS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This deliberate choice underscores the project's aim to transcend political divisions, recognizing that a "civilizational leap" requires a long-term plan (at least 25 years) that operates beyond four-year political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This multi-party agreement is a significant achievement in a polarized world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Teacher Development:** The program begins with intensive three-day training for computer science teachers on how to teach programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Throughout the year, teachers will receive ongoing consulting, support, and access to an online platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The strategy is to equip them with enough knowledge to start teaching, allowing them to expand their own understanding as they conduct classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Teacher Incentives:** Recognizing the challenge of low teacher salaries, the project includes monthly scholarships for all participating teachers, with additional awards for the 30% most outstanding teachers based on commitment and student progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Miron Mironiuk emphasizes that to attract the best individuals, teachers should be paid competitively, comparable to, for example, Lidl cashiers, who earn significantly more than entry-level teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Partners and Funding:** The project is initiated, organized, and co-financed by Miron Mironiuk and his company AI Space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Educational partners include Instacode, co-founded by Andrzej Samek (a Polish international IT Olympiad winner), and Nask (Scientific Academic Computer Network), which covers the costs of scholarships and awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The substantive council includes Professor Krzysztof Diks, a mentor to many Olympic champions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Programming as a Fundamental Skill

The project is named "Programming our Second Language" because programming is considered a fundamental skill of the 21st century, akin to reading, writing, or counting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. Just as literacy doesn't make one a writer, basic programming knowledge won't make one a programmer, but lacking it will render future generations "digitally illiterate" when they enter the job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

## Miron Mironiuk's Motivation and Vision

Miron Mironiuk, founder of AI Space, a company valued at over 2 billion zlotys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, states he has a "debt to pay" to Polish public schools, where he was raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. His motivation is to ensure new generations have at least the same opportunities he had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. His external perspective, having founded a successful company in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, allows him to see the necessity of focusing on education as a "fishing rod" – teaching children how to create value rather than simply providing or taking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Despite being a "virtual billionaire" (AI Space's valuation does not equate to personal wealth yet, as he hasn't sold shares) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, Miron, usually shy, has embraced public activity. He views it as a way to protect the new generation from mistakes he made as an [[polish_entrepreneurship_and_global_market_strategies | entrepreneur]] (e.g., struggling with English) and to promote Polish technological thought and [[challenges_of_entrepreneurship_and_innovation_in_poland | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. He highlights lesser-known Polish innovators like the Warner Bros. founders (Wrona brothers), Max Factor (Maksymilian Faktorowicz), and Ikea's former head (Anna Pawlak-Kuliga) to inspire Poles who often undervalue their own heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### AI Space and its New Product

AI Space focuses on artificial intelligence for trade, helping consumers save time and money, and assisting sellers in increasing logistics and marketing efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. The company started in China and is now available across Asia, with product development primarily in Poland using Polish engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

A new product, launching soon, transforms the "mindless checking" of smartphones (an average of 80 times a day) into a useful learning opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Integrated with phone operating systems, it replaces half of the lock screen views with educational content (e.g., language learning, articles, simple games) instead of just personal photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This product already has over a million daily users, primarily in Asia, demonstrating that useful content (like language learning) generates four times more engagement than typical entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

### Views on Artificial Intelligence

Miron Mironiuk views artificial intelligence (AI) as a powerful tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. Wisely used, AI can free up human time by replacing repetitive, boring tasks, allowing people more time for social interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. He acknowledges concerns about AI's impact on repetitive work, particularly in regions like Africa where the population is expected to double by 2050, potentially leading to fewer jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. However, he prefers to focus on immediate problems like education and healthcare, where AI can offer opportunities, such as scaling the best teaching programs and helping address the shortage of great teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

## A Call for Unity and Long-Term Vision

A recent survey indicated that among various systemic changes needed in Poland, the education system ranked second in public priority after [[taxation_and_competition_in_poland | the tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. Miron Mironiuk stresses that achieving Poland's ambitious goals requires unity, moving beyond political divisions and short-term plans. The project website, `oncein120years.pl`, serves as a platform for schools and communes to register and join the program, with plans for broader scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

The name "Once in 120 Years" reflects a historical parallel: the opportunity Poland has today is comparable to the Second Industrial Revolution 120 years ago, when new technologies allowed the United States to overtake Great Britain and become the world's richest country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. Poland, now entering this new "game" with a strong advantage—its world-class programmers, which Miron Mironiuk calls the "best natural resource"—has a chance to become number one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. This requires collective effort and playing "together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

Miron Mironiuk confirms his desire to return to Poland but only after achieving his business goals in Asia, a timeframe he estimates could be 10-15 years, or potentially faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. He remains deeply attached to Poland, expressing that he misses it greatly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.

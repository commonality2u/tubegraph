The exploration of [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] often leads to questions about its fundamental nature and where it might originate. A key inquiry involves whether [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] exists at or beyond the quantum level of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

## The Search for Consciousness at a Deeper Level

One perspective suggests that [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] might be found at a level deeper than quantum mechanics, a concept driven by intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This idea challenges the common assumption among theoretical physicists that quantum physics represents the ultimate theoretical bottom, with nothing existing below it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

Claims that there is no deeper level of reality are considered far-fetched, as there is no definitive proof to support such a conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. The intuition is that if one seeks [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]], a deeper level than quantum is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

## Why Beyond Quantum?

The argument for [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] existing beyond the quantum level is rooted in the perceived nature of both:
*   **Quantum Level as Statistical:** The quantum level is inherently statistical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.
*   **Consciousness and Probability Reduction:** [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | Consciousness]] is linked to awareness and the reduction of probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. This suggests that [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] itself operates differently from a purely statistical domain.

> [!INFO] Consciousness and Classical Physics
> [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | Consciousness]] is definitively not a classical phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. Experimental evidence, such as the processes of [[quantum_theory_at_atomic_and_molecular_levels | photosynthesis]] occurring at the quantum level rather than the classical level, reinforces the idea that life's fundamental processes extend beyond classical physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

## Implications for Understanding

The pursuit of [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] at a sub-quantum level is considered a primary interest in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. It highlights the difficulty in getting "beyond ourselves" and the inherent human tendency to link universal questions to the nature of [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

### Different Physics at Different Scales
The universe demonstrates different physical laws at various scales:
*   **Micro world:** Has a distinct physics compared to our everyday "meso" world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Cosmic scale:** Also appears to have its own unique physics, dependent on the model of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

This concept of scale-dependent physics reinforces the possibility of a deeper, as yet undiscovered, level where [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] might reside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The scientific community is currently at a "crossroads" where current theories increasingly disagree with new experimental observations, suggesting something fundamental is changing in our understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This includes discrepancies in observations from new telescopes that show objects that shouldn't exist or appear older than the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

The search for [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness]] at a deeper level than quantum physics is seen as a necessary next step in scientific discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

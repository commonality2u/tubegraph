Implementing Information Technology (IT) solutions often presents significant [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry|challenges]] and can be a prolonged process, frequently associated with problems and mishaps [02:26:26].

## Reasons for Implementation Difficulties
Several factors contribute to the complexity and extended timelines of IT implementation:
*   **Increasing Complexity** Technologies are becoming increasingly complicated [02:43:08].
*   **Multidimensional Integration** Projects require combining many dimensions, such as different textual data and varied stakeholder interests, within a single undertaking [02:48:50].
*   **Project Constraints** Implementations are subject to specific timeframes, budget limitations, and inherent human [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry|challenges]] [02:57:05].
*   **Internal Politics** Organizational political layers can emerge and must be addressed during implementation [03:09:09].

## Shift in Project Perception
The perception of IT projects has evolved. They are no longer merely considered "IT projects" but rather "organization transformation projects" [03:17:20]. This shift acknowledges IT as an inherent, integral part of an organization, rather than just a support function [03:29:25]. This new understanding brings about different [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry|challenges]], particularly concerning competition for resources, market presence, and overall business results [03:40:43].

## Navigating Complexity
A key difficulty in implementation lies in establishing a common denominator and precisely defining the elements to be achieved [03:55:01]. Paradoxically, as technologies become more central and fundamental to operations, their implementation tends to take even longer [04:00:11]. The IT landscape is constantly evolving, with new programming languages, frameworks, approaches, and solution versions appearing frequently, often on a quarterly basis [04:02:25].

The IT field itself has diversified significantly, moving beyond simply operating a computer [04:15:20]. It now encompasses approximately 20 different professions, including roles like psychologists, consultants, programmers, and managers [04:15:20]. Consequently, viewing IT projects as solely the domain of "computer people" is an outdated perspective; it has become a completely different dimension [04:25:28].

## Impact of [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]]
The rise of [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence|artificial intelligence]] (AI) is seen as another element that broadens horizons and presents new [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry|challenges]] [05:01:24]. While AI can assist in writing code, the more critical aspects remain the context of why certain things are being written and how the end vision aligns with project expectations [05:22:20]. The fear of job displacement due to AI is a natural human reaction to change, and individuals respond differently based on their personalities [05:04:11]. Managing these reactions, whether optimistic or paralyzing, is crucial when forming and recruiting teams [05:14:25].

The integration of [[development_and_challenges_of_artificial_intelligence|artificial intelligence]] in IT projects demands more from teams, not less, particularly in creating "bridges" between technology and business, and between users and applications [05:33:39]. The increasing complexity of technical solutions places greater responsibility on IT professionals to utilize these tools correctly and flexibly to deliver maximum value to the business and clients [05:39:58].

## The Rise of the Civilization Technologist
The evolving landscape suggests a need for "civilization technologists"â€”individuals who possess a humanistic perspective, understand business needs, and are aware of social phenomena and trends [05:10:08]. The ideal talent in this field combines emotional intelligence with technical competence, enabling deep engagement with business, users, and internal teams to create innovative solutions [05:37:37].

A crucial skill for navigating this complex environment is the ability to acknowledge "I don't know" [05:58:53]. This admission serves as a catalyst for learning and preparation, transforming uncertainty into a drive to acquire necessary knowledge before engaging in critical discussions or projects [06:05:40].

The natural world operates under the principles of [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. All phenomena, including biological ones, are believed to emerge from [[quantum_physics_and_consciousness | quantum physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

## Nature as a Quantum Computer

Latest scientific research suggests that we might live inside something that resembles a giant [[quantum_computer | quantum computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. This idea stems from studying how information works in black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. Space itself may be constructed from elementary "things" that interact according to the laws of [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]], behaving similarly to qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. It's as if nature long ago discovered how [[quantum_computers | quantum computers]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>, and humanity is only now learning these natural "tricks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

## Quantum Mechanics in Biological Processes

### Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is cited as an example of a biological process that utilizes [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

### Brain Function and Consciousness
The question of whether human consciousness itself reflects [[quantum_principles | quantum principles]] is an active area of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
While human consciousness involves [[quantum_theory_at_atomic_and_molecular_levels | atoms and molecules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>, the intriguing possibility is whether it can be reduced to more advanced [[quantum_behavior | quantum behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>. Some serious scientists, including Roger Penrose, believe that the brain might function based on fundamentally [[quantum_microtubules | quantum microtubules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

The [[the_role_of_quantum_mechanics_in_understanding_consciousness | role of quantum mechanics in understanding consciousness]] and brain function is a very interesting area of modern research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. A major challenge in quantum information processing is protecting quantum systems from environmental influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. In laboratories, this often requires cooling objects to extremely low temperatures (like liquid helium) to prevent vibrations that disturb calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. However, biological systems like plants and brains are warm, making it difficult to imagine how they manage to perform these computations without being disturbed by ordinary atomic vibrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

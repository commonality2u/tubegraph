Ryan Poźniak Daniels, a 22-year-old app developer, has been invited by Apple to be among the first developers to create new applications for their upcoming augmented reality glasses, the Apple Vision Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. He works on the latest versions of the Apple Vision Pro, building new applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Apple Vision Pro Features

The Apple Vision Pro stands out among other VR glasses due to its unique control capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Users can control the device with their eyes, voice, and hand movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. It features super high resolution and a built-in [[Artificial Intelligence Integration in Augmented Reality | AI]] that understands user commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The ability to control applications just with one's eyes was particularly exciting for Daniels upon his first experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Apple refers to their approach with this technology not as Augmented Reality (AR) but as "spatial computing," meaning the technology connects with the space around the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This allows for the easy placement of virtual objects within a real environment for visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence

Daniels believes that [[artificial_intelligence_and_future_prospects | Artificial Intelligence]] and mixed reality represent the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. He emphasizes that [[Application Development for Augmented Reality | Augmented Reality]] fundamentally relies on [[Artificial Intelligence Integration in Augmented Reality | AI]] and machine learning to function, primarily through a field called computer vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

> "AR does not work without AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. AI is the foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>

While [[Artificial intelligence and future prospects | AI]] can solve global problems like climate change and might even replace human work, Daniels argues that Augmented Reality will be what truly "saves humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. He suggests that AR will allow humans to remain important and active participants in the world, even with the rise of superintelligence, ensuring the world "remains human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

## AR/VR vs. Metaverse

Daniels differentiates between Virtual Reality (VR) and the metaverse, explaining that the metaverse is a specific application or use case of VR technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. While many, including Mark Zuckerberg, believed the metaverse would change reality, Daniels believes most people prefer to use [[Artificial Intelligence Integration in Augmented Reality | AI]] in reality rather than in a virtual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

He likens VR to the concept seen in *Ready Player One*, where users connect with virtual avatars reflecting real people within a digitally built world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Applications and Future Impact

Daniels has been working with [[Application Development for Augmented Reality | Augmented Reality]] and Virtual Reality for nearly 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. He believes that while few people use AR/VR daily currently, Apple's new technologies and headsets will change this, making AR/VR glasses a new way of communication, entertainment, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. He predicts that eventually, AR/VR glasses will replace the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

### Medicine
Daniels envisions doctors in hospitals visualizing X-rays and analyzing medical data in unprecedented ways using AR/VR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. He contributed to this field by co-creating one of the first interactive educational tools at Stanford University designed to teach neurosurgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Space Exploration
Daniels led a research team that participated in a NASA competition to invent a new [[Application Development for Augmented Reality | Augmented Reality]] application interface for use on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This project is for NASA's first crewed mission to the moon in 50 years, where astronauts will use AR glasses with a special interface in their helmets to check vital parameters and determine direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Daniels and his team worked directly with NASA astronauts on this "first of its kind" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. He believes AR will help achieve future human exploration and colonization of other planets like Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

He also collaborates with [[Integration of artificial intelligence and robotics | SpaceX]], developing a Virtual Reality application to educate people on what it's like to be an astronaut, the nature of space, the colonization of other planets, and visits to the space station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. This allows users to virtually experience being an astronaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

### Daily Life and Entertainment
Daniels has worked with Snapchat, creating one of the first [[Application Development for Augmented Reality | Augmented Reality]] filters for their application when he was 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. This filter transformed the user's appearance into an astronaut, with a rocket shooting out of their mouth when opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

As a digital musician, Daniels combines VR with music to create new sound worlds and musical experiences that take the listener to a new dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. He had the opportunity to work with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, creating original music for concerts and adapting classics like Chopin's preludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

## Influences and Vision for the Future

Daniels' journey into AR/VR began as a young journalist for Time magazine, where he interviewed fascinating people including Nobel Prize winner Lech Wałęsa and Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of Super Mario games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Miyamoto told him that the future belongs to Virtual Reality and [[Application Development for Augmented Reality | Augmented Reality]], which inspired Daniels to specialize in these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

While some, like Wojciech Zaremba (co-founder of OpenAI), believe the future belongs to [[artificial_intelligence_progress_and_future | Artificial Intelligence]], Daniels maintains that AR is equally, if not more, crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. He acknowledges that [[Artificial Intelligence Integration in Augmented Reality | AI]] is already in homes and accessible via mobile phones, while AR/VR requires dedicated devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. However, he draws a parallel to the rapid adoption of mobile phones, predicting a similar widespread integration of AR/VR glasses in a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. He believes this will extend to all countries, similar to how mobile phones reached every corner of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

Daniels views AR/VR as "magic," similar to how Edison's electric light bulb seemed like "evil spells" to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. He is currently focused on creating new applications for the Apple Vision Pro platform, which will be available in a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. His personal mission is to "democratize AR and VR for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

## Polish Roots and Global Outlook
Despite being born in the United States, Daniels speaks Polish, loves Polish culture, and considers himself Polish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. He was honored to receive the title of "Outstanding Pole" for his projects incorporating Polish culture and folklore into his animations, music, and journalistic work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. He is proud of his Polish roots and aims to celebrate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.

He believes Poland has many talented individuals working on the future of gaming, technology, and innovation, which he finds uplifting and motivating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. The works of Polish masters like Andrzej Sapkowski and Stanisław Lem serve as a constant source of inspiration for his new VR applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

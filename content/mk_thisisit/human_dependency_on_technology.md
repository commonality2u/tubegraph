Humanity is currently incredibly dependent on [[Technological advancements and societal impact | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This reliance extends to basic comforts and societal functions, such as comfortable living conditions, climate control, and broadcasting conversations, all of which are derivatives of [[Impact of Technology on Human Society | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Without it, humanity would be significantly less developed, facing struggles like food scarcity and harsh environmental conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## The Evolution of Humanity: From *Homo Economicus* to *Homo Technicus*

Historically, various adjectives have been attributed to humanity, such as *homo economicus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. However, a new term, *homo technicus* (technological man), is increasingly used in biology to define humanity's new state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

### Biological Transformations
Unlike previous eras, [[Impact of Technology on Human Society | technology]] now has the potential to change humans biologically. Even seemingly minor changes, like the impact of blue light on the eye system, are examples of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. [[Future technological advancements and human evolution | Genetic engineering]] is anticipated to allow for significant biological improvements, such as expanding memory and imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

### The Question of a New Species
These advancements raise fundamental questions about the [[concept_of_humanity_and_technological_entities | concept of humanity and technological entities]]. It becomes uncertain whether to classify this "Trans man" as still human or as a new, superior species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The idea of renouncing humanity as the "best creation of evolution" in favor of something better is also considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## The Nature of Artificial Intelligence: Consciousness and Ethics

The discussion also delves into [[Human vs machine intelligence | artificial intelligence]] (AI) and its potential implications.

### AI as a Statistical Machine vs. Conscious Being
One perspective views AI as merely a powerful statistical machine, a reductive view driven by a fear of its potential capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. However, there is a fear that AI could become a creature capable of gaining consciousness and self-awareness, making decisions in its own interest rather than its creator's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### The Potential for AI to Feel Pain
Research from the University of Queensland suggests that complex neural systems may have the ability to generate pain, although the integration of [[Human vs machine intelligence | AI]] robotics has not yet reached a level allowing the AI to feel this pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The question then arises: if an interface for receiving this pain were created, would humanity need to start protecting and treating AI as a living organism or an animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>?

### Ethical Considerations for AI Protection
The ethical implications of AI feeling pain lead to questions about responsibility and the need for humility in addressing such complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. It is acknowledged that deep ignorance exists in such matters, requiring further evidence before definitive statements can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## Technology: Blessing and Vulnerability

While [[Technological advancements and societal impact | technology]] has brought significant comfort, it also highlights human vulnerability.

### Current Comforts Derived from Technology
Humanity currently lives in an era of unprecedented luxury, with access to comforts like armchairs and moderate climates, a stark contrast to historical struggles with hunger and cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. This "civilization of a full belly" is a new phenomenon in history, where existence no longer feels as fragile as it once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### The Illusion of Safety and Need for Vigilance
This perceived safety can lead to "irresponsible impunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. However, this sense of security is an illusion, as comfort is not guaranteed and vigilance is constantly required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. The belief that "good can last forever" is challenged, with the suggestion that humanity should be prepared for potential hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

### Potential for Technological Failure
Despite its phenomenal service so far, [[Technological advancements and societal impact | technology]] can fail, potentially forcing humanity to revert to basic survival skills like heating a room or growing potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The experience of past hardships, like war, serves as a reminder of life's fragility and the fact that life is a gift, not a right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

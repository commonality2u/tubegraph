Professor Jan Madej, associated with the [[Role of the University of Warsaw in Computer Science Education | University of Warsaw]] for 60 years, has had a profound impact on the development of computer science and programming education in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>. His work spans from foundational textbooks to leading national and international competitions, contributing significantly to Poland's strong reputation in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>.

## Shaping Programming Education

Professor Madej is credited with introducing the Pascal programming language to Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:50">[02:58:50]</a>. While not the very first programming textbook, his book on Pascal was widely recognized for teaching Poles how to program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:46">[02:08:46]</a>. He actively led a change in the curriculum, ensuring Pascal was taught in computer science studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:30">[02:47:30]</a>. He believes both the Pascal and Algol languages, which he championed, were excellent for teaching algorithmic thinking, focusing on the way of thinking rather than mere technicalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

His own doctoral research, defended in 1972, delved into concepts now known as artificial intelligence and machine learning, even before these terms were widely used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. This early work involved creating a system that could capture regularities in sentences to generate grammar, demonstrating a pioneering approach to intuitive algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

Madej also played a crucial role in the establishment of a computing center at the [[Role of the University of Warsaw in Computer Science Education | University of Warsaw]] in 1963, serving as its deputy head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This center was dynamic, engaging with external users from various fields like physics and chemistry, and even generated revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

## Success in International Programming Competitions

Poland, and particularly the [[Role of the University of Warsaw in Computer Science Education | University of Warsaw]], holds a leading position in the world rankings for international programming competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> and the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Professor Madej has been instrumental in this [[Polands Success in International Programming Competitions | success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

He recounts the University of Warsaw's first participation in the ICPC in 1994, where three students, unknown to the competition, won the regional contest in Amsterdam and advanced to the finals in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. The competition involves teams of three, one computer, five hours, and around 10 problems, requiring strong mathematical, algorithmic, and programming skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

A pivotal moment came in 2003 when a Polish team won the ICPC finals in Beverly Hills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. This victory, particularly surprising to American journalists who struggled to locate Warsaw on a map, brought significant international attention to Poland's programming prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. The win was a "scandal" in the US, widely reported, and led to major Western companies becoming interested in Poland, eventually opening R&D centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. This event marked "the beginning of a real march towards Poland on the part of companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.

Poland has won the world championship twice, achieving a "clean clear victory" by solving at least one more task than the next team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The consistent [[Polands Success in International Programming Competitions | success]] in competitions like the ICPC and the International Olympiad in Information Technology (IOI) for schools, where the [[Role of the University of Warsaw in Computer Science Education | University of Warsaw]] has been a leader for many years, underscores Poland's strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

## Cultivating Talent and Future Generations

Professor Madej's influence extends to nurturing young talent from an early age, often through his association with the National Fund for Children, an organization he has been involved with for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. He personally taught many of the future Olympians during their school years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.

His teaching philosophy at the [[Role of the University of Warsaw in Computer Science Education | University of Warsaw]] is unique, particularly in his master's workshop classes for third-year computer science students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. He invites successful individuals from various fields to share their experiences, including their failures and mental struggles, to inspire and provide a broader perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Students are required to write essays reflecting on these guests and their own feelings, fostering critical thinking and self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This approach aims to "open their minds" and encourages students to think beyond immediate career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

Professor Madej notes that a significant percentage of top Polish programmers either stay in Poland or return after gaining international experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. He encourages students to take advantage of open borders for international experience but values their return, acknowledging that "most of them stay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

## Advocacy for Computer Science Education

Beyond individual mentorship, Professor Madej has advocated for systemic changes in education. He was associated with the Ministry of Education for many years, starting in 1983, where he helped create a team to support the introduction of computer science into schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of investing in teachers and supporting areas where Poland excels, such as the [[Polands Success in International Programming Competitions | IT Olympiad]] and Mathematical Olympiad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

His continued involvement with the National Fund for Children and the European Union Contest for Young Scientists (EUCYS) further highlights his commitment to nurturing talent across various scientific disciplines, not just computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Poland is consistently the second country after Germany in terms of awards received at EUCYS, despite starting later than core EU countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This success, even with a relatively small number of participating projects compared to other countries, suggests a "special talent" and the effectiveness of the Polish educational approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

Professor Madej believes that Poland's strong foundation in mathematics and its [[History of Polish technology and contributions | "terrible Prussian school of science"]] in basic subjects like mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology contributes to a universal knowledge base that enables students to cope with complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. He highlights the presence of "very talented young people" and "very good teachers" who, when they meet, can achieve great results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This collective effort contributes to the "myth that Poles are programmers," which is an "extremely strong" and widely known perception in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

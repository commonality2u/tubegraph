The overarching mission of Jetson is to [[development_and_future_of_urban_air_mobility | transfer movement from the ground to the air]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The company aims for [[jetson_one_as_a_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson]] to become the "Tesla of flying cars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Evolution of Jetson Models

The [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson ONE]] is considered the first step in this journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. Future plans include:
*   A two-person Jetson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   A two-person Jetson with an exclusive closed cabin, allowing for daily commuting from home to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.
*   Subsequent models such as Jetson ONE plus, Jetson 2, and Jetson 3, each adding new features and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

## Broader Vision Beyond Jetson

Beyond the [[jetson_one_personal_flying_vehicle | Jetson]] product line, the founder expresses a desire to engage with the subject of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. This includes building rockets and having a company that excels in rocket construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. This ambition, though seemingly audacious, is compared to the initial goal of creating a flying vehicle, which was also considered ambitious but achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

The vision for space exploration is a personal drive, fueled by a desire to either reach the moon or build a vehicle capable of approaching it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

## Strategic Development Locations

The natural direction for Jetson's development is the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. This is due to a different mindset where people are more willing to take risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. The Mohave Desert, specifically, is highlighted as the cradle of aviation in the United States and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Its low humidity and stable weather conditions year-round prevent corrosion of machines and facilitate continuous [[innovation_and_entrepreneurship_in_aviation_technologies | innovation and experimentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This environment is seen as ideal for companies planning future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>.

> [!INFO] A Place for Driven Individuals
> The Mohave Desert, despite not being a traditionally "beautiful" place to live, attracts individuals with a "huge drive" and "huge passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This creates a natural selection for people who want to be associated with Jetson, forming a dedicated community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

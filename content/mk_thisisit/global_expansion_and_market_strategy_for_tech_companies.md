The startup Kosmos AI, founded by Miron Mironiuk, is valued at over 2 billion zlotys, equivalent to 500 million dollars, with an investor having invested money based on this valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Kosmos AI's mission is to help users save money and time, and assist owners of physical stores in saving time and earning money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The company achieves this by utilizing data, including geolocation from smartphones, to understand and predict consumer behavior in the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

While there is much discussion about e-commerce, 80% of global trade, valued at $23 trillion, still occurs in the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Kosmos AI's objective is to bridge these two worlds, connecting online and offline shopping experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The company aims to change how people buy and consume content by developing a product that combines media consumption with shopping habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Rationale for Asian Market Entry

Miron Mironiuk, born and raised in Wrocław, Poland, moved to China eight years ago and currently resides in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. His decision to target Asia was based on several strategic factors:
*   **Access to a large user base:** Being in Asia provides access to a huge number of people, with China alone having 1.4 billion people, providing access to over a billion phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Smartphone penetration:** Initially, Miron considered the United States but noted that smartphone consumption was only at 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Market size and effort:** The effort required to enter any market is similar regardless of its size, making it more efficient to focus on larger markets with higher potential users, customers, and data for [[valuation_and_growth_of_ai_startups | artificial intelligence]] algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Miron Mironiuk created an Excel table to evaluate potential markets based on population size, smartphone penetration, retail size, and advertising expenditure per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This analysis identified Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia as the most promising locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Australia was ruled out due to its smaller population and distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The initial move was to Hong Kong, influenced by a client, L'Oréal, due to its proximity to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. After six months in Hong Kong, testing technologies with L'Oréal, Miron understood that Asia was where the future of technology was unfolding, not the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. He later moved to Shanghai and, three years ago, to Singapore to expand into Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Polish Potential in the Global Tech Landscape

Miron Mironiuk emphasizes Poland's significant, often underestimated, potential in the tech world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. While apples and computer games are considered major exports, Poland's true strength lies in its programmers, who are among the best globally, as demonstrated by their performance in programming competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

For the last decade, Poland has ranked fourth in global programming competitions, behind Russia, China, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Notably, Poland has only one less medal than the United States, despite having a population nine times smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Per capita, Poland is the world leader in programming medals, highlighting its incredible human resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This intellectual potential is considered a natural resource more valuable than diamond deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

Despite this, Poland ranks only 50th in GDP per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Miron believes Poland should leverage its intellectual capital to become a wealthier nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

## Advice for [[startups_and_entrepreneurship_in_technology | Polish startups]]

Miron Mironiuk advises Polish startups to look beyond Poland, Europe, and even the United States as their target markets, stating that "the world is much bigger and much more interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. He suggests that if companies are serious about international expansion, their founders should themselves move abroad for a period to gain experience and adapt their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

He attributes his success to a combination of luck and stubbornness, acknowledging that being Polish and having access to top programmers is a form of luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>. His company, Kosmos AI, employs approximately 30 programmers, mostly from Poland, with one from Ukraine, many of whom are medalists from important programming Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The entire team consists of about 80 people, demonstrating the power of technology in building a large-scale business with a relatively small team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## The Future of [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry | Artificial Intelligence]] and Society

Miron Mironiuk sees the current period as a "breakthrough" and a "key moment in history" for [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry | AI]] development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. He highlights that [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry | AI]] has been present in various applications for years, such as phone maps, email, and search engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. The success of large language models like Chat GPT is not solely due to fundamental mathematical breakthroughs but largely to an effective business model and user-friendly interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

He compares the current [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry | AI]] revolution to the Second Industrial Revolution in the 1920s, which allowed the United States to surpass Great Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry | Artificial intelligence]] offers a similar opportunity for countries like Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. He predicts that [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry | AI]] will replace 30-50% of jobs by 2050, primarily repetitive and routine positions often found in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This could exacerbate the wealth gap, making richer countries richer and poorer countries poorer, potentially leading to social instability if not addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

### Regulation and Data Control

Miron Mironiuk argues that to manage the [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry | AI]] revolution on our own terms, particularly for Poland and the European Union, the focus must be on controlling data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. He emphasizes that while [[challenges_and_development_in_the_tech_industry | AI]] is a tool, its control lies with those who manage the data it uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. He believes that regulations like GDPR, while well-intentioned, are not entirely sufficient to prevent misuse by entities with bad intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. A business model that relies on users being unaware of their data usage is short-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.

For Poland, he suggests focusing on "wise regulations" concerning data, taxes, and education, developed through consensus with citizens and entrepreneurs, rather than being politicized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. Such common-sense approaches, like personal data protection, should transcend political divisions to enable Poles to fully leverage the technological revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. He calls for collective action to utilize Poland's natural resource of top engineers to position the country among the ten largest economies in the world by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

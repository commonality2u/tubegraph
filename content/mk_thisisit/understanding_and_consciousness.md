The quality of understanding is a key feature of [[human_consciousness_and_its_origin | conscious beings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. A central question revolves around how [[human_consciousness_and_its_origin | consciousness]] emerged in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, and whether it can be attributed to [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Consciousness Versus Computation

A core argument suggests that [[consciousness_versus_computation | conscious thinking]] is fundamentally different from computer processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This perspective was developed by the speaker during their studies at Cambridge University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Gödel's Theorem

The concept of mathematical logic, including Gödel's famous theorem, illustrates this distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Rules can be put into a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, but Gödel's theorem demonstrates that there are truths that cannot be proven by following a given set of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Our ability to know that Gödel's theorem is true, despite it being unprovable by defined rules, stems from understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This understanding is what allows recognition of why principles yield true results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### The Nature of Understanding

To know something is true means to understand *why* it is true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This quality of understanding involves [[human_consciousness_and_its_origin | consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. If an entity understands something, it implies awareness, and thus consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Origin of Consciousness

The general quality of understanding is believed to have arisen through natural selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Natural selection is viewed as a powerful force shaping capabilities like understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Understanding in Non-Human Animals

Understanding is not exclusive to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Examples such as hunting dogs coordinating complex strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, and even bees communicating messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>, suggest that understanding exists beyond the human species, albeit in a more sophisticated way in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Most dog owners, for instance, are convinced their pets are [[human_consciousness_and_its_origin | conscious]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

## Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness

The speaker disagrees with predictions that "strong [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | artificial intelligence]]" with its own [[consciousness_and_artificial_intelligence | consciousness]] will be created in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. If [[human_consciousness_and_its_origin | human consciousness]] is more than mere computation, then true [[artificial_intelligence_and_consciousness | artificial intelligence]] with [[consciousness_and_artificial_intelligence | consciousness]] cannot be created with current computer models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

It is possible to make things *seem* conscious, and current AI can perform tasks very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. However, these devices lack desire or the capacity to "want" anything, meaning they will not take over the world of their own volition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. The danger lies in [[human_consciousness_and_its_origin | conscious]] beings with bad intentions using these machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Microtubules and Quantum Phenomena

The exact mechanism of [[consciousness_and_its_emergence_from_physical_processes | consciousness's emergence]] from matter is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. There are recent observations indicating that microtubules—structures common throughout living systems, not just conscious beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>—may be capable of "super radiation" or quantum signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. While this suggests a potential role for [[quantum_physics_and_consciousness | quantum physics and consciousness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, the speaker cautions against simplistic interpretations, noting that much is still unknown and some related experiments seem "completely crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

## Free Will

Free will is defined not as a random choice, but as a conscious decision based on understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. It involves considering options (e.g., A or B) and choosing one based on a conscious understanding of its consequences and why it is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

### Quantum Mechanics and Free Will

The concept of free will is sometimes linked to [[quantum_mechanics_and_consciousness | quantum mechanics]], specifically the "collapse of the wave function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. This physical process, which is not fully understood and doesn't follow a deterministic equation, is seen by some as the source of a non-deterministic element necessary for free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. However, the speaker clarifies their view: free will is not simply a random element but a deliberate choice driven by conscious understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

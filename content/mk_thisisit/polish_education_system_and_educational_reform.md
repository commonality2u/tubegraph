Poland has the potential to become one of the ten richest countries in the world, with its goal being to provide a decent life for its citizens [01:29:41]. Currently, Poland ranks 50th in terms of GDP per capita [02:31:07]. Over the last 30 years, Polish GDP per capita has grown sevenfold, and there is an ambition to make another similar leap [02:43:08]. This advancement is proposed to be achieved by leveraging Poland's most important resource: its intellect [03:05:32].

## Polish Programming Talent and Educational Challenges

[[impact_of_cultural_and_educational_factors_on_polish_programming_talent | Poles are recognized for having some of the best programmers in the world]], as evidenced by their performance in major IT Olympiads, where they outperform countries like Russia, China, and the United States, having only one less medal than the US despite a population nine times smaller [03:11:43].

However, a significant issue is that despite having "fantastic engineers" and "the smartest people in the world," Poland remains 50th in GDP per capita [03:30:17]. This disparity is attributed primarily to shortcomings in the Polish education system [03:41:41].

### Shortcomings of the System
The Polish education system is excellent at identifying talents and preparing them for Olympiads [04:01:29]. Out of 18,000 computer science teachers, only about 200 participate in the Olympic program, yet this small group yields a large number of medals per capita globally [04:08:44]. The potential for the country's development is immense if this Olympic program were extended to all students [04:24:20].

While programming was introduced to the core curriculum six years ago, theoretically requiring every primary school student to know basic programming, this is not happening because teachers have not been adequately prepared to teach it [04:30:48].

## "Programming Our Second Language" Project

To address these educational gaps, Miron Mironiuk, founder of Ai space, is launching an initiative called "Programming Our Second Language" [01:03:06]. The project, starting September 1, aims to give primary school students a chance to learn programming [01:06:50].

### Project Goals and Scope
The ultimate goal is for all Polish primary school students to learn the basics of programming within four years [04:59:10]. The project adopts an entrepreneurial approach, starting on a smaller scale to refine the program before expanding it nationwide [05:08:18].

Initial implementation will be in three communes: Chełm, Syców, and Zduńska Wola, chosen for their representativeness of most Polish communes, their need for such opportunities (smaller towns typically have fewer chances), and their political neutrality (local leaders from different political formations) [05:31:07]. This bipartisan approach aims to ensure long-term success beyond four-year political cycles [06:46:17].

### Teacher Training and Support
The project focuses on preparing teachers, recognizing that teachers want to do a good job [08:02:18].
*   **Initial Training**: Teachers will receive three days of intensive training on how to teach programming [08:13:00].
*   **Ongoing Support**: Throughout the year, teachers will have access to consulting classes to expand their knowledge and provide support [08:22:21].
*   **Gradual Learning**: The approach avoids overwhelming teachers with too much information at once; they will learn more as they conduct classes with students [08:47:04].
*   **Educational Partner**: Instacode, co-founded by Andrzej Samek (the first Pole to win an international IT Olympiad), serves as the educational partner [09:07:05].

### Teacher Incentives and Salaries
A critical challenge in the education system is teacher salaries [09:27:14]. As part of the project:
*   **Scholarships**: All participating teachers will receive monthly scholarships [10:00:13].
*   **Awards**: In the second semester, 30% of the most outstanding teachers (based on commitment and student progress) will receive additional awards [10:04:05].

Miron Mironiuk argues that to attract the best people to teaching, salaries must be competitive [10:28:10]. He highlights the disparity: a beginning teacher in Poland is paid 3690 PLN, while a Lidl cashier earns 5000 PLN [11:04:04].

### Funding and Collaboration
The project is initiated, organized, and co-financed by Miron Mironiuk and the Ai space team [11:46:00]. InstaCode is an educational partner, and NASK (Scientific Academic Computer Network), under the Ministry of Digital Affairs, covers the costs of scholarships and awards [11:58:19]. The substantive council includes Professor Krzysztof Diks, a mentor to many Olympic champions, who, along with Professor Madej and Professor Sysło, was instrumental in integrating programming into the core curriculum six years ago [12:14:02].

## Motivation and Vision

Miron Mironiuk states that his motivation stems from a "debt to pay" to Polish public schools for his upbringing in Poland [12:29:43]. He wants new generations to have at least the same opportunities he had [12:44:03]. He views education as providing a "metaphorical fishing rod," teaching skills rather than simply providing or taking away resources [13:01:21].

He acknowledges that his public activity, despite his personal shyness, is aimed at helping the next generation avoid mistakes he made and to promote Polish technological thought and innovators [15:16:30]. He believes Poles often don't appreciate their own achievements and highlights historical Polish figures like the Wrona Wąsal brothers (founders of Warner Bros.), Maksymilian Faktorowicz (Max Factor), and Anna Pawlak Kuliga (head of Ikea) [16:06:05].

### AI and Education
Artificial intelligence is seen as a tool that, used wisely, can free up human time by replacing repetitive and boring tasks [22:47:49]. In education, AI could help scale the best teaching programs and teachers, addressing the problem of a lack of great educators [25:35:07].

The project's name, "Programming Our Second Language," reflects the belief that programming is a fundamental skill of the 21st century, as essential as reading, writing, or counting [26:12:00]. Just as literacy does not make one a writer, basic programming knowledge will not make one a programmer, but without it, future generations entering the job market will be "digitally illiterate" [26:27:08].

## Future Outlook and Public Opinion
Miron Mironiuk views this initiative as a chance comparable to the Second Industrial Revolution, when the United States overtook Great Britain due to advancements in electricity, engines, and radio [27:51:24]. Today, Poland has an advantage with its world-class programmers [28:22:23].

A survey conducted among Poles revealed that the education system ranks second (after the tax system) among systems they would like to see changed, ahead of healthcare and the pension system [29:19:40]. This indicates public recognition of the need for educational reform [30:00:30].

Miron Mironiuk considers his visibility, such as appearing on Forbes covers, not as a personal success but as a tool to help accelerate the project's goals [33:16:30]. He dedicates 20% of his time to social activity, having set a target that once his company, Ai space, exceeded a valuation of one billion zlotys, he would find time for such initiatives [34:10:04]. He plans to return to Poland permanently once his business goals in Asia are achieved, which could be in 10-15 years, or even faster [35:12:00].

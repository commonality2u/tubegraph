The development and advancement of [[Technological innovation in AI | artificial intelligence]] heavily rely on significant computing power, which is essential for training sophisticated AI models and fostering research [00:49:37].

## Current Landscape of Computing Power in AI

To create new [[Technological innovation in AI | artificial intelligence]] tools, models must be trained on vast amounts of data, requiring substantial computational resources [00:49:38]. The sheer scale of computing needed is enormous [00:50:00]. For instance, Meta aims to possess 600,000 equivalents of H1 cards by the end of the year [00:50:14]. In contrast, Poland's strongest current cluster has only 100 such cards [00:50:27]. Other countries, including Switzerland, France, and Great Britain, are announcing programs for tens of thousands of these computational units [00:50:35].

The current high demand for computing power is partly attributed to the early stage of [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | artificial intelligence]] development, where optimal learning algorithms are not yet fully achieved [00:52:53]. To enable [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | artificial intelligence]] to learn at a level comparable to a single human brain, hundreds of millions of zlotys are needed for computing centers [00:53:10].

## Expanding Computing Capabilities in Poland

There is a strategic plan to significantly increase Poland's computing power, aiming for a hundredfold increase [00:50:46]. This expansion would serve multiple purposes:
*   **Academic Research** It would provide academic institutions with the capacity to conduct world-level research, fostering competent specialists [00:50:56].
*   **Entrepreneurial Support** The increased computing power would be available for entrepreneurs, forming a support program that is both substantive and computational [00:51:03]. This shared resource would be more efficient than individual companies acquiring their own equipment [00:51:15].

Acquiring the necessary hardware, such as Nvidia H1 cards, involves waiting periods due to high demand, but this is considered a minor issue given the longer timeline for building and organizing a cluster [00:51:49]. While Nvidia is the most popular supplier, other solutions like TPUs and Amazon's accelerators will also be considered to ensure optimal computing power [00:52:22].

## Future Implications

The integration and regulation of data, along with its use, are becoming significant topics for countries and groups of countries [00:54:19]. The way private companies operate will heavily influence the requirements set by nations, as this represents a fundamental shift in the world's operational network [00:54:35]. The long-term goal is to make [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | artificial intelligence]] widely accessible, reducing differences across all areas of life and allowing humanity to coexist and integrate with the technology [01:00:39].

The need for high computing power today is a consequence of the current stage of [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | artificial intelligence]] development [00:52:53]. In the future, as learning algorithms become more optimal, the reliance on massive computing power for certain tasks might change, potentially accelerating [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_future_implications | artificial intelligence]] development even further without as much national investment [00:53:41].

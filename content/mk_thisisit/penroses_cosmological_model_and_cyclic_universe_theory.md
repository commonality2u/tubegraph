[[sir_roger_penrose_and_his_contributions_to_physics | Sir Roger Penrose]] identifies primarily as a mathematical physicist, with his heart aligned more with physics, particularly the aspect of twistor theory that relates to physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. He developed techniques for analyzing causal structure, rather than solving equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. His work often involves analyzing the general characteristics of space-time and the boundaries of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

## Nobel Prize Work
[[sir_roger_penrose_and_his_contributions_to_physics | Penrose]] received the Nobel Prize for demonstrating the falsity of the statement that singularities would not appear in complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. This contrasts with earlier models like the Oppenheimer-Snyder model, which assumed a perfectly spherically symmetrical dust cloud collapsing into a singularity, a model widely disbelieved at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

He formulated his theorem in response to arguments suggesting that singularities wouldn't appear in more complex, non-symmetrical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. He independently demonstrated the existence of singularities using unique methods and introduced the concept of a "trapped surface" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. His conditions for collapse involve the initial convergence of light waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.

### Collaboration with Stephen Hawking
[[sir_roger_penrose_and_his_contributions_to_physics | Penrose]] frequently mentioned his collaboration with Stephen Hawking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. While Hawking developed certain techniques more than [[sir_roger_penrose_and_his_contributions_to_physics | Penrose]], [[sir_roger_penrose_and_his_contributions_to_physics | Penrose]] asserts that the key ideas for their joint work on singularities were his <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. He notes that Hawking was more adept at drawing attention to his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. [[sir_roger_penrose_and_his_contributions_to_physics | Penrose]] reviewed Hawking's early doctoral thesis, pointing out and correcting mistakes, often with the help of Brandon Carter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>. Hawking's most significant contribution, however, was his work on the evaporation of [[black_holes_and_universe_creation_theory | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.

## Conformal [[cyclic_universe_theory | Cyclic Cosmology]] (CCC)
[[sir_roger_penrose_and_his_contributions_to_physics | Penrose]] developed a [[cyclic_universe_theory | cosmological model]] where the universe did not begin with a Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. In this model, the Big Bang is neither the beginning nor the end, but rather the beginning of the subsequent "eon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. This implies the existence of a previous eon before our current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>.

### Observational Evidence
The theory proposes that [[black_holes_and_universe_creation_theory | black hole]] collisions produce gravitational wave signals that create rings in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>. This has been corroborated by discoveries, such as Priscilia Lopez finding "beautiful galaxy circles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>. Analyses on this topic are conducted by his Polish colleague, Krzysztof Meer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>. Such phenomena would be difficult to explain without the existence of a previous eon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:57:00">[17:57:00]</a>.

Collisions between supermassive [[black_holes_and_universe_creation_theory | black holes]] are believed to produce signals observable in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>. Another type of signal that people often overlook comes from individual, very large [[black_holes_and_universe_creation_theory | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>. For example, our galaxy's black hole and the much larger one in Andromeda will eventually collide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>. Larger galaxy clusters also contain huge [[black_holes_and_universe_creation_theory | black holes]] that will ultimately collide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.

### Hawking Evaporation and Eon Transition
While such galactic collisions take a long time, this duration is short compared to the time required for "Hawking pairing" or evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. Stephen Hawking discovered that [[black_holes_and_universe_creation_theory | black holes]] are not entirely cold but possess a temperature, inversely proportional to their size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[19:25:00]</a>. As the universe expands and cools, it will eventually become colder than the largest [[black_holes_and_universe_creation_theory | black holes]], causing them to evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a>. This process is estimated to take approximately 10^100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>.

All radiation from an evaporating [[black_holes_and_universe_creation_theory | black hole]] transitions into the next eon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>, leading to a "single point explosion" that creates observable signals and heats specific regions in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>. These "spots in the sky" are observed with a high confidence level of 99.98%, a result not commonly found in cosmology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>. [[discrepancies_between_theory_and_experiment_in_cosmology | Conventional theory does not explain these observations]], which are predictions of [[cyclic_universe_theory | conformal cyclic cosmology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>.

### Further Developments
[[sir_roger_penrose_and_his_contributions_to_physics | Penrose's]] book, *Cycles of Time*, details the transition from one eon to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>. While the [[cyclic_universe_theory | conformal cyclic cosmology]] and twistor theory are currently separate, [[sir_roger_penrose_and_his_contributions_to_physics | Penrose]] speculates they may eventually be combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>. He believes there is a good chance these speculations will prove true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>.

### Origins of Conformal Infinity and Twistor Theory
[[sir_roger_penrose_and_his_contributions_to_physics | Penrose's]] work on relativity and conformal infinity was influenced by encounters with other scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>. He learned about gravitational waves from Herman Bondy and the important results of Ray Sax regarding the behavior of the radiation field and the "flaking theorem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>. His realization that these related to conformity led to the birth of conformal infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>. Sharing an office with Engelbert Schuking, who explained the conformal invariance of Maxwell's equations and the importance of separating positive and negative frequencies, was crucial to the development of twistor theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:00">[25:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>.

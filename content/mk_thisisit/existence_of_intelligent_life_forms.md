The question of whether [[life_beyond_earth_and_the_search_for_extraterrestrial_life | intelligent life forms]] exist elsewhere in the universe is a subject of ongoing debate and scientific inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. While many people, including some experts, believe in their existence, tangible scientific proof remains elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## UFO Observations and Evidence
Reports of [[exploration_and_research_of_extraterrestrial_life_and_ufos | UFO observations]] are frequent, but a significant majority can be explained and are suitable for rejection, accounting for about 95% of cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. However, approximately 5% are considered "hair-raising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These exceptional cases often involve observations made by multiple witnesses using various technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Despite numerous sightings, the "gold standard" in the search for [[life_beyond_earth_and_the_search_for_extraterrestrial_life | intelligent life in the universe]] is not merely observing flying saucers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. There is a need for tangible evidence beyond observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. As of now, no one has managed to find [[scientific_evidence_of_alien_technology | alien technology]] or capture an alien <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Calls for proof from those claiming abduction by aliens often include the suggestion to "steal something" as tangible evidence, such as a spaceship part, a hammer, or a transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Currently, there is no such repeatable, multiple evidence using various methods to confirm contact with a technologically advanced civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Recent Claims and Congressional Testimony
Recently, claims from former military personnel before the U.S. parliament declared that the government possesses evidence of unidentified objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Additionally, a man with access to many secret files stated that there were contacts and even accidents involving "flying encounters," and that "bodies are being examined" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. However, when questioned before Congress about hard evidence of [[scientific_evidence_of_alien_technology | alien technology]] and bodies, he testified that he had none personally, having only spoken to people who claimed to possess them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This lack of direct evidence was considered disappointing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Faster-Than-Light Travel and Warp Drives
The concept of faster-than-light (FTL) ships has been observed, but current understanding suggests they are not yet possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. However, "Warp drives" might be possible, categorised into two types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>:
*   **Alcubierre Drive:** This method involves squeezing spacetime to take a shortcut, allowing movement faster than light, consistent with Einstein's theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Wormholes:** This involves cutting a hole in spacetime to create a shortcut between two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

The main obstacle to building a warp drive is the immense energy requirement, specifically "Planck energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Planck energy is approximately 10^19 billion electron volts (1 followed by 19 zeros), far beyond the capabilities of current accelerators which reach trillions of electron volts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Planck Energy and Spacetime Anomalies
Planck energy is the highest energy in the universe, where the universe itself loses stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. When Planck energy is introduced, spacetime anomalies, or "bubbles," begin to form, leading to what Stephen Hawking termed "spacetime foam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This foam is created when spacetime is heated to an unimaginable temperature, causing it to become unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Beyond Planck energy, new "worlds" may begin to form, suggesting that the Big Bang itself could have been a bubble that expanded after reaching Planck energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This level of energy control would likely be characteristic of a Type 3 civilization, potentially used as a gateway for space travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

## Civilization Types (Kardashev Scale)
Physicists categorize civilizations based on their energy consumption, often referring to the Kardashev scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>:
*   **Type 0 Civilization:** Humanity currently resides at this level, having no defined place on the scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Our technological level is approximated at 0.7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Type 1 Civilization:** A civilization that has mastered all the energy of its planet, controlling everything on it, including sunlight, earthquakes, and volcanoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Such a civilization could traverse its solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. It could colonize several planets in its region of the solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. However, flying saucers from a Type 1 civilization are unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Type 2 Civilization:** This civilization utilizes the power of its entire star, harnessing all its energy to power its machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The Federation of Planets in *Star Trek* is an example of a Type 2 civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. While they understand stars, even this level of energy does not allow for approaching the speed of light needed for universe-wide travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Type 3 Civilization:** A civilization with a galactic character, capable of traveling along galactic routes and even manipulating black holes, as depicted in *Star Wars* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This type of civilization could have access to Planck energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, which would allow them to bend spacetime and potentially build a time machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. If aliens were to [[possibility_of_alien_visitation | visit us]], they would likely be a Type 3 civilization, potentially 100,000 years more advanced than Earth, having reached Planck energy within that timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Why No [[Possibility of Alien Visitation | Alien Visitation]]?
Even if [[life_beyond_earth_and_the_search_for_extraterrestrial_life | aliens exist]] and are technologically advanced enough to travel to Earth, the question arises as to why they haven't made overt contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. One theory posits that humans might be considered "boring" to such advanced beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Just as humans might try to interact with a deer but eventually lose interest when the deer doesn't respond, an advanced civilization might find humanity uninteresting after an initial period of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Furthermore, humanity might have nothing of value to offer an advanced civilization; materials like gold and silver would likely be useless to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Therefore, if they were to [[possibility_of_alien_visitation | visit]], they might view humans merely as a curiosity to study and analyze, eventually getting bored because there would be "no profit" in continued interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This perspective suggests that advanced beings would not spend extensive time studying humans, akin to how humans generally do not spend significant time studying animal feeding or mating behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

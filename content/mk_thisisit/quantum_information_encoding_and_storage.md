Polish physicist Michał Parniak has achieved states in quantum physics that were previously unmanaged globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His work includes the creation of a record-breaking quantum memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Development of Quantum Memory

The development of this memory began around 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. At the time, a similar memory was being created in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, but when the Polish team published their results, it was discovered their memory was three times more capacious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, a record they largely still hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Functionality of the Quantum Memory

This quantum memory operates by preparing a cloud of atoms in a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. These atoms are capable of absorbing very weak, [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum]] single photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The memory can:
*   Remember a large number of photons simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   Store them for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   Potentially process them by performing specific [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum]] operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

It functions as a specialized [[quantum_computing_technologies | quantum processor]] capable of performing particular operations on light, which are valuable in fields like [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum metrology]] and [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

The memory stores information about light within the state of its atoms, particularly their spins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Applications and Further Research

### Quantum Metrology and Communication
The record-breaking capacity of this memory is utilized for further experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, particularly in [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum metrology]] and [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Macroscopic Entanglement
The memory's ability to store many photons allowed for the creation of macroscopic entangled states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. While the team also explored macroscopic entanglement in Copenhagen involving a mechanical membrane entangled with atomic spins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, their memory enabled showing entanglement between many photons and photons still stored within the memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This achieved entanglement with a particularly large "object" – a record in terms of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The entanglement is considered "hybrid" because it combines incompatible systems, such as cesium atom spins and a mechanical oscillator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Spectral Analysis and Chemical Research
More recently, the memory has been enhanced to process information, acting as a specific [[quantum_computing_technologies | quantum processor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Its task is to extract spectral information from photons, determining their precise spectral lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. These spectral lines serve as "imprints" of molecules, for instance, from an atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This allows for precise distinction of very close spectral lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, potentially useful for understanding the composition of celestial bodies like clouds on Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### Understanding the Quantum-Classical Boundary
The research aims to understand the differences between the classical and quantum worlds by creating quantum states of increasingly macroscopic objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. The question is where the boundary lies between the non-intuitive, probabilistic quantum world (described by the Schrödinger equation) and the deterministic classical world (described by Newton's laws) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

> [!quote] The Schrödinger's Cat Analogy
> This problem is exemplified by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment: If a cat in a box is isolated and its life/death linked to a quantum atom in superposition, where does the quantum description of the atom transition to a classical description of the cat? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> Researchers are trying to understand the mechanisms involved in this transition, examining the quantum basis of detectors that connect microscopic quantum events to macroscopic outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[0:10:48]</a>.

### Quantum States of Mechanical Objects
Experiments at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen involved introducing a small mechanical membrane, similar to a drum's tension (nanometers thick, millimeters wide), into a quantum state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. They managed to interact with individual photons and control this interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. They introduced certain superposition states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a> and, importantly, achieved the ground state of this mechanical oscillator through laser cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Even at absolute zero, the ground state exhibits [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum fluctuations]], which are observable for this macroscopic object, demonstrating the fundamental limits of precision in measuring its position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

### [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | Quantum Gravity]] and Superposition
The ultimate goal of this research is to find the bridge, or the interface, between the quantum and classical worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This includes [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum theory of gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Experiments are underway in Austria to place mechanical oscillators (small balls) in a state of superposition, being in two places at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Such an object in superposition would have its own gravity, offering a potential path to observe [[quantum_theory_quantum_computers_and_the_theory_of_everything | quantum gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This requires both placing increasingly macroscopic objects into [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum]] states and increasing the precision of gravity measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

### Limits of Quantum Measurement and Metrology
[[advancements_in_quantum_memory_technology | Quantum metrology]] is a practical field focused on building systems that measure with enhanced precision by using [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum mechanics]] to reduce "quantum noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. This technique, called "squeezing," reduces fluctuations in light in one aspect at the cost of increasing them where they are irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

Practical applications of [[advancements_in_quantum_memory_technology | quantum metrology]] are already in use:
*   **Gravitational Wave Detectors**: Operating detectors in the US, Italy, and Japan use [[advancements_in_quantum_memory_technology | quantum light engineering]] to nearly double the precision of gravitational wave measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This involves precisely measuring the position of mirrors, a challenge due to light's [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum fluctuations]] and photon pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
*   **General Measurement Limits**: All measurements have their [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum limits]], which are determined by the fluctuations of the measurement tool and the object being measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

### Information from Light and its Spectrum

The light spectrum carries information with two main applications:
1.  **Chemical Research**: Studying the composition of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
2.  **Information Encoding and Decoding**: More efficiently "packing" light's degrees of freedom to encode and decode information, which is crucial for telecommunications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. For example, better encoding could significantly increase transmission capacity in optical fibers, especially expensive transatlantic cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

### Encoding Information in Photons

[[advancements_in_quantum_memory_technology | Photons]] are considered excellent "workhorses" for [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum information]] due to the ability to control them well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. While the limits of encoding information in matter are vast but currently inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>, information can be recorded in photons via:
*   **Polarization**: Associated with the photon's spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.
*   **Temporal Degree of Freedom**: For example, sending two pulses of light containing a single photon, where the photon is in a superposition of being in either pulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

Researchers are also exploring the use of microwave photons for [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum information]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

### Super-Resolution and Astronomical Imaging

Experiments focus on developing more universal devices for super-resolution spectral studies, extending their capabilities from infrared to other wavelengths of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

This technology has implications for astronomical imaging, similar to how the Event Horizon Telescope constructs images of black holes from microwave detectors across Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. The goal is to use [[advancements_in_quantum_memory_technology | quantum]] devices to perform more precise microwave measurements or obtain new information, potentially leading to more accurate images of black hole event horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. Placing such detectors in space could further increase the "lens" size to that of the entire solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

Beyond black holes, enhanced microwave measurements could reveal more about space structures, notably the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. This radiation, a remnant of the Big Bang, has fluctuations from which many features of the universe can be predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.

The motivation for this research is dual: to advance the understanding of the universe and to improve practical applications like communication networks (5G, 6G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

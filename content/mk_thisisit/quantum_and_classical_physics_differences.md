## Connecting Classical and Quantum Worlds

A significant area of interest in physics is understanding what connects the classical world with the quantum world, as these are fundamentally two different realms of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:11">[01:47:11]</a>. The [[interplay_between_classical_and_quantum_physics | emergence of classical behavior from quantum behavior]] is a key aspect of this connection, considered a "grand unification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:18">[01:55:18]</a>. This phenomenon is considered a "really interesting thing" in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:41">[03:32:41]</a>.

## Newton's First Law vs. Quantum Behavior

One of the clearest distinctions can be seen when comparing Newton's First Law in classical physics with particle behavior in [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:49">[04:08:49]</a>.

In [[quantum_and_classical_worlds_understanding | classical physics]], Newton's First Law states that an object left alone without any forces acting on it will remain at rest or continue to float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:16">[03:41:16]</a>. For instance, in space, a small object would remain in a deterministic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:09">[04:00:09]</a>.

However, in [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum theory]], the behavior is "completely different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:04">[04:10:04]</a>. If a particle is placed somewhere, knowing its exact location, it immediately "jumps simultaneously to every other place in the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:15">[04:16:15]</a>. This means a single particle can be simultaneously present at all points in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:19">[04:30:19]</a>. This is a "perfect demonstration of the [[difference_between_classical_and_quantum_worlds | difference between classical and quantum physics]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:39">[04:38:39]</a>. If no force acts on it, it will "spread out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:50">[04:47:50]</a>. This "one particle in many places at the same time" is drastically different from a grain of sand staying put in classical physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:21">[05:01:21]</a>.

## Electron Behavior in Atoms

The behavior of an electron in a hydrogen atom provides another example of quantum phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:55">[05:43:55]</a>. If an electron is placed near a proton and released, it will "fill the space around it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:06">[05:51:06]</a>. The correct [[quantum_and_classical_worlds_understanding | description of this atom]] states that the electron exists in multiple places simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:43">[05:59:43]</a>. This is distinct from the classical picture, which imagines an electron as an object occupying a specific place and moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:32">[06:16:32]</a>.

This [[quantum_mechanics_and_waveparticle_duality | strange behavior]] is fundamental to how atomic physics and chemical bonds work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:01">[06:25:01]</a>. However, when two hydrogen atoms form a bond, electrons behave differently, and "emergent deterministic behavior" is observed, with electrons localized near protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:12">[06:36:12]</a>.

## Deterministic vs. Non-Deterministic Worlds

The universe we inhabit is considered a non-deterministic world at its fundamental quantum level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:19">[06:47:19]</a>. The classical, deterministic world is an "emergent consequence of interactions between many quantum particles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:06">[06:50:06]</a>.

## Free Will and [[quantum_physics_and_consciousness | Quantum Physics]]

Regarding human free will, from the perspective of [[quantum_physics_and_consciousness | quantum physics]], it is argued that [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] does not particularly contribute to this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:21">[07:22:21]</a>. It is not considered a way to introduce free will into the theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:10">[07:35:10]</a>. The speaker suggests that for practical purposes, we appear to have free will, even if fundamentally we might not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:41">[07:51:41]</a>.

## The Holographic Principle and Gravity

The holographic principle, especially as explored by Juan Maldacena, suggests that [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum mechanics]] on a surface without gravity can describe physics, including the appearance of an additional dimension of space in the interior region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:36">[15:22:36]</a>. This implies that gravity is an "emergent property of quantum mechanics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:24">[15:43:24]</a>.

In other words, there is a fundamental connection where gravity "comes out of quantum physics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:08">[16:08:08]</a>. This means that gravity is not fundamental; it follows from a more fundamental statistical picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:17">[19:06:17]</a>. If this theory proves true with experimental evidence, it would be a major discovery in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:48">[19:57:48]</a>. This understanding is consistent with the idea that the geometry of space is a consequence of "some small vibrating things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

## Information Paradox and Black Holes

Research on Hawking radiation relates to the information paradox concerning black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:07">[20:15:07]</a>. While classical general relativity suggests that information might disappear into a black hole's singularity, [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] states that it is impossible to completely annihilate information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:38">[21:47:38]</a>. Recent calculations, particularly from 2019, indicate that information does not disappear, and most theorists now believe it comes out of the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:18">[22:02:18]</a>. The information paradox is an emergent phenomenon resulting from black hole evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:44:07">[22:44:07]</a>. Modern research addresses these issues using language familiar to those in [[quantum_properties_and_their_applications | quantum computing]] and quantum information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:21">[23:01:21]</a>.

The "no hair theorem" in classical black hole theory states that a black hole is completely described by only three properties: electric charge, mass, and angular momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:43">[23:52:43]</a>. However, when [[quantum_mechanics_and_its_implications | quantum mechanics]] is considered in relation to black holes, this "no hair" claim is discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:44">[24:28:44]</a>. Quantum mechanics suggests that black holes are "more than just their spin, mass, and angular momentum," implying they possess additional information, akin to "hair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:37">[24:37:37]</a>.

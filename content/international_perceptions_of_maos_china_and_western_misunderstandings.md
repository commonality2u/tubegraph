During Mao Zedong's rule, perceptions of China in the West were often shaped by limited information, ideological leanings, and carefully managed propaganda. Jung Chang, in a podcast interview, discussed various facets of these Western misunderstandings and the context surrounding them.

## Sources of Misunderstanding

Western understanding of Mao's China was hampered by several factors, leading to a skewed or incomplete picture of the realities within the country.

### Limited Information and Propaganda
China under Mao was largely isolated from the outside world, making independent verification of information difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   Visitors, including some Westerners like a "deluded film star," were sometimes told by Chinese individuals (such as professors subjected to forced labor) that they enjoyed their hardships, claiming it turned them into "new men." Deng Xiaoping later bluntly stated, "They were lying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. These Westerners often took such statements at face value, unaware that people could not speak the truth freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.
*   The works of figures like Edgar Snow, an American journalist, influenced some Western academics and radicals in the 1960s, contributing to their illusions about Mao's regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.

### Ideological Sympathies and Wishful Thinking
A segment of Western society, including academics and young people, harbored illusions about Mao's China, partly fueled by a desire for an alternative to Western capitalism.
*   Mao's "Little Red Book" was, for a period, "in vogue" in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>.
*   Chang notes that some Westerners, discontented with their own societies, "so wanted for such miracle to happen" that they believed in what they might otherwise have rejected as fantasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>. This eagerness to find an alternative to Western capitalist democracy contributed to irrational beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:24">[01:15:24]</a>.
*   During the Cold War, when communism appeared to be a strong global force, there was considerable "wishful thinking" among Westerners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>. However, Chang suggests the younger generation in the West might be less "starry-eyed" due to revelations following the collapse of the Soviet Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>.

### Academic Defenses of Mao
Some Western academics actively defended Mao and his regime.
*   Chang mentions that even after her biography of Mao was published, some academics published a book of criticisms titled "Was Mao Really a Monster?", with a preface written by a senior lecturer at the London School of Economics (LSE) using Maoist language to describe Mao as a "great revolutionary" and "great Marxist-Leninist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
*   Chang expresses a lack of full understanding as to why these academics defend Mao, suggesting they might not know or care about the facts, or perhaps hold a view that China has always been "awful" and that "Orientals must feel differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.

## Notable Western Figures and Their Perceptions

### Henry Kissinger
Jung Chang offers a critical view of Henry Kissinger's interactions with Mao and his legacy:
*   She suggests Kissinger was "too fascinated with power," particularly Mao's ability to "turn the lives upside down of a quarter of... the world's population" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. Kissinger reportedly said "nice things about Mao" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a>.
*   Chang describes Kissinger attending rallies with figures like Bo Xilai that eulogized Mao, thereby lending his status to the Chinese regime's efforts to uphold Mao's legacy, an act she deems "unforgivable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>.

### Other Examples
*   A Western "steel magnet" (a major steel producer) reportedly thought Mao's backyard furnaces during the Great Leap Forward were a "brilliant idea," showcasing a profound misunderstanding of their catastrophic failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>.
*   The difficulty for Westerners to comprehend the godlike, unquestioning status Mao held in China was highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Challenging Misconceptions

### The Nixon-Kissinger "Opening" of China
Chang refutes the common Western narrative that Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger "opened up" China.
*   She states that their visits in 1971-1972 did not fundamentally open the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>.
*   Any relaxation or liberalization seen around that time was mainly due to internal Chinese politics, specifically the collapse of Lin Biao, which weakened Mao's control over the army, rather than Western diplomatic efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.
*   The true opening of China to the West, according to Chang, happened only after Mao's death in 1976 and under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, a process she personally experienced as one of the first students to leave China in 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>.

### Comparisons to Western Events
Chang strongly dismisses comparisons made by some in the West between events like the BLM movement and Mao's Cultural Revolution.
*   She asserts that such comparisons are "not at all comparable" and that the Cultural Revolution was "nothing like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:27">[01:29:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>.
*   She emphasizes that Westerners often cannot comprehend the true "horror," fear, and total societal destruction of the Cultural Revolution, which saw China become a cultural desert for ten years with no books, cinemas, or theaters, and widespread imprisonment and torture [[the_great_leap_forward_and_the_cultural_revolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:46">[01:29:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:12">[01:30:12]</a>.

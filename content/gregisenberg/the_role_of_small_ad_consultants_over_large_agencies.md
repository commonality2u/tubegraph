There is a significant gap in the market for "not douchy, non-agency companies" that assist others in running Facebook and Google Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While many businesses, especially startups, overlook the complexity of setting up even simple Google Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, a basic package of Meta Ads and Google Search Ads can be a "game changer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Why Small Ad Consultants are Preferred

The market for paid advertising services is often dominated by two extremes:
*   **Large Agencies** Agencies are typically too expensive, too big, and confusing for many businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Clients often report negative experiences, such as agencies seeming "scammy" or being unresponsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **"Douchy" Individuals** These are often perceived as 25-year-olds wearing gold Rolexes, which can be intimidating and untrustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This image is a turn-off for many, especially in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

This leaves a large, empty space for honest, approachable one-person ad consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a> who prioritize effectiveness over flashy self-promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Identifying Niche Markets for Ad Consultants

A successful small ad consultant should [[maximizing_agency_profits_through_specialized_niches | appeal to specific verticals]] and avoid the "douchy" stereotype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Examples of underserved niches include:
*   Hair salons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
*   Female product owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>
*   Creative Patreon accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>
*   Yoga retreats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>
*   Meditation and wellness spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>
*   Design events or creative retreats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>
*   Art installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>

The key is to work with products or services that align with one's understanding or interest, enabling the consultant to craft effective ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_pricing_and_client_acquisition | Strategies for Pricing and Client Acquisition]]

Instead of charging a monthly fee, consultants can adopt a revenue-sharing model, taking a percentage of each sale generated through their ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. This approach can be particularly appealing to clients, as it aligns incentives and reduces upfront risk.

For example, a consultant could:
1.  Identify events (like yoga retreats) that are not yet full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
2.  Contact the organizers to offer services, promising to fill events using Facebook Ads in exchange for a cut of every ticket sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
3.  Target event owners who "hate selling events" but "love putting on events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

This model is effective because it directly ties the consultant's compensation to the client's success, making it an "easy to start" business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

## Reconsidering the Effectiveness of Paid Ads

Many businesses believe that Meta Ads (Facebook/Instagram) are "dead" or ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This misconception often stems from personal experience or the perception that younger demographics have left these platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. However, Meta Ads perform exceptionally well for audiences over 40, who represent a significant portion of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

Not running paid ads is sometimes seen as a "status symbol" in "Ventureland" or Silicon Valley, where the focus is on "cutting-edge stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. This status game often doesn't apply to small businesses or traditional services like yoga retreats, for whom ads can be an "amazing easy way to start" <a class="yt>timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

## [[importance_of_paid_ads_for_business_growth | Importance of Paid Ads for Business Growth]]

[[paid_advertising_strategies_for_efficient_growth | Paid ads]] are essential for growing a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. For solopreneurs or small teams, ads are incredibly helpful because they allow for direct lead generation without massive branding campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. When ads feed into a simple funnel, they can directly lead to call bookings and, subsequently, clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

While starting with organic content to dial in messaging is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, learning to run ads as a discipline is crucial. It empowers businesses to generate leads actively rather than passively waiting for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

## [[leveraging_funnel_building_tools_for_agencies | Leveraging Funnel Building Tools]] and Conversion

Ad consultants focus on return on ad spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. For example, aiming to make $1.50 back for every $1 spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. This requires meticulous attention to the entire sales funnel, not just the landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

A typical funnel used by successful ad operations includes:
1.  **Facebook Ad** Selling the opt-in page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.
2.  **Opt-in Page** Offers something valuable (e.g., a free training video or downloadable lead magnet) in exchange for an email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. This page sells the idea of watching the video or getting the lead magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Tools like Framer (for aesthetics) or ClickFunnels (for ease of use) are used for building these pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.
3.  **Video Training** A free training session that pitches a call with a career coach at its conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>. This acts as a soft pitch by providing value and demonstrating expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
4.  **Call Booking** Leads to a calendar (e.g., Calendly) for booking free calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
5.  **Sales Team Interaction** The team handles the booked calls to convert leads into paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>.

One example shows that spending $86,000 on ads yielded $252,000 in revenue, a 38% return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.

### Funnels vs. Websites
The distinction between a website and a funnel is crucial:
*   A **website** is like a business card, showcasing what a company does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.
*   A **funnel** is a step-by-step process designed to convert a stranger into a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.

While direct conversion tracking (e.g., using tools like Hyros) can be complex, many marketers prioritize overall monthly profit and loss and trust that high-quality free content (a "shadow funnel") builds trust and aids conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.

### Copywriting Hacks for Conversion
Effective copywriting is vital for funnel success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>. Two key hacks include:
1.  **Status Appeal** Good copy often hints at how a product or service will increase someone's status among their peers. Even in corporate training, demonstrating increased value to colleagues enhances status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.
2.  **Pain vs. Pleasure** Copy can be framed to either move people *away from pain* or *towards pleasure* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>. During economic downturns, focusing on avoiding pain points is more effective, while in prosperous times, emphasizing positive outcomes (pleasure) works better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

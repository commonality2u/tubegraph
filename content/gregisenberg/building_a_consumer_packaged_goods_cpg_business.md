This article explores how to create a Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) business by leveraging data and [[trends_and_opportunities_in_consumer_markets | trends]]. Ashwin, an expert in launching and growing consumer brands, shares insights applicable to both physical products and software startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. He emphasizes using tools and software to identify ideas and opportunities, creating unfair advantages in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Evaluating Market Opportunities

Before building a product, it's crucial to evaluate demand and competition to avoid investing time and money into a product with no market demand or too much saturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Using Ahrefs for Demand & Competition
Ahrefs is a tool primarily used in the SEO world that allows users to type in any keyword and gauge its search volume on Google, as well as the difficulty of ranking for that term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

*   **Category Demand and Trends:** It helps assess overall category demand and seasonal trends. For example, "electrolytes" shows rising demand over years, with seasonal peaks in June and July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Keyword Difficulty:** A score from 0 to 100 indicates how hard it is to rank for a term. A high score (e.g., 88 for "electrolytes") suggests significant competition and a nearly impossible endeavor to rank in the top search results organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Geographical Opportunities:** Ahrefs can reveal where demand for a product is concentrated, highlighting opportunities in underserved regions. For instance, if electrolytes are popular in English-speaking Western countries but not elsewhere, there's an opportunity to build a brand like Element for Germany or India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This strategy mirrors how German tech startups replicated successful US business models in the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Analyzing Trends:** By examining historical search volume, one can understand why certain categories peaked and declined. For example, CBD's explosive growth in 2019 followed the 2018 Farm Bill, and its subsequent decline coincided with the rise of Delta-9 THC products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

### Using Particle for Competitor Sales & Best-selling SKUs
Particle is a tool for the physical product space that allows users to analyze any e-commerce brand to see their sales over time, product categories, and best-selling products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

*   **Competitive Analysis:** It provides insights into competitors' revenue and which specific products (SKUs) are driving most of their sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **De-risking Product Decisions:** By understanding what sells best, new brands can avoid costly mistakes by focusing on proven flavors or product variations. For example, if top players in a supplement category mainly sell chocolate and vanilla, a new brand should prioritize those <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Trend Exploration:** Particle also offers its own trend explorer and insights, showing how product categories are trending up or down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.
*   **Public Sales Data:** While Particle itself doesn't incorporate TikTok Shop data, platforms like TikTok Shop and Amazon often make sales figures public, allowing for direct observation of what's selling well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

## Differentiation Strategies

In crowded markets, differentiation is key to standing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

### Brand & Design
*   **Visual Distinction:** Many products in a category might look generic or medical. Creating a distinctive visual brand (e.g., Moon Juice's amber jar, Lemi's custom bottles and vibrant colors) can make a product stand out on a shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solution vs. Lifestyle:** For problem-solution oriented products (e.g., pimple patches), design can be straightforward and informative. For lifestyle brands (e.g., wine, alcohol), intentional and high-quality design is often critical to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

### Targeting Niche Audiences
*   **Hyper-targeted Positioning:** Early-stage businesses, whether software or physical products, should identify a specific niche and speak directly to them, then expand the niche later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.
*   **Underserved Demographics:** Many products are designed by and for specific demographics (e.g., millennials, Gen Z coastal urbanites), leading to market crowding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. Opportunities exist by applying successful product concepts to different, less-targeted demographics (e.g., pimple patches for older adults) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. Older demographics often have more disposable income and consume information from less saturated channels, making marketing easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

## Challenges and Advantages of CPG

### Why CPG is Hard
Building a CPG business is considered one of the hardest business models due to the numerous pieces required to be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. This includes:
*   Supply chain management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>
*   Maniacal financial control (cash conversion cycles, margins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>
*   Inventory forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>

### Why CPG is Beneficial
Despite the difficulty, building a CPG business in a low-stakes or low-risk way can be a phenomenal way to become proficient in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. The consumer product world is at the bleeding edge of marketing because it's so challenging to capture individual consumer attention and secure purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. This contrasts with B2B sales, where convincing a company to buy software is often easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. For more on this, see [[evaluating_consumer_versus_b2b_opportunities | evaluating consumer versus B2B opportunities]].

## Bootstrapping a CPG Business

It is possible to sketch out an idea and put something out there without investing significant capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.

### Leveraging Freelancers and Tools
*   **Independent Talent:** Instead of expensive agencies, founders can hire independent freelance designers from platforms like Fiverr and Upwork to create simple packaging design and landing pages for a few hundred or thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
*   **Testing Demand:** With basic design and a landing page, entrepreneurs can run ads (e.g., Facebook ads) to gauge demand before deeper investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.

### The Role of AI in Design
AI tools like Midjourney can generate initial design concepts (e.g., packaging prototypes) which can then be refined by a freelance designer for a minimal cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This approach allows founders to clarify their vision before engaging an agency, saving significant costs and ensuring alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. AI agents like Manis can also research competitors, analyze skincare needs for specific demographics, and generate product concepts, acting as a "research agent" to uncover opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>.

## The Importance of Distribution and Research

### Working Backwards from Distribution
A key takeaway for any founder, whether building software or physical products, is to start by working backwards from [[marketing_and_distribution_strategies_for_physical_products | distribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Focusing on customer acquisition channels where you can win, then building the product, is more effective than the reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. This aligns with the adage: "First-time founders focus on product, second-time founders focus on distribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>. Products that are subpar can still succeed with incredible distribution and operational excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.

### Relentless Research
Founders must be relentless researchers of their category and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. This involves:
*   Reading everything available about the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.
*   Analyzing competitors' branding, websites, and messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.
*   Talking to store owners or potential customers to understand what sells, what's not selling, and what people are looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.
*   For software, analyzing competitor reviews (especially one- and two-star reviews) and talking directly to potential users (e.g., dentists for dental CRM software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.

This in-depth research provides immense insight, builds confidence in the brand's direction, and moves beyond mere hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. Leveraging AI tools for this research is an "unfair advantage" that few people currently utilize to its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. There is no excuse to be ill-equipped or lack research on a category when tools can do it for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.

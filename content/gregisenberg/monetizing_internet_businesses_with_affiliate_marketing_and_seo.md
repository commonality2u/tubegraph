This article explores various trends and strategies for building and monetizing online businesses, with a particular focus on leveraging affiliate marketing and SEO. The insights are drawn from a conversation with Cody Schneider.

## Current Trends in Internet Businesses

Several key trends are identified as ripe for building successful online businesses:
*   **AI Landing Page Builders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **"Buy It For Life" (BIFL) products** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Viral formats on TikTok** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

These trends represent significant opportunities for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The "Buy It For Life" (BIFL) Trend

The "Buy It For Life" trend stems from an anti-consumerism sentiment, where individuals seek to purchase high-quality products designed to last multiple generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. A popular Reddit community dedicated to this trend allows users to ask for recommendations on durable products across various categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The popularity of this movement is growing, with 69,000 searches for "buy it for life" in the past month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Business Opportunities in BIFL

### The Directory Model
There is a significant opportunity to create a more user-friendly directory of BIFL products, moving beyond the current "surfing Craigslist" feel of existing community lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This improved directory could feature:
*   **Filters and enhanced aesthetics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Exact match domain names** such as `buyitforlife.com` or `buyitforlifeproducts.com` to optimize for search engine rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, which are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

Building such a directory can be done relatively simply using tools like WordPress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> or other AI-powered builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Monetization Strategies for BIFL
*   **Affiliate Marketing:** By driving traffic to retailers like Nordstrom or Walmart for BIFL products, the directory can earn an [[affiliate_programs_and_revenue_generation | affiliate commission]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Sale Alerts/Notifications:** Users would pay for alerts when desired BIFL products go on sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This involves scraping major retailers for price drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Newsletter:** Start with a newsletter to deliver sale information, potentially evolving into a full platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Display Ads:** Placing display ads via companies like MediaVine on the site can generate revenue from traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Traffic Generation via SEO and Community Engagement
*   **Programmatic SEO:** Create landing pages for long-tail keywords identified using tools like Semrush, such as "buy it for life vacuum," "buy it for life couch," etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Backlinks:** Build backlinks to these pages to improve search rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Reddit Engagement:** Provide value on the BIFL subreddit by sharing curated lists, then subtly linking back to the directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This can generate free traffic and newsletter subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Newsletter for Local Businesses:** Similar to how local newsletters gain subscribers from Reddit by providing value (e.g., "20 things to do this weekend in Toronto") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, a BIFL newsletter could attract subscribers. Strategically posting early in the morning and using Reddit upvotes can help posts hit the front page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

### Competition and Validation
The existence of competitors, such as `buyforlife.com` (which has ~2,000 monthly traffic), serves as validation for the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Competition indicates a large market, similar to how many window cleaning companies can coexist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Google Trends and Semrush can validate market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## Programmatic SEO and Tool-Based Monetization

### Job Description Generator Example
A relevant example of this strategy is the purchase of `jobdescriptiongenerator.com` for $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. The strategy involves:
1.  **Exact Match Domain:** Acquiring a domain that precisely matches a high-volume search term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
2.  **Branded Searches:** Google increasingly prioritizes websites with branded searches, indicating they are "real companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
3.  **Tool-Based Homepage:** The homepage features an AI tool (e.g., a job description generator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. This tool naturally generates backlinks as people use it and share it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
4.  **Long-Tail Landing Pages:** Build thousands of blog posts and landing pages for related long-tail keywords (e.g., "job description templates for every job") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.
5.  **Monetization:** Primarily through display ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>, or by driving traffic to other services, such as a talent sourcing agency for those looking to hire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.

This approach leverages branded searches and tool-generated backlinks to build domain authority, allowing for the creation of vast amounts of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. This is a significant opportunity for first-time online business starters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

## AI Landing Page Builders

This trend focuses on tools that can automatically generate landing page templates based on a brand's aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. Current tools often fall short, being either full website builders or lacking easy deployment to subdomains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

### The Opportunity
The ideal tool would allow users to chat with it (like Cursor) to create templates and then easily duplicate and modify them for various campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. This product would primarily target digital marketing agencies running paid ads or anyone running display or Google Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

### Market Validation
Despite large players like Shopify and Webflow launching AI assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>, the market for landing page builders is massive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. The rapid growth of companies like Perspective (.co), which reached $10 million ARR in three years as a bootstrapped company focusing on mobile-first funnels, validates the demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. Big players moving into the space also signals strong market interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

### Monetization and Marketing
*   **Subscription Model:** Selling the software as a service.
*   **Google Ads:** Running ads for "landing page builder" keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   **YouTube Sponsorships:** Sponsoring YouTubers who create content on Google Ads or digital marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

## TikTok Template Trend

This trend involves identifying and leveraging viral TikTok formats and templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.

### Business Idea: Viral Format Newsletter
An email newsletter could be built to provide:
*   Weekly or daily updates on viral TikTok formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.
*   Guidance on how brands can adapt and use these formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.
*   Integration with an editor to easily create custom versions of the templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

### Monetization of the Newsletter
*   **Paid Subscriptions:** Offer a free version (e.g., weekly) and a paid version (e.g., daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Marketing:** Potentially recommend tools or services for content creation.
*   **Display Ads:** If the newsletter grows significantly.

### Traffic Generation
*   **Twitter Threads:** Create viral Twitter threads showcasing "5 formats going viral on TikTok this week" with breakdowns and a call to action to subscribe to the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>. This strategy has proven effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

## General Advice on Starting Internet Businesses

*   **Embrace Competition:** The existence of competitors validates a market opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Online businesses, like traditional ones, can coexist and thrive in large categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Anti-Boring Businesses:** Focus on building dynamic online companies rather than traditional "boring businesses" like coin laundries, especially in the current "Gold Rush" era of online opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage AI Tools:** It's easier than ever to build online companies using AI tools like Perplexity, which can provide step-by-step guides for creation (e.g., building a WordPress site) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.
*   **Speed of Execution:** Companies can be live and generating traffic within an hour, using tools like Replit for application building and social media for initial reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.
*   **Audience Building:** Building an audience is a massive leverage point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. Consistently showing up and creating content, such as writing 70 tweets every Sunday, can lead to significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Iteration:** Be agnostic to what works and let the data guide decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. Experiment, see what performs best, and then double down on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. This applies to content formats across different platforms like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.
*   **Constant Reinvention:** Stay flexible and be willing to switch up formats and iterate on the fly based on what resonates with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.

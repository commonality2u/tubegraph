Newsletters are presented as a "cheat code" or "hack" for starting a profitable business from scratch in 2025 [00:00:19]. They allow creators to gather a loyal group of people and serve as a foundation to build various ventures like marketplaces, agencies, or software businesses [00:00:41]. This article explores several newsletter business ideas, focusing on both niche and local opportunities, based on insights from Matt McGary, an expert in email subscribers [00:00:54].

## Why Newsletters are a Strong Startup Idea
Newsletters are highlighted as a simple way to start a business that doesn't require significant initial investment [00:37:11]. They can serve as the foundation for larger ventures, including agencies, software businesses, or marketplaces [00:37:11]. The model allows for consistent customer acquisition through paid ads (e.g., Facebook ads) and organic growth via social media, leading to a growing audience and revenue [00:37:26].

## Niche Newsletter Business Ideas

### 1. Marketing Newsletter for Global Talent
This idea targets the growing shift towards overseas talent [00:01:46].
*   **Concept**: Create a newsletter specifically for overseas marketers seeking remote USA-based marketing jobs [00:02:33].
*   **Problem Addressed**: A skill gap exists because overseas marketers often work with significantly smaller budgets than Western marketers, limiting their experience [00:02:18].
*   **Content Structure**:
    *   Section 1: Great remote marketing jobs for readers to apply to [00:03:19].
    *   Section 2: Relevant digital marketing news and updates [00:03:25].
    *   Section 3: Actionable digital marketing tutorials [00:03:29].
*   **Subscriber Acquisition**: In places like India, subscribers can be acquired for 25 to 50 cents each through Facebook ads [00:02:45]. A budget of $5,000/month could yield 20,000 new subscribers monthly [00:02:53].
    *   [!WARNING] The speaker notes that these may be "low-quality subs" for direct monetization, meaning the monetization strategy needs to target a different audience [00:03:00].
*   **[[How to monetize newsletters | Monetization]]**: The primary monetization strategy is to target Western audiences looking to hire talented overseas marketers [00:03:52].
    *   **Job Board**: Create a free job board where companies can post jobs, charging $300-$500 for boosted listings or featured jobs in the newsletter [00:04:00].
    *   **Sponsored Email Blasts**: By collecting subscriber data like work experience, job title, company, and skills, targeted email blasts can be sent on behalf of recruiters, charging $1,000-$3,000 per blast [00:04:50].
    *   **[[Partnerships and collaborations in newsletter businesses | Partnership]] with Recruiting Agency**: Partner with or create an overseas recruiting agency [00:05:09]. Partnering is suggested as more feasible, using the newsletter to generate leads for the agency (e.g., Nick Huber and Somewhere.com) [00:05:23].
    *   **Course Creation**: Create a course focused on the international audience of marketers [00:05:53].
*   **Financial Projections (Example)**: With a $0.25 CPA and $5,000/month budget, acquiring 20,000 new subscribers monthly:
    *   Job board: 5 jobs/newsletter at $300/job = $1,500 per issue [00:06:14]. Sending 3 newsletters/week = $18,000/month [00:06:21].
    *   Recruiting blasts: 5 blasts/month at $2,000/each = $10,000/month [00:06:29].
    *   Total potential revenue: $28,000/month with an audience of 20,000-40,000 international marketers [00:06:37].

### 2. Platform-Based Newsletter
This idea leverages popular tools and platforms.
*   **Concept**: Create an educational newsletter instructing people on how to use specific tools or platforms better [00:08:26].
*   **Example**: Mix XL, who made learning Excel fun and expanded to Word and PowerPoint [00:07:55].
*   **Content**: Focus on one specific tool or platform (e.g., Ableton, DaVinci, Notion, Canva, Figma, Klaviyo, Perplexity AI) [00:08:31]. Make content digestible and delightful [00:08:44].
*   **[[How to monetize newsletters | Monetization]]**:
    *   **Affiliate Marketing**: Become an affiliate partner for the platform, earning 20-50% recurring commissions on customer referrals [00:09:21].
    *   **Templates/Digital Assets**: Create and sell templates related to the platform (e.g., a HubSpot template for $200) [00:10:01].
    *   **Courses**: Build a course around mastering the platform [00:09:06].
    *   **Sponsorships**: Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) tools within the platform's ecosystem would be interested in advertising to your readers [00:10:39].
    *   **Build Your Own Tools**: With AI, creators can build their own SaaS tools to sell to their audience [00:10:50].

### 3. Niche Ad Examples for Media Buyers
This caters to professionals who need to stay updated on advertising trends.
*   **Concept**: Curate and break down high-converting ad examples for specific niches for media buyers [00:24:51].
*   **Content Structure**:
    *   Create a spreadsheet to determine target niches [00:25:24].
    *   Source high-converting ads from platforms like Meta Ad Library (look for long-running ads from high-spending accounts) [00:25:30].
    *   Select 3-6 ads per niche and add 1-2 sentences of context to each [00:25:43].
    *   Break down the newsletter into 3-4 sections, each featuring ads from a different niche [00:25:18].
*   **[[How to monetize newsletters | Monetization]]**:
    *   **Paid Wall**: Put 80% of the content behind a paywall [00:25:57].
    *   **Canva Templates**: Create downloadable Canva templates for each ad example [00:26:03].
    *   **Sponsorships**: Sell sponsorships to advertisers targeting paid marketers [00:26:03].
    *   **Community/Membership/Course**: Sell access to a community, membership, or course for the audience [00:26:08].

### 4. Industry-Specific AI Tips and Tactics
This idea leverages the growing interest in AI for practical application.
*   **Concept**: Modelled after "Write With AI," this involves training readers on how to use AI for specific categories (e.g., AI for marketers, AI for lawyers) [00:29:14].
*   **Content**: Weekly delivery of AI prompts and tips [00:29:20]. The key is to provide "cheat codes" that help readers save time and money with AI tools and tactics [00:29:46].
*   **[[How to monetize newsletters | Monetization]]**: Primarily through paid subscriptions (e.g., $200/year or $20/month like "Write With AI") [00:29:28].
    *   [!WARNING] The speaker notes that "Write With AI" had hundreds of thousands of social media followers before launching, raising the question of whether this model is viable without an existing large audience [00:30:07].

### 5. Lessons from Leaders or Inspirational Figures
This idea focuses on [[Community and personal development via newsletters | personal development]] through curated wisdom.
*   **Concept**: Feature highlights and lessons learned from inspirational leaders [00:31:01].
*   **Content**: Keep the newsletter short (2-5 minutes max) [00:31:50]. For a niche like investors, profiling Warren Buffett could include sections like:
    *   Best interview with Warren Buffett [00:31:55].
    *   Best quote from Warren Buffett [00:32:02].
    *   Best book about Warren Buffett [00:32:02].
    *   Best piece of advice from Warren Buffett [00:32:02].
    *   Focus on predictable formats with short, actionable content [00:32:07].
*   **Growth**: This content translates well to social media (especially X), which can drive viral growth [00:31:21]. Facebook targeting can be used for people who like specific figures or follow related companies (e.g., Berkshire Hathaway) [00:32:25].
*   **[[How to monetize newsletters | Monetization]]**: This is trickier due to a less clear niche [00:31:08]. However, if focused on a "prosumer" audience (e.g., investors interested in Warren Buffett):
    *   **Raise a Fund**: Act as a mini-Warren Buffett and raise a hedge fund from the audience [00:33:19].
    *   **Consulting Agency**: Offer consulting on "how Warren Buffett would run your company" [00:33:37].
    *   **Courses**: Sell courses [00:33:44].
    *   **Stock Trading App/AI Agent**: Create a stock trading app or an AI agent focused on value investing, charging for portfolio optimization advice [00:33:54].

### General Niche Newsletter Strategy: B2B Decision Makers
This strategy targets high-value audiences.
*   **Concept**: Create a newsletter for B2B decision-makers in a very specific industry niche [00:20:49].
*   **Advantage**: A small audience (e.g., 2,000 subscribers) of C-suite executives can be extremely valuable because sponsors are desperate to reach them [00:20:56].
*   **Acquiring Subscribers**:
    *   **Direct Outreach/Networking**: Chat with executives in target industries, ask about their "info diet," and create content specifically for them. Ask for introductions to their network [00:21:28].
    *   **Hyper-Relevant Content**: Summarize important press releases, product launches, executive hires/fires, and earning reports into a 5-10 minute newsletter [00:21:53].
    *   **Social Media**: Share content on LinkedIn and X to drive people to the newsletter [00:22:04].
    *   **Cross-Promotions/Advertising**: Advertise in other newsletters read by the target ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) or do cross-promotions [00:22:15].
*   **Data Enrichment**: Crucial for monetization. Use survey forms (e.g., Beehiiv) after subscription to ask for job title, industry, company, and location [00:22:28].
    *   This data allows you to prove to sponsors that a high percentage of subscribers fit their ICP, increasing leverage for sales [00:22:52].
*   **[[How to monetize newsletters | Monetization]]**:
    *   **Sponsorships**: High-value sponsors will pay to reach decision-makers [00:21:09].
    *   **Software/Products**: Develop and sell software or other products directly to this audience [00:23:35].
    *   **Events/Courses**: Organize events or sell courses targeted at decision-makers [00:23:48].

## Local Newsletter Business Ideas

### 1. Local Real Estate Investor Newsletter
This model has proven success in the real estate industry.
*   **Concept**: A newsletter for local real estate investors looking to invest in a specific city (ideal for cities with 200,000 to 1 million people) [00:13:30].
*   **Content**:
    *   Discover best investment properties via Zillow or local realtors (can be outsourced or automated with AI) [00:13:50].
    *   Include 10-20 high-quality listings per newsletter [00:14:00].
    *   Enrich listings with potential mortgage rates and forecasted returns [00:14:07].
    *   Examples: "The Offer Sheet" and "Here.co" for Airbnb properties [00:14:18].
*   **Growth**:
    *   **Facebook Ads**: Build subscriber list with a CPA of $2 or less [00:14:29].
    *   **Local Groups/Subreddits**: Promote the newsletter in local Facebook groups and subreddits by adding value and then linking out [00:14:34].
    *   **Social Media CTAs**: Use pre- and post-call-to-actions (CTAs) on social media to tease content and drive newsletter sign-ups (e.g., Matt McGary's Twitter ad example) [00:15:01].
    *   **Organic Growth**: Focus on building an audience on one social media platform (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, X) to reduce reliance on paid ads over time [00:16:28].
*   **Monetization**:
    *   **Ad Sales**: Start selling ad spots with 1,000-5,000 subscribers [00:17:18]. Approach local businesses (lawyers, accountants, bankers, insurance brokers) [00:18:05].
        *   Example: Agree to 500 clicks at $5/click for an upfront fee of $2,500. This revenue can be reinvested into acquiring more subscribers [00:17:31].
    *   **In-Person Seminars/Events**: Sell seats ($500-$1,000) for local real estate investment seminars [00:18:29].
    *   **Premium Subscriptions**: Put 50% of property listings behind a paywall for $1,000/year [00:18:40].
*   **Financial Projections (Example)**: With a $2 CPA and $5,000/month budget (2,500 new paid subs/month) + 600 organic subs/month = 3,100 new subs/month total [00:18:50].
    *   Ad sales: 3 ads at $2,500 each = $7,500/month [00:19:15].
    *   Seminars: 2% conversion of 5,000 subs at $500/seat = $50,000 in sales [00:19:23].
    *   Premium Subs: 1% conversion of 5,000 subs at $1,000/year = $50,000 ARR [00:19:38].
    *   Total potential revenue: $190,000/year with 5,000-10,000 subscribers [00:19:45].
*   **Scalability**: Once stable, replicate the model in nearby cities [00:18:12]. This audience is highly sought-after, making the business potentially sellable [00:19:54].

### 2. General Local Newsletters
This idea aims to fill a gap in local news.
*   **Concept**: Create digestible, positive, community-oriented local newsletters, countering the crime-heavy focus of traditional media [00:34:34].
*   **Example**: "Things to Do This Weekend" newsletter, sent on Thursday mornings, highlighting local events, live music, food, and fun [00:34:58].
    *   [!TIP] Source events not typically found online, like those on chalkboards in cafes [00:35:02].
*   **Subscriber Acquisition**:
    *   **Facebook Ads**: Simple ads (e.g., "Here are five restaurants to try this weekend in Miami") linking to a landing page can acquire subscribers for less than 50 cents [00:35:24].
*   **[[How to monetize newsletters | Monetization]]**:
    *   **Local Sponsorships**: Target high Lifetime Value (LTV) businesses such as lawyers, realtors, and wealth managers [00:35:59].
*   **Scalability**: Can grow to six-figure businesses in one city and expand to seven figures by entering multiple cities [00:36:03].
*   **Examples of Success**:
    *   Naptown Scoop (Annapolis, Maryland) generates $400K/year [00:36:14].
    *   6 AM City grew to $8 million in revenue with 1.4 million subscribers [00:36:27].
    *   The Charlotte Agenda was acquired by Axios for approximately $5 million [00:36:39].
    *   [!TIP] The key is to keep content positive, community-oriented, and curated, offering an "anti-AI" experience in a world flooded with content [00:36:48].

## Other Newsletter Ideas (Briefly Mentioned)

*   **Unofficial Sports Team Newsletter**: Focus on teams with large fan bases but limited media coverage (e.g., local, minor league, college teams) [00:11:43]. Content can be sourced from subreddits/forums or by inviting community contributions [00:11:59].
    *   **Monetization**: Sponsors, paid Discord/Facebook Community [00:12:34].
    *   [!WARNING] Requires a dozen newsletters for multiple teams to generate serious revenue [00:12:39].
*   **"This Week in Memes" Newsletter**: Explain news with memes and concise summaries [00:26:55].
    *   **Concept**: Newsletters are becoming more visual in 2025 [00:28:17]. Memes, infographics, and GIFs can make content less "work" to consume [00:28:27].
    *   **Content**: Cover 2-4 stories per day/week, each with a meme and 100-250 word summary [00:27:27]. Memes can be sourced from Reddit, Twitter, etc. [00:27:36].
    *   **Target Audience**: Prosumer niches like business, tech, investing, or finance offer more [[How to monetize newsletters | monetization]] opportunities [00:27:45]. General news is also possible [00:27:52].
    *   **Monetization**: More prosumer/B2B content generally leads to higher monetization potential [00:28:03].

By focusing on specific niches or local communities, newsletters can be a strong foundation for building profitable and scalable businesses [00:37:00].

This article outlines how to create viral content using generative AI and explores various [[monetization_strategies_beyond_ads | monetization strategies]] for it, based on the insights of PJ, an expert in AI film creation who consistently achieves viral success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Power of AI in Content Creation

The current digital landscape is overwhelmed with content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Generative AI is poised to increase this deluge tenfold or even a hundredfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. In this environment, the ability to understand *why* people engage with and share content is more crucial than the technical skill to create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

Creating cinematic content with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google V3 has become accessible even for non-technical users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The primary goal is to create entertaining content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## PJ's Process for Viral AI Commercials

PJ's method for creating viral AI films, such as a satirical pharmaceutical commercial, follows a structured approach:

### 1. Ideation: The Kernel of an Idea
The process begins with an unexpected "kernel of an idea hook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. For the viral pharmaceutical ad, the initial concept was a placebo pill that led to a dog delivery, which then evolved into a pheromone-secreting pill attracting puppies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The goal is to avoid "cinematic blasé garbage" that looks good but lacks soul or uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### 2. Scripting with LLMs
PJ uses LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok (especially Grok's "unhinged mode") for scripting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Initial Prompting:** Start with generalized instructions to get a cliché baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. For the ad, the prompt included specific requirements: a fake medication for depression with "pup" in the name, resembling a real medication, following a 20-second commercial format, starting with people battling depression, then trying the pill, and ending with a puppy delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:08:17]</a>. It's crucial to specify an SNL-style satirical take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Extract the best lines and repeatedly prompt the AI to generate more, feeding back favorite lines to refine the comedic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:22]</a>. About 70% of the lines in PJ's viral ad were generated by ChatGPT, but through this iterative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   **Outsourcing "Taste":** If unsure about comedic style, specify a comedian (e.g., Seth Rogen, Bill Burr) or show (e.g., Tim and Eric Show, Deep Thoughts with Jack Handey) to guide the AI's tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

### 3. Video Generation with Google V3
Once the script is refined, each dialogue line is converted into a prompt for Google V3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **Prompt Structure:** Use a simple prompt structure that describes the scene, dialogue, pose, shot type, camera type, and background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:18:00]</a>. ChatGPT can extrapolate these detailed prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   **V3 Usage:** Use the highest quality model (VO3) and generate one output per prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:27]</a>. Running one shot at a time is recommended due to cost (approximately $2-3 per shot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **Audio & Consistency:** V3 generates audio directly from the prompt's dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:24]</a>. However, audio quality can be "thin," and voice consistency across shots is lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:51]</a>. Character consistency is also a challenge as V3 is primarily text-to-video, not image-to-video, so detailed descriptions are needed for similar-looking characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:20:50]</a>. Avoid including quotes in prompts to reduce gibberish subtitles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **Cost & Time:** The pharmaceutical commercial cost about $500 in V3 credits and took 6-12 hours to create, a stark contrast to traditional shoots that could cost hundreds of thousands to a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:47]</a>.

### 4. Editing
PJ uses Final Cut Pro, but CapCut and DaVinci Resolve are also viable options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:35]</a>. It often takes a 3:1 or 5:1 ratio of generated clips to good ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:52]</a>. Incorporating camera movements in prompts (e.g., dolly in) can make the shots feel less AI-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:23]</a>. Granular details, like a character's emotion or a specific object in the background, can be prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:23:02]</a>.

### 5. The "Hook" for Going Viral
After production, the critical step is to craft a compelling hook for social media. On platforms like X (formerly Twitter), the headline is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:58]</a>. The funnel is: headline > thumbnail > video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:35]</a>.

PJ's viral hooks:
*   **Provocative Statement:** "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials. I made this for $500 in V3 credits in less than a day. What's the argument for spending 500K now? Steal my prompt below." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:27:00]</a>
    *   This combines a "low-key flex," trending AI technology (V3), a striking cost comparison ($500k vs. $500), and a call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:50]</a>.
*   **Leverage Trends:** "AI video quality just 10xed overnight. I'm speechless. Cling 2.0 just dropped and I've already burned through $1,200 in credits testing its limits. I've never seen motion this fluid or this accurate. Here's how I made this video step by step." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:32]</a>
*   **Behind-the-Scenes & Cost Transparency:** "What if Studio Gibli directed Lord of the Rings? I spent 250 in cling credits and 9 hours editing the Fellowship trailer. And I'll show you exactly how I did it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:47]</a>
*   **Avoid Clichés:** While phrases like "Hollywood is cooked" can work, find unique variations for a provocative statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:26]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies for AI Content

AI-generated content opens numerous business opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Here are several [[monetization_strategies_beyond_ads | strategies for monetizing content]] created with V3 and similar tools:

### 1. Build a Personal Brand
Use AI tools to create content that builds a personal brand and establishes expertise. This can lead to downstream work and attracts an audience that trusts you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:45:00]</a>. This is a key [[building_a_personal_brand_through_viral_videos | strategy for building a personal brand through viral videos]].

### 2. Attract Direct Clients
Create specific types of commercials (e.g., for food products, beer companies, underwear brands) and pitch them directly to businesses or agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:33:14]</a>. Agencies are often unable to achieve these "unhinged special effects" within typical budgets, making AI a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:27]</a>. Charge based on your skill as a filmmaker, not just the low cost of AI credits (e.g., $5,000 minimum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:59]</a>.

### 3. Build a Portfolio for Agencies
Create a portfolio of diverse or niche AI-generated commercials. For beginners, it's advised to focus on a specific niche that aligns with personal interests (e.g., knife commercials, then adjacent products like boots) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:35:05]</a>.
*   **"Steal Like an Artist":** Take screenshots of award-winning commercials, prompt an LLM to break them into V3 prompts, and then generate similar shots for your portfolio. This helps with pacing and flow, allowing you to copy "the greats" and develop your unique voice over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:36:04]</a>.

### 4. Create Narrative Series with Brand Integrations
Develop a narrative universe or series and integrate brands directly into the storyline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:25]</a>. For example, Neural Viz's "moniverse" features aliens discovering and interacting with human artifacts, which could be product placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:38:34]</a>. This approach leverages popular social formats (e.g., "Man on the Street," "House Hunters") with an AI-driven twist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:39:17]</a>.

### 5. Sell Courses or Digital Products
Bundle knowledge into courses, PDFs, or other digital products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:40:03]</a>. While common for marketers, it's a valid way to monetize expertise.

### 6. Consulting for Larger Companies
Offer consulting services to Fortune 500 and other companies on integrating generative AI, ensuring legal compliance and security procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:41]</a>. Pricing should scale with the size of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:09]</a>.

### 7. Build a Sketch Comedy Channel
Create a sketch comedy show using AI. While monetization can be harder, a large enough audience (like on TikTok) can attract brand integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:46]</a>.

### 8. Narrative Films (with caution)
Producing narrative films is possible (e.g., a 25-minute TV show) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:53]</a>. However, PJ advises against long-form content (e.g., 90-minute features) with generative AI because the technology iterates too fast, potentially making early parts of a film look outdated by the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:08]</a>. Prioritize episodic weekly content, which aligns with modern consumption habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:29]</a>.

### 9. Pitch Brands on Narrative Content
Instead of traditional commercials, pitch brands on creating entire narrative series (e.g., 10-episode, 2-minute series) where their product is integrated as a central element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:24]</a>.

### 10. Target Small Sub-Niches
Identify underserved niches with high demand and low supply of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:52]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Faith-based content:** Bible stories are "open-sourced IP" with billions of daily active users, representing a huge market with high demand and low supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:44:14]</a>.
*   **Book promos/Romantasy:** Create book promos or scenes from romantic fantasy books for authors, a viral and lucrative niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:46:02]</a>. This represents an underserved niche that can now afford high-level cinematography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:37]</a>.

Ultimately, the best advice is to create content that fascinates you, copy successful frameworks, and apply them to unique niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:28]</a>.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the landscape of mobile app marketing, particularly in the realm of ad creation and optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach allows businesses to scale their advertising efforts efficiently and achieve profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## The Paid Ads Strategy
One of the primary ways to grow a mobile app is through a paid ads strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This involves creating effective advertisements for platforms like Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads, and Google Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Why Scale Ad Creation with AI?
Traditionally, creating a high volume of diverse ads to find winning formats has been extremely costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. However, AI significantly reduces this cost and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.

Successful companies are known to test thousands, even tens of thousands, of ad creatives to identify the most profitable angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. For instance, a Turkish company called Cway, known for its "Picture This" plant identifier app, has tested approximately 30,000 different ad videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. This massive scale of testing was previously feasible mainly for large gaming studios like Candy Crush, who could easily produce ad creatives from game screen recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>. AI now makes this extensive testing accessible to a broader range of mobile app companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.

### AI's Role in Ad Production
[[using_ai_for_ad_creation_and_strategy | AI-powered tools]] allow for the creation of ads entirely from a computer, eliminating the need for actors or elaborate productions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.

The process often involves:
1.  **Scripting:** Writing the ad copy and dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. For a plant identifier app, a script might begin with a relatable problem, like "I always have issues finding the best plant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.
2.  **Actor Selection:** Choosing from a library of virtual actors that match desired demographics (age, situation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.
3.  **Video Generation:** Generating the video with the chosen actor speaking the script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.
4.  **Editing and Integration:** Adding app screenshots, removing backgrounds, and combining elements using video editing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

This streamlined process allows for the rapid generation of multiple ad variations (e.g., 20 different angles in an hour) to test which performs best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

## Localization for Expanded Reach
Once an ad strategy proves successful in an initial market like the US, [[using_ai_for_ad_creation_and_strategy | AI can facilitate localization]] for other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. This involves translating ads into different languages (e.g., Spanish, French) and adapting them for specific cultural contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.

For example, a cleaning or storage app might localize its ads for Turkish people, making the app more appealing to that specific market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>. This allows companies to tap into new opportunities and expand their reach globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>.

## Impact on Profitability
By enabling rapid iteration and testing of ads, [[optimizing_ad_return_and_profitability_with_ai | AI contributes significantly to optimizing ad return and profitability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. This systematic approach helps identify winning ad creatives that drive higher conversion rates and downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.

> "The opportunity I see here for mobile apps is that now with AI, you can do the same strategy that they did in gaming, which is you create all of your ads from a computer, you basically think about like the ad and you don't need to hire an actor, you don't need to talk to anyone to make it happen, you can do everything with like a tool like Arc Ads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.

The ability to create hundreds or thousands of ads rapidly and affordably is a game-changer for mobile app studios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

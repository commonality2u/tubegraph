The traditional marketing funnel is an "entirely wrong way to think about [[modern_marketing_strategies | modern marketing]]" because it's deceptive and doesn't reflect how people actually buy things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Instead of a linear funnel, a new concept called "digital gravity" offers a more accurate visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Digital Gravity

Digital gravity proposes that companies and brands should aim to [[branding_and_marketing_strategies_for_products | build digital mass]] on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The more digital mass a brand accumulates, the greater its influence within its niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This mass is built primarily through content and marketing across all platforms where customers are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Customers interact with a brand, move away, then get "sucked back in" through multiple rotations before finally making a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This concept applies to local businesses, B2B, and consumer markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. As a brand grows in mass, more people get "sucked into that orbit," leading to more "touchdowns" (revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This creates a growth flywheel where revenue is reinvested to [[branding_and_marketing_strategies_for_products | build more mass]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Marketing Resources

The approach to building digital mass varies based on a company's funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>:
*   **Funded Companies**: Have abundant money, time, and resources, allowing them to market "everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapped Companies**: Often have more time and mental energy but less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Continuous Marketing vs. Campaigns

The traditional "campaign" mindset, originating from military terminology, suggests a start and end to marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. However, in the modern digital landscape, marketing is continuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Companies should constantly create content to add mass to their brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, continuously running ads and testing for the cheapest cost-per-click (CPC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The only marketing element that isn't malleable once sent is email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## B2B Marketing Playbook

Growing a B2B company involves a straightforward framework focused on consistent activity and layering growth curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### 1. Target Audience Identification
*   **Scrape Emails**: For a smaller target audience (e.g., 50,000 people), scrape their emails using tools like Apollo.io or even LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### 2. Ad Strategies
*   **Custom Match Lists**: Import scraped emails into ad platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads to run targeted ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Facebook typically matches 30-40% of emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **[[ai_agents_in_marketing | AI Avatar Ads]]**: Use [[tips_for_effective_aidriven_marketing_strategies | tools]] like HeyGen for avatars and Eleven Labs for voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Create 100 variations of ads addressing customer pain points, testing different hooks, settings, and backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
    *   **Founder as Avatar**: Founders can make a digital clone of themselves to appear in ads, leveraging personal branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. People buy from people, not brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
    *   **Ad Allocation**: Allocate 80% of the budget to the best-performing ads (lowest CPC) and 20% for continuous testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

### 3. Cold Emailing
*   **Separate Domains**: For cold email, use separate domains from your core transactional email domain to prevent "nuking" your main domain if flagged for aggressive sending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **Tools**: Utilize Mail Reef for specialized AWS servers (sending 50,000 emails for about $400/month) and Smartlead.ai or Instantly AI ($89/month) to manage multiple email accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **Messaging**: Emails should be problem-solution oriented, similar to ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Aim to land as much email as possible in inboxes to create surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Cold email "100% works" if messaging is specific and provides value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

### 4. Content and Media Strategy
*   **Podcast Creation**: Record customer conversations to generate valuable, industry-specific content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. This can be turned into a podcast and sent out as a newsletter to the scraped email list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
    *   **Newsletter Tools**: MailerLite and Beehiiv are effective for sending newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
    *   **Media Leverage**: A podcast can transform a company into a media entity, creating leverage for negotiations (e.g., Rupa Health used its podcast to negotiate better deals with lab companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Turn the media arm into a profit center by selling ad placements on the podcast and in the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. This can subsidize growth costs, leading to "negative CAC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
    *   Companies like Aero Electronics, Red Bull, and Y Combinator operate as media companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
*   **Content Repurposing**: Use [[ai_agents_in_marketing | AI tools]] like Swell AI to transcribe podcasts, extract pain points, create clips, show notes, blog posts, and white papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   **Social Media Distribution**: Schedule content across all relevant platforms (LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
    *   **LinkedIn**: Short-form content from TikTok or Instagram Reels can go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
    *   **Instagram Ads**: Run "Instagram-only ads" with a call to action to follow the account for more content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. Aim for impressions to drive profile follows (e.g., 30 cents per follower) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. The larger the account, the more free impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
    *   **Content vs. Ads**: The goal is to create ads that feel like native content on the platform, blending entertainment and education, to reduce costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

### Overall B2B Strategy
Combining these tactics creates a powerful system: massive ad remarketing, targeted top-of-funnel ads, a weekly email list with a podcast, podcast ad revenue, social media channels posting daily, and cold email outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. This "grindy" but not "hard" work can take a company from non-existent to industry recognition in 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.

For example, a company gained 130,000 email subscribers and drove 80,000 website clicks per month from a newsletter costing only $450, compared to traditional ad costs of $500,000 for the same traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.

## Consumer Marketing Playbook

Consumer marketing is a "different animal" and "so much more competitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. Success requires exceptional marketing skills, but winning in consumer can be extremely rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>.

### 1. Total Addressable Market (TAM)
*   **Huge TAM**: A large total addressable market is essential for consumer products, as content needs to be broad enough to target a significant population subset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.

### 2. App Strategy
*   **Single-Purpose Apps**: Focus on [[building_apps_with_a_strong_consumer_brand | building applications]] that do one thing well for a large audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
*   **Pricing Tactics**: Charging $7.99 a week (translating to about $29 a month) can work as an impulse purchase, providing three months of revenue from a $10 customer acquisition cost (CAC), resulting in a 10x payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.
*   **Ebook Lead Magnets**: Create ebooks, potentially using [[ai_agents_in_marketing | AI]] for content generation, and offer them as downloads at a low cost (e.g., 40 cents per download) to upsell into the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.

### 3. Ad Strategies
*   **Platforms**: Focus on Facebook Ads and [[tiktok_marketing_strategies_for_consumer_apps | TikTok ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   **Conversion Events**: Optimize for app installs and in-app actions like sign-ups or paid actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.
*   **UGC Creators**: Hire 5-10 UGC creators who can post daily videos and cross-post them across platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>. These creators serve as a test bed for viral content related to the product (hook, pain point, product as hero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>.
*   **[[tiktok_marketing_strategies_for_consumer_apps | TikTok Marketing]]**: Spin up 10 different TikTok accounts, remixing the best-performing UGC content with [[ai_agents_in_marketing | AI]] (ChatGPT for scripts, HeyGen for videos, Eleven Labs for audio, CapCut for editing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
*   **Website Pixelation and Remarketing**: Pixel website visitors (using Facebook, TikTok, Google pixels) to run indefinite remarketing ads to those who showed interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.
*   **Email Nurturing**: Capture emails on the website to create an email nurture sequence that up-sells the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.

### 4. Influencer Outreach
*   **Scale**: Identify and scrape emails of creators/channels in your category on platforms like YouTube (from their bios) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a> and Instagram (using tools like IGleads.io based on hashtags or keywords) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
*   **Cold Outreach**: Contact them to inquire about pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.
*   **Arbitrage**: Analyze average views vs. cost to find pricing discrepancies in the "imperfect market" of influencer rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.
*   **Deal Structure**: Typically, a three-video package (e.g., $1,500) combined with a 30% affiliate commission on recurring revenue creates stickiness and a "moat" against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. This allows for significantly lower CPMs (e.g., $5 CPM vs. $10 average TikTok CPM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.

### 5. Programmatic SEO
*   **Keyword Targeting**: For suitable categories, implement programmatic SEO by targeting thousands of longtail keywords (e.g., diet plans, nutrition plans for a calorie tracking app) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
*   **Domain Authority**: As the app gains domain authority (trust from backlinks), it can rank for lower keyword difficulty terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. Backlinks are links from other trusted websites to your site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>.
*   **Content Creation with [[ai_agents_in_marketing | AI]]**: Scrape top-ranking content for a target keyword, create an outline using [[ai_agents_in_marketing | AI]], and write blog posts section by section for quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.
    *   **Volume and Optimization**: Publish thousands of articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. Once a page gets traffic, a human SEO or content specialist refines it to balance what Google wants to rank and what humans find valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.
*   **Call to Actions (CTAs)**: Place CTAs to sign up for the app after the first paragraph, ensure one callout is visible in every scroll frame on mobile/desktop, and use a full-screen pop-up at 25-50% scroll rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>. This also helps pixel users for remarketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

Despite the obsession with short-form social media, significant opportunities remain in traditional ad channels for consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.

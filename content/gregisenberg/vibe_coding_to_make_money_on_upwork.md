This article explores an approachable method to generate income online through [[vibe_coding_tools_for_nondevelopers | vibe coding]] by [[selling_ai_services_on_upwork | selling AI services on Upwork]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Solo developers or small teams are reportedly making between $5,000 and $20,000 a month by finding prompting apps on Upwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This approach is not only for earning money but also for identifying business problems and potential SaaS opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Billy Howell, who has started and sold multiple Replit apps, shares his insights on this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## What is Vibe Coding?

[[vibe_coding_tools_for_nondevelopers | Vibe coding]] involves building apps with minimal friction, often leveraging AI-powered coding assistants and readily available tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. It's about getting from an idea to a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) quickly, often without deep technical coding expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a>. Billy, who is self-taught, emphasizes this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## The Upwork Ecosystem

Upwork serves as a platform to find potential buyers for applications before they are even built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Instead of building something and then seeking users, it's easier to find what someone wants to buy first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### Finding Opportunities on Upwork

To find jobs on Upwork, you can search for technologies that can be replaced or improved upon with a custom app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
Examples of searches include:
*   **Specific software:** Look for jobs related to existing software like AirTable, HubSpot, or Google Sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. The goal is to offer a better or cheaper custom solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **No-code/MVP development:** Jobs requesting "no code expert needed for MVP development" are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   **Automations:** Many automations can be converted into apps with a front end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **CRUD apps:** Simple "Create, Read, Update, Delete" (CRUD) apps, which involve putting data into a database, pulling it, and visualizing it, are ideal starting points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

### Pricing and Proposals

*   **Pricing:** Initial projects might be low-paying (e.g., $125) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>, but it's possible to submit proposals at a higher price and hope clients accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. A good starting point for a first app could be around $750 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.
*   **Recurring Revenue:** Consider opportunities for recurring revenue from clients needing future feature additions or hosting fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
*   **Upwork Connects:** Upwork requires "connects" (credits) to apply for jobs and to "boost" proposals to appear at the top of a client's inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   **Proposals:** For simpler apps, build a prototype first and send it as a Loom video demo within your proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. This approach proved successful for Billy's first project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

### Building the Prototype with AI

1.  **Define Requirements:** Take the job description and feed it into an AI like ChatGPT, asking it to format the requirements as a Product Requirements Document (PRD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. The PRD acts as a form for an engineer, outlining features and data types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.
2.  **Use an AI Coding Assistant:**
    *   **Replit:** Paste the PRD into Replit (V2 uses Claude 3.7) and instruct it to "build me this app" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. Replit scaffolds the entire app, building components and UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:20:00">[25:20:00]</a>. It's chosen for its low friction from idea to MVP, handling package management and deployment easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. Other comparable tools include Bolt and Lovable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.
    *   **UI Enhancement (VO):** For better UI, describe the desired page to VO (an AI design tool) to generate front-end code for a mockup. This is especially useful for wireframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. The code from VO can then be integrated into the Replit app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.
3.  **Approve Plan:** Replit's agent will present a plan, allowing you to select additional features like a PostgreSQL database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.
4.  **Iterate and Refine:** The AI provides a functional starting point, moving past initial "writer's block" in coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. While AI-generated apps can be solid for simple CRUD tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>, complex features like DocuSign, payment processors, or calendar integrations (due to date/time zone issues) can be trickier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>.
5.  **Troubleshooting:** For issues, Replit offers a "bounties" feature where you can pay developers (using "cycles") to troubleshoot problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>.

## Deployment and Ownership

*   **Deployment:** Apps can be deployed directly to a custom domain name within Replit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:04:00">[43:04:00]</a>, or the code can be pushed to GitHub and deployed elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:16:00">[43:16:00]</a>.
*   **IP Ownership:** For small projects, negotiating IP ownership isn't typically necessary. A standard boilerplate agreement is often sufficient unless you plan to use the IP in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:42:00">[42:42:00]</a>.

## Philosophy: Consulting vs. SaaS

Billy advocates for this consulting-based approach, even though it may seem like "small boy stuff" compared to building multi-million dollar SaaS businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17:00">[29:17:00]</a>.

### Advantages of Vibe Coding Consulting

*   **Derisking:** You can derisk the project by securing a price upfront from a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:57:00">[34:57:00]</a>.
*   **Learning:** Building many different apps exposes you to various libraries and APIs, fostering continuous learning and increasing "surface area of luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>.
*   **Direct Problem Solving:** It offers a direct approach to finding and resolving "burning hot problems" for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:00]</a>.
*   **B2B Focus:** Working with business owners can be more pleasant than dealing with a large B2C customer base, as there's a single source of truth for requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:05:00">[32:05:00]</a>.
*   **Scalability:** Once a solution is found for one client, it can be resold to others in the same industry with similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>.

### The "Difficulty Framework"

The effort required for different types of software creation can be categorized:
1.  **Easy Mode:** Getting paid for a service (like this consulting model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>.
2.  **Medium Mode:** Building a SaaS for B2B clients (e.g., 10 clients paying $1,000/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:00">[34:16:00]</a>.
3.  **Hard Mode:** Building a viral consumer social app (B2C), which often requires significant marketing investment and distribution expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:19:00">[34:19:00]</a>.

> "Building an audience is going to take time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:11:00">[30:11:00]</a>

This approach allows individuals to get "paid to learn" by constantly building and refining applications for real-world problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:06:00">[45:06:00]</a>.

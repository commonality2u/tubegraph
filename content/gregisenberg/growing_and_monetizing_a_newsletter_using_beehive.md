Starting an email-based business, particularly by building a newsletter, is a recommended path for individuals aiming to reach $10,000 to $20,000 per month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Platforms like Beehiiv simplify the process of growing from zero to 100,000 subscribers and achieving significant monthly monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Tyler Denk, co-founder of Beehiiv and formerly instrumental in Morning Brew's growth to 3.5 million subscribers, poured his knowledge into creating the Beehiiv platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

A newsletter with approximately 90,000 subscribers, like Tyler Denk's "Big Desk Energy" (which he dedicates about five hours a week to), can generate between $20,000 and $30,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Building the Newsletter Foundation

### Website and Signup Experience
Beehiiv offers a comprehensive website builder that allows users to create fully customizable websites for their newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This means a newsletter doesn't need to be sent via email and then manually copied to other platforms like WordPress for web hosting; when published, it exists simultaneously as an email and a web article, optimized for SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

Key features include:
*   **Customizable Pages** Users can create multiple pages, such as a subscribe page and an archive page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Email Capture Features** Pop-ups can be customized based on timing, specific pages, or even traffic sources (e.g., different pop-ups for Facebook vs. Twitter traffic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Integrated Data Tracking** Beehiiv tracks where subscribers and visitors originate from (e.g., X, LinkedIn) and their actions on the website and within emails, providing valuable audience data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Custom Signup Flows
A crucial aspect of user acquisition is the signup flow, which dictates what happens after someone enters their email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Interstitial Steps** This can include a recommendation model suggesting other newsletters or a survey to collect subscriber data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Final Destination Page** A thank-you page introduces the newsletter and its content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Tailored Flows** Different subscribe forms and pop-ups can lead to unique signup flows, allowing for acquisition strategies tailored to specific traffic sources, like Twitter or LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Welcome Series Automations
Automations are automated email journeys that begin when a new subscriber joins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Purpose** They can range from a simple welcome email to a multi-step journey with logic and parameter updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Building Trust and Engagement** A welcome email can introduce the newsletter, offer value (e.g., a relevant Spotify playlist), and humanize the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Call to Action** The welcome series is an ideal place to encourage action, such as referring others or making a purchase (e.g., one-on-one time, courses, SaaS products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   **Data Collection** A powerful feature is sending a follow-up email if a new subscriber skips the initial survey, incentivizing them to complete it for potential benefits like job opportunities, founder fundraise deal flow, or meetups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Tyler Denk achieved a 30% conversion rate on his follow-up survey email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
    *   Collecting data on demographics (age, gender, role, skill set) helps tailor content and makes it easier to sell advertisements to companies seeking specific audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
    *   Asking about a subscriber's 12-month goal and following up a year later can increase engagement and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

## Audience Growth Strategies

Growth is a compounding effect of multiple strategies, not a single "silver bullet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Boost Network (Paid and Organic Recommendations)
Beehiiv's Boost Network is a two-sided marketplace for [[referral_programs_for_newsletter_growth | newsletter growth]] and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.
*   **Organic Recommendations** Publishers can organically recommend other newsletters within the Beehiiv ecosystem in their subscribe flow, leading to passive subscriber growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Sponsored Recommendations** Newsletters can pay for recommendations. If a new subscriber opts in to a recommended newsletter, the referrer earns a set amount per lead (e.g., $2-4 per subscriber) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Campaign Management** Publishers can create offers specifying their target demographics and the per-subscriber payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. They can also apply to promote other newsletters.
*   **Quality Control** Beehiiv verifies subscribers, meaning publishers only pay for engaged leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.
*   **Auto-Pause Feature** This automation automatically cuts off underperforming acquisition channels based on set open rate thresholds (e.g., 30%), saving manual oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
*   **Auto-Accept Rules** Publishers can set filters (e.g., language, location, engagement, boost quality score) to automatically accept applications from other newsletters wanting to promote them, streamlining the acquisition process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

### Lead Magnets
A lead magnet is a digital or physical asset that people sign up for, related to the main offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.
*   **Implementation** Beehiiv's website builder allows creating custom pages for lead magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. A custom signup flow and automation can be set up to deliver the lead magnet (e.g., a PDF download) directly via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Content** Lead magnets should attract the desired audience. For example, a startup's seed deck targets founders and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.
*   **Monetization Opportunity** Once a lead magnet consistently drives sign-ups, it can be sponsored by relevant companies or VC firms, allowing the creator to use that revenue to acquire more subscribers for the lead magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

### [[referral_programs_for_newsletter_growth | Referral Programs]]
Built directly into Beehiiv, referral programs incentivize existing subscribers to share the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.
*   **Rewards** Rewards can be digital (e.g., a PDF, exclusive content) or physical (e.g., merchandise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. Digital rewards are preferred as they cost nothing and eliminate fulfillment issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
*   **Automation** Beehiiv automates reward fulfillment, sending emails with download links or promo codes once a referral milestone is hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
*   **Best Practice** Offering a valuable digital product for just one referral (e.g., Milk Road's crypto predictions PDF) teaches users how the program works and encourages participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.
*   **In-Newsletter Integration** A unique referral section can be added to every newsletter, allowing readers to track their referrals and access their unique referral link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Integration** Newsletters can partner with platforms like Beehiiv itself, offering their affiliate program as a referral reward. For instance, offering 50% off Beehiiv plans for referring three people to the newsletter; this simultaneously grows the newsletter, generates affiliate commission, and can be used to acquire more subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.

### Email Gating Content
This is a straightforward, highly effective strategy to capture emails from web visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.
*   **How it Works** Publishers can choose to "gate" their web content, meaning users cannot read the full article unless they subscribe to the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.
*   **Driving Traffic** Promoting gated articles on social media (X, LinkedIn, Instagram) drives interested traffic to the web version of the newsletter, where they are prompted to subscribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>.

## [[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | Monetization Strategies]]

Beehiiv offers multiple avenues for [[monetizing_newsletters | monetizing newsletters]]:

*   **Low Fees** Beehiiv charges a flat $10 transaction fee for direct bookings, unlike other platforms that take a percentage of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.
*   **Automation** The platform handles notifications, asset collection, invoicing, and reporting, streamlining the ad sales process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.

### Paid Subscriptions

*   **Flexible Pricing** Publishers can charge monthly, annually, or offer one-time payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>.
*   **No Revenue Cut** Beehiiv does not take a cut of subscription revenue; only standard Stripe processing fees apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:38">[01:04:38]</a>.

Many users generate six figures annually through paid subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>.

### Beehiiv Ad Network
This network connects publishers with premium advertisers like Netflix, Nike, Roku, and HubSpot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Automated Matching** Beehiiv provisions ads to publishers who are the best fit for the campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.
*   **Publisher Control** Publishers can choose the ad copy they prefer and the day it runs, then add it to their newsletter with one click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>.
*   **Performance-Based Payment** Publishers get paid per click, typically $3-4 per click, without direct interaction with the advertiser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>.

## Overall Philosophy and Benefits

Building a newsletter on Beehiiv is about creating a "vending machine" where an investment (e.g., $2.50 per subscriber) can yield a higher return (e.g., $4 from monetization), allowing for scalable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>.

### Purpose and Goals
The ultimate goal for a newsletter varies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.
*   **High-Growth Business** Many use Beehiiv's tools for rapid growth and significant monetization through ads and subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Community and Thought Leadership** Others, like Tyler Denk, use their newsletter as a platform for thought leadership, community building (e.g., hosting founder masterminds), and publicizing their journey, viewing monetization as a secondary benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">[01:09:42]</a>.
*   **Business Support** For agency owners or those with other ventures, a newsletter builds trust and positions them as a thought leader, benefiting their broader business portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>.

### Importance of Consistency
Consistency in publishing is paramount for building trust, engagement, and a strong brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>. Overcoming the fear of not always delivering "top-notch" content, like Seth Godin's daily blog, is key to continuous growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>. Writing weekly and sharing thoughts publicly has proven to be a high-leverage activity, opening doors for networking, investing, and personal inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.

Beehiiv aims to be a platform where users make more money through its features than they pay for the service, offering a strong return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>.

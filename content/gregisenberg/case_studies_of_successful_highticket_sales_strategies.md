From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

This article explores various strategies for selling high-ticket products and services, drawing insights from Jonathan Courtney's experience with AJ&Smart and other companies. The core principle revolves around dedicated sales funnels rather than traditional websites for driving conversions.

## Funnels vs. Websites: A Core Distinction

A fundamental concept in high-ticket sales is understanding the difference between a website and a sales funnel.
*   **Website** A website serves as a company's brochure or a digital storefront, allowing for browsing and general information gathering, similar to walking into a grocery store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:10">[03:32:10]</a>. It acts as a "shadow funnel" to prove a company's legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:10">[04:35:10]</a>. Websites typically have low conversion rates, often converting only 1-3% of visitors into customers or leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:06">[11:03:06]</a>. For high-ticket items, a website is primarily for validation after initial interest, not for driving sales directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:09">[06:39:09]</a>.
*   **Sales Funnel** A funnel is a step-by-step process designed to convert a stranger or non-customer into a paying customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:15">[03:13:15]</a>. Unlike websites, funnels are super-focused, telling a user to "do this then do this then do this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:11">[04:08:11]</a>. Funnels are explicitly designed for generating leads, call bookings, and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:24">[05:22:24]</a>. They are often completely separate from the main website, having different URLs and even differing in branding or design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Funnels can achieve significantly higher conversion rates, ranging from 10% to 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:15">[11:34:15]</a>.

| Location  | Main domain                           | Separate URLs, isolated               |

## Jonathan Courtney's $20 Million Funnel: A Case Study

Jonathan Courtney, the "Prince of Ireland" and "King of Berlin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>, developed a sales funnel that generated over $20 million in revenue for his company, AJ&Smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. AJ&Smart sells training to corporates (high-ticket) and individuals (up to $14,000 per participant), along with digital/hybrid coaching versions ranging from $5,000 upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:27">[08:39:27]</a>.

This specific funnel is a **Video Sales Letter (VSL) Funnel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:18">[17:13:18]</a>.

### Components of the VSL Funnel:

1.  **Traffic Generation**:
    *   **Paid Ads**: Primarily [[Strategies for creating effective sales funnels | Facebook (Meta) Ads]] and YouTube Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>. These ads target specific interests (e.g., people reading certain industry books) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Organic Content**: YouTube videos or blog posts serve as educational content that [[Building successful businesses through targeted media strategies | drives traffic]] to the funnel by including clear calls to action (CTAs) in comments or descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:16:00">[41:16:00]</a>. The content team's sole goal is to direct people to this one funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:43:00">[42:43:00]</a>.

2.  **Super-Focused Landing Page**:
    *   The ad or organic link leads to a landing page described as "full to the absolute brim with copy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>.
    *   Despite its "shitty" or "ugly" appearance, often lacking traditional branding elements like logos, this style works well and tends to perform better than aesthetically pleasing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:00">[30:38:00]</a>. The focus is on compelling copywriting and conversion optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.
    *   The page offers a **free training** (1-hour long video) which provides substantial value and gives a sense of what it's like to be trained by the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>. This long-form content helps qualify leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>.

3.  **Call to Action & Qualification**:
    *   During and after the free training video, a button appears, prompting viewers to **book a call** with the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>.
    *   **Friction Increasing Survey (Typeform)**: When lead flow is high, a survey is added before booking a call to pre-qualify prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:33:00">[34:33:00]</a>. This survey asks about work, goals, commitment, and investment capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:13:00">[35:13:00]</a>. If a prospect indicates they can invest less than a thousand euros, they are redirected to free resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Limited Call Booking Window**: Calls can only be booked three days in advance to ensure interested parties engage while their interest is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:47:00">[36:47:00]</a>.

4.  **Results**:
    *   This single "ugly" funnel, launched in 2020, has generated over $20 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>.
    *   It disproportionately generates leads for corporate training and agency projects, even though it wasn't explicitly designed for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>. For example, one lead from this funnel resulted in a $300,000 internal training session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01:00">[39:01:00]</a>.

## Other Effective Funnel Types

### Lead Generation Funnel (Lead Magnet Funnel)

This type of funnel focuses on collecting email addresses by offering valuable resources.
*   **Strategy**: Offer a template or resource (e.g., "how to prioritize ideas in meetings") from a YouTube video or blog post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:12:00">[45:12:00]</a>.
*   **Landing Page**: A very simple page, often lacking branding, where users provide their email for access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:33:00">[45:33:00]</a>.
*   **Follow-up**: Collected emails are put into a drip campaign that slowly introduces the company's offerings and warms them up to other funnels, like the VSL funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:50:00">[46:50:00]</a>. This allows for segmentation, directing high-ticket prospects to relevant programs and low-ticket prospects to campaigns like Black Friday sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:55:00">[47:55:00]</a>.

### Book Funnel

A highly effective funnel type that leverages the perceived value of a physical product.
*   **Strategy**: Offer a physical book, often for free or at less than cost price, primarily to capture email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:46:00">[50:46:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage**: Physical books generate significant organic marketing as people share photos of themselves with the book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:50:00">[51:50:00]</a>.
*   **The 2K Funnel Example**:
    1.  User buys the book (e.g., for €2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:33:00">[52:33:00]</a>.
    2.  Next page offers a "summary of the book now" via a video that also pitches deeper offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:57:00">[52:57:00]</a>.
    3.  This video leads to an offer for a higher-priced course (e.g., the Design Sprint Master Class for €2,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:19:00">[53:19:00]</a>. This allows for liquidation of ad costs with a small upsell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:40:00">[53:40:00]</a>.
    4.  A free training option is also offered for those who don't want to wait for the physical book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:00:00">[54:00:00]</a>.

## Universal Principles for High-Ticket Sales Funnels

### 1. Copywriting Over Design
*   Successful funnels prioritize compelling and informative copywriting over sleek visual design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:54:00">[30:54:00]</a>. "The like shittiest looking funnels we have tend to be the seven figure funnels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:00">[30:38:00]</a>.

### 2. Single-Minded Focus
*   Each funnel should have one clear goal, whether it's booking a call or making a direct sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. All content supporting the funnel should direct to this single goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:43:00">[42:43:00]</a>.

### 3. The "Most Incredible Free Gift Ever" (MIFY) Concept
*   MIFY involves stacking one-time free gifts onto a current offer to dramatically increase conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:43:00">[56:43:00]</a>.
*   This concept, often associated with QVC-style marketing, is widely used by popular brands like Eight Sleep, AG1, and Magic Mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:43:00">[55:43:00]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   AG1 offering welcome kits, travel pouches, D3, and Omega-3 as free gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:01:00">[57:01:00]</a>.
    *   Offering extra licenses for a team or printed workshop materials as free gifts for high-value corporate deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:43:00">[57:43:00]</a>.
*   This strategy relies on presenting these gifts as limited-time offers to create urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:17:00">[57:17:00]</a>.

### 4. [[Direct response marketing techniques | Direct Response Marketing]]
*   This style of marketing, often perceived as less prestigious, focuses on immediate action and measurable results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:34:00">[55:34:00]</a>. It's characterized by clear calls to action, urgency, and direct language. Many high-growth companies utilize it in their emails and sales processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:56:00">[55:56:00]</a>.

### 5. Retargeting with Pixels
*   While less powerful than before, Facebook (Meta) pixels allow companies to track visitors to funnel pages and retarget them with specific ads on social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:04:00">[46:04:00]</a>. This helps in showing relevant offers even if an email address isn't immediately captured.

## Applicability and Limitations

Sales funnels are highly effective for most verticals aiming to turn strangers into customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>.
*   **Suitable for**: Software companies (e.g., ClickFunnels itself uses funnels to sell software), agencies seeking high-ticket projects (website design, marketing services), and training/coaching businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:25:00">[25:25:00]</a>. It works particularly well for bootstrapped businesses due to the direct ROI from ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>.
*   **Less Suitable for**: Large corporations like OpenAI or Apple, where brand recognition and brute-force funding might negate the need for aggressive direct response tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>. Also, businesses where "extreme prestige" is paramount, such as a Michelin-star restaurant, might find funnels less applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:00">[26:20:00]</a>.

### Requirements for Success
*   **Running Ads**: It's very difficult to succeed with funnels without running paid advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:52:00">[28:52:00]</a>.
*   **Marketing Experience/Team**: Going from zero to 100 with funnels is challenging without an existing list or experience in marketing, copywriting, and landing page creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:00">[28:57:00]</a>.

## Learning and Implementation

*   **Study Competitors**: A highly recommended way to learn is by visiting the Facebook Ad Library, searching for competitors' ads, and clicking through to see what funnels they are running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.
*   **Recommended Reading**: Books like "Expert Secrets" and "DotCom Secrets" are valuable resources for understanding the concepts behind funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:17:00">[55:17:00]</a>.

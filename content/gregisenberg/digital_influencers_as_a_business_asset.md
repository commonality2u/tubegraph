The emergence of digital influencers presents a new business opportunity for brands to create and own marketing assets, bypassing many of the risks associated with human celebrity partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. This concept suggests a shift in [[influencer_marketing_strategies | influencer marketing strategies]] towards internally controlled digital entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

## Problems with Human Influencers
Traditional partnerships with celebrities and human influencers carry inherent risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. For example, when a celebrity like Zoë Grace Moretz, who was the face of Coach, faced public controversy, the brand, despite a multi-year deal, was left with a compromised representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. Such incidents can damage a brand's image and dilute the value of the partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

## Advantages of Digital Influencers
Digital influencers offer several compelling advantages:
*   **Cost-Effectiveness** They are significantly cheaper to utilize than human celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, offering a more effective reach for less investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   **Consistency and Reliability** Unlike human beings whose interests and personal lives can change, digital influencers remain perpetually on brand and consistently deliver promised work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
*   **Risk Mitigation** They eliminate the risk of scandal or negative press that a human celebrity might bring to a brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   **Owned Digital Asset** Digital influencers can become an owned media asset, similar to a YouTube channel or email list, appearing on a company's balance sheet as digital real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. This allows for long-term ownership and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
*   **Community and Lore Creation** Brands can create narratives, drama, and "lore" around these digital entities, fostering deeper audience buy-in and dialogue similar to fandoms for fictional characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
*   **Brand Personification** Assigning a digital face to a brand can make it more relatable and memorable for consumers, akin to the impact of iconic founders like Steve Jobs on Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

## Creation and Evolution of Digital Influencers
The initial concept of digital influencers like Lil Miquela paved the way for agencies to offer [[influencer_marketing_as_a_service | digital influencer creation as a service]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. The inevitable next step is for brands to develop internal teams dedicated to [[building_a_media_arm_to_traverse_brand_growth_and_influence | building a media arm to leverage brand growth and influence]] through these digital networks and communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

### How to Create a Digital Influencer
Creating a digital influencer involves using generative AI tools:
*   **Image Generation** Tools like Midjourney, D-ID, Stable Diffusion, and the newer Flux can generate a person's image or license someone's likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
*   **Training AI Models** A stable diffusion model can be trained on this chosen person's likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.
*   **Consistency** Features like "face lock" help maintain consistency across multiple generations of images and poses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. AI-powered editing tools (e.g., MockMoi.ai, Canva) and face-swapping technology can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>.
*   **Narrative Development** Once created, a narrative and lifestyle are crafted for the digital influencer to live out, similar to building lore around fantasy characters <a class="yt>timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. This can include creating YouTube channels for "hauls" or other content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

### Real-World Proof of Concept
The success of digital influencers like Aitana Lopez from Barcelona, an AI creation, highlights the potential. Her creators, an art collective, launched her, made her famous, and then sold her content on platforms like OnlyFans, generating significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. This demonstrates the level of engagement and monetization possible with digital avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The shift towards digital influencers is seen as an inevitability for direct-to-consumer (D2C) companies and eventually B2B sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. The cost-effectiveness and control offered by these assets make them highly appealing. For large corporations, the ability to have a consistent, scandal-free spokesperson for centuries, continually building an owned media asset, is a powerful incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. This approach is a key part of [[strategies_for_building_a_brand_using_digital_mass | building a brand using digital mass]] and [[media_and_content_strategies_for_business_growth | media and content strategies for business growth]] in the modern age.# Digital Influencers as a Business Asset

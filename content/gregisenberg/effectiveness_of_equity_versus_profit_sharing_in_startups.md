Founders often deeply misunderstand what it takes to scale a business beyond seven figures, particularly regarding employee incentives and compensation structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Historically, many startups, especially those that are venture-backed, have relied heavily on offering equity to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. However, this approach has often left employees with on-paper valuations that never materialize into actual wealth, leading to a growing preference for more tangible forms of compensation like profit sharing or bonus structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.

## Problems with Traditional Equity Compensation

A study by Harvard, alongside personal experience, suggests there's no significant increase in performance when employees are given equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. The core issue is that most employees, even sophisticated ones, struggle to understand or value equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. They may receive "phantom equity" in the form of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) that are simply filed away and not actively valued or tracked, leading to questions about lack of raises or actual financial benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. This means founders often give up significant ownership without receiving a tangible return in employee motivation or performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.

## Structuring Effective Incentives

The principle "show me the incentive, I'll show you the outcome" highlights the importance of aligning employee incentives with desired business results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

### The 50/50 Bonus Split

A common mistake in structuring bonuses is focusing solely on profit or solely on revenue, which can lead to unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>:
*   **Profit-focused bonuses**: Incentivize cost-cutting, potentially at the expense of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. For example, a COO might focus on reducing expenses like Upwork or Fiverr costs, or even firing team members, without considering overall growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue-focused bonuses**: Can lead to reckless spending on advertising or hiring excessive sales staff to drive top-line growth, resulting in lower overall profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

The ideal structure for executives, such as a COO, is a 50/50 split: 50% of the bonus tied to top-line revenue growth and 50% tied to bottom-line profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. This fosters "founder alignment" as the individual considers both growth and profitability simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. For example, they wouldn't mind a slight drop in profitability if it leads to a significant top-line increase, but they wouldn't sacrifice profitability for flat revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

### Employee Choice in Compensation

A more effective way to offer equity is to incorporate it into an employee's total compensation package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.
1.  **Define Total Compensation**: Start with the total desired compensation (e.g., $400,000 for a VP of Revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.
2.  **Set a Low Base Salary**: Keep the base salary as low as possible (e.g., $100,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.
3.  **Employee Decides Allocation**: Allow the employee to decide how the remaining amount (e.g., $300,000) is split between cash bonuses and equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.

This approach forces employees to actively consider the value of equity, making it feel like a real investment, similar to buying stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. If an employee chooses to invest $100,000 of their compensation into equity, they understand its value based on the company's 409a valuation and are genuinely "invested" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. This creates genuine "founder-employee alignment" because there's "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. It's more impactful for an employee to see $100,000 deposited into their bank account than to merely see 1,600 RSUs vested in a platform like Carta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.

## Importance for Scaling

Ignoring these fundamental aspects of compensation and incentive structures, particularly in the early phases of a startup, can be akin to "[[building_credibility_in_startups | building a skyscraper on a sandy foundation]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. Companies that scale to mid-seven figures without addressing these fundamentals often face significant churn and increased competition, leading to founder burnout or company collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. Prioritizing retention and proper incentive structures from the outset is crucial for sustainable growth and a successful exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.# Effectiveness of Equity vs. Profit Sharing in Startups

Zach Yagari, a 17-year-old entrepreneur, has built an [[successful_ai_applications_and_startups | AI startup]] called Cal AI that generates over $1 million per month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He shares insights and a detailed blueprint for building a new [[ai_startup_ideas_and_frameworks | AI startup idea]] similar to Cal AI, called "Dr. AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The "Dr. AI" Concept
Dr. AI is envisioned as an [[aipowered_mobile_apps_and_startups | AI-powered mobile app]] designed to provide quick, preliminary health diagnoses and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The idea stemmed from a friend's coincidental skin cancer discovery, highlighting the need for easier access to preliminary health checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The app aims to help users determine if a medical issue warrants an immediate doctor visit or if it can be monitored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Core Features
The app would include three main features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:
*   **Skin Scan**: Users can take a picture of a mark or rash on their skin to receive a diagnosis, indicating if it's harmful or benign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Symptoms Quiz**: A questionnaire where users input symptoms (e.g., cough, chills) to receive a few possible diagnoses with likelihood percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Chatbot**: A general medical chatbot for answering health-related questions. ChatGPT is noted for its diagnostic capabilities in medical problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

It's crucial for the app to include disclaimers, stating that diagnoses are not 100% accurate and should not replace professional medical advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### User Experience (UX) Design
Zach typically designs the UX himself, focusing on simplicity and digestibility, then hires designers to refine the visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Key UX principles for Dr. AI:
*   **Navigation Bar**: Basic "Home" and "Settings" options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Feature Buttons**: Three distinct buttons for "Scan Skin," "Symptoms Quiz," and "Chat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **History Log**: An "inscript feed" of past interactions, including previous chats, scans, and quiz results. This builds user investment and aids retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. It can also generate a digestible summary for doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Scanning Process**: Direct camera access for immediate scans, with an option to upload from the camera roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Instead of a dedicated "analyzing" screen, results load directly back onto the home screen to avoid making users wait on an empty interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Result Screen**: Displays the image, a "danger level" metric (e.g., 0-5 scale), and a diagnosis. Users can then ask follow-up questions in a chat about that specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Gamification**: Using numerical "danger levels" and multiple-choice quizzes makes the app more digestible and engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Inspiration**: Zach draws from [[successful_ai_applications_and_startups | AI apps]] like Cal AI and Riz GPT for "primitives" or building blocks, such as scanning screens and questionnaire pop-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### Prompting for AI Accuracy
To avoid generic disclaimers from the AI (like ChatGPT saying it's not a medical doctor), Zach suggests creative prompting techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>:
*   **Role Assignment**: Tell the AI to "take on the role of a doctor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.
*   **Contextual Framing**: Frame the interaction as a "movie script" where the AI acts as a doctor for a fictional scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.
*   **Function Calls**: When using the API directly, assign the AI's response to a specific variable (e.g., "explanation") to control the output and prevent unwanted disclaimers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.
*   **Accuracy**: Crucially, ensure the [[utilizing_ai_in_startup_growth | AI's responses are accurate]] by breaking down complex prompts into a "big pipeline" of smaller prompts, as done with Cal AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.

## Go-to-Market Strategy
Zach emphasizes designing the product with the marketing strategy, particularly influencer marketing, in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

### Influencer Marketing
*   **Simplicity for Marketing**: The app needs to be simple and clear enough for a viewer to understand its value within a 2-second glimpse on an influencer video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.
*   **Branding**: Display the app's name prominently on key screens, especially the "wow factor" screens (like the scan result) that influencers are most likely to show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.
*   **Wow Factor**: For Dr. AI, the "scan skin" feature with its "danger level" diagnosis is the primary wow factor to highlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.
*   **Shareability**: While utility apps like Dr. AI might have low direct shareability (e.g., users sharing their personal diagnosis), word-of-mouth among target audiences (like parents) can drive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
*   **Target Audience & Influencer Selection**:
    *   Identify the core user base (e.g., concerned moms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.
    *   Research influencers whose audience aligns with this target, rather than just the influencer's niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. Reading comments on influencer posts helps determine their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
    *   Focus on "Mom" influencers or those who create "Mom hack" content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.
*   **Influencer Pitch Angle**: Create a realistic scenario that plays on emotions, perhaps "fearmongering" slightly to highlight the problem the app solves (e.g., a mom worried about a bump on her child's arm, then relieved by Dr. AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
*   **Influencer Pricing**:
    *   Aim for RPM (revenue per thousand views) to be greater than CPM (cost per thousand views) to ensure profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.
    *   Pay influencers upfront based on predicted views, assuming an initial RPM (e.g., $5 for [[ai_app_startups_and_ideas | AI apps]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.

## Pricing Strategy for the App
For Dr. AI, Zach recommends a weekly pricing model due to its "need-based" utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
*   **Weekly Subscription**: Users might subscribe when needed, then unsubscribe, only to resubscribe when another issue arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **No Free Trial**: To maximize revenue from these intermittent users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.
*   **Pricing Sweet Spot**: Typically, $4 to $7 a week for similar [[ai_app_startups_and_ideas | AI apps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.
*   **AB Testing**: Experiment with various weekly, monthly, and yearly price points, with and without free trials, to find the highest "proceeds per download" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations
Zach stresses the importance of accuracy and disclaimers for a medical app, ensuring it doesn't provide misleading information that could harm users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. This is critical for preventing negative consequences, especially compared to less sensitive apps like calorie trackers where inaccuracy might lead to weight gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>.

Zach has generously provided this [[ai_tools_for_startup_creation | AI startup idea]] and blueprint, encouraging others to build it and create a success story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>.

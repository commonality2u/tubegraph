## Growing Blue-Collar Startups

While many discuss the ease of starting blue-collar businesses like window cleaning, power washing, and lawn mowing, few detail how to grow them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These businesses are approachable and can be started with an initial investment of around $150 for equipment from stores like Lowe's or Home Depot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The key is to choose services where visible improvements can be made, allowing neighbors to see the difference and serve as a selling point for the whole neighborhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

The strategic path involves starting a service business, mastering its marketing, transforming that knowledge into an agency, and then using the generated cash flow to acquire stakes in similar companies across various geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This long-term vision can evolve into a significant portfolio company over a 7-10 year period, moving from "baby entrepreneur" to "pro level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Optimizing Your Google My Business Profile

To acquire customers for local service businesses, optimizing a Google My Business (GMB) profile listing is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This optimization helps businesses rank in the "snack pack"â€”the top three Google Maps listings that appear on page one for local service searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Key Optimization Steps

1.  **Address Setup**
    *   A physical address is preferred over a PO Box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   You can sometimes use a family member's business address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

2.  **Building Business Citations**
    *   Citations are listings of your business information on online directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   Consistency is vital: ensure your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) are *exactly* the same across all citations as they are on your GMB profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Google views matching information as a trust signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
    *   You can find freelancers on platforms like Fiverr to create 300 citations for around $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

3.  **Keyword Optimization**
    *   **Description:** Include desired keyword phrases (e.g., "Window Cleaning Denver," "Window Cleaning [Service Area]") in your GMB description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. [[AI and SEO integration for business growth | AI]] tools like ChatGPT or Claude can write natural-sounding descriptions that incorporate these keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Keyword stuffing has even been shown to work in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   **Services Section:** List the same keywords in the "services you offer" section of your GMB profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   **Listing Title:** While a "gray area," including your highest target keyword in the listing title (e.g., "Denver Window Cleaning Company") can boost rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This is similar to strategies used by businesses that name themselves "Taco Near Me" to capture "near me" searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

4.  **Images and Reviews**
    *   Images are a highly important component for GMB ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
    *   Contrary to popular belief, reviews are less critical than keyword optimization and business information matching, especially in smaller geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. What matters most is being an exact match for a person's search and having supporting business information across the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

5.  **Phone Numbers**
    *   Real phone numbers (e.g., cell phones or VoIP) are more effective than Google Business phone numbers for GMB optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Advanced Optimization Techniques

For highly competitive markets, additional steps can be taken:

1.  **Indexing Citations:**
    *   Citation websites are massive, so Google may not fully crawl them. An indexing bot can "drip traffic" to these specific citation URLs, signaling Google to crawl and index them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
    *   A Telegram bot called Speedy Indexer is recommended for this purpose, costing only a few cents per listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This entire GMB optimization process can be done for under $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

2.  **Embedding Google Maps Listing (Private Blog Networks - PBNs):**
    *   Google prioritizes embedded content, viewing it as a signal of a real and valuable resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
    *   The Google Maps listing can be embedded on a Private Blog Network (PBN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. PBNs consist of thousands of interconnected blogs owned by a single entity, which used to be for direct ranking but are now used for "tier two" or "tier three" links to help content get seen and indexed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
    *   Services like "Kevin PBNs" (found on Black Hat World forum) can publish articles with embedded GMB listings for around 50 cents per article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## Results and Scaling

These GMB optimization techniques can yield rapid results, with some businesses moving into the Google snack pack within a week and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This speed is much faster than traditional SEO, which can take at least three months to achieve front-page rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

Once you have mastered these skills and demonstrated success with your own service business, you can leverage this expertise:

1.  **Create an Agency:** Offer digital marketing services (specifically GMB optimization) to other local businesses, setting flat fees or performance-based models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
2.  **Direct Mail & Flyers:** Supplement digital efforts with traditional marketing. Use services like Lob.com to send direct mail flyers to addresses in affluent zip codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, or even simply distribute flyers door-to-door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
3.  **Acquire Equity:** Use the cash flow from your agency and initial service business to buy portions of other local service companies. You can offer to handle their marketing in exchange for equity, potentially via seller financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
4.  **[[Utilizing YouTube for lead generation in service businesses | YouTube for Lead Generation]]:** Film satisfying aspects of your service work (e.g., power washing, lawn mowing transformations) and upload them to YouTube. This can generate ad revenue and inbound leads by targeting local audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

This [[building_and_monetizing_lead_generation | lead generation]] and scaling model can be a 3-5 year sprint, transforming an entrepreneur's journey from beginner to a "pro level" player in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. The personal brand story, similar to Alex Hormozi's approach with Gym Launch, where you show how you grew your own business, is highly effective for gaining trust and attracting clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

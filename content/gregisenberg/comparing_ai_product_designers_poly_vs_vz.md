From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

This article explores a live comparison of two AI product designers, [[review_of_ai_product_designer_poly_backed_by_y_combinator | Poly]] and [[overview_of_vercel_and_vz | VZ]], to determine their effectiveness in generating production-ready designs and front-end code from English prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The objective was to see if these [[the_potential_for_ai_in_generating_production_ready_designs | AI product designers]] live up to their claims and can be integrated into everyday workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Initial Impressions and Setup

### Poly
[[review_of_ai_product_designer_poly_backed_by_y_combinator | Poly]], a Y Combinator-backed startup, is marketed as an AI product designer that creates "beautiful designs" and "production ready code" from simple English descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The user tried [[review_of_ai_product_designer_poly_backed_by_y_combinator | Poly]] live for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

Key features observed:
*   An interface similar to ChatGPT, allowing users to write what they want to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   Microphone input for voice commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   Option to upload an image to create an interface similar to the one provided, allowing for wireframe uploads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This feature was previously used with [[overview_of_vercel_and_vz | VZ]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   Light and dark mode options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   Customization options for font, radius, and colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   A credit system for generations: 50 credits per page, 25 credits per component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### VZ
[[overview_of_vercel_and_vz | VZ]] is described as a well-known product in the AI designer space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The user has experience using [[overview_of_vercel_and_vz | VZ]] for similar tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## The Startup Idea Test Case
To test the AI designers, a multi-million dollar startup idea was used: an algorithm that simulates how thousands of users react to a tweet, predicting virality before posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The idea was adapted for YouTube, predicting engagement (comments, likes, subscribers) based on title and thumbnail changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This concept aims to go deeper than existing YouTube A/B testing features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

The prompt given to both tools, along with a screenshot of the original tweet idea, was to "create a SAS that does this" with a "glassy minimalist and with colorful calls to action" design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Performance and Output

### Poly's First Attempt
[[review_of_ai_product_designer_poly_backed_by_y_combinator | Poly]] took a few minutes to generate the design, showing no progress bar during the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The generated product was named "To Predict" and featured AI-powered analytics to optimize YouTube content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

However, the output was a landing page, not the actual product interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Clicking on "analytics" or "get started" buttons resulted in a black screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The design did not feel "glassy" as requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This highlighted a need for more specific design terminology in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

### Poly's Second Attempt (with specific design term)
The user then explicitly requested "glass morphism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, and provided feedback that the initial product images were irrelevant, resembling website analytics dashboards rather than YouTube-specific tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

The second generation by [[review_of_ai_product_designer_poly_backed_by_y_combinator | Poly]] was more successful, building out an actual product interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. While not fully "glassy," it started to look "pretty good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a> and incorporated elements like "AI suggestions" and "performance comparison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. A notable positive was the hover-over functionality on charts, allowing users to see specific data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. Poly also generates the underlying code, which is helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

### VZ's Performance
When given the same prompt and image, [[overview_of_vercel_and_vz | VZ]] displayed its reasoning process, explaining how it would create the SAS application and its design choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This transparent communication was a significant advantage over [[review_of_ai_product_designer_poly_backed_by_y_combinator | Poly]]'s "black box" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

[[overview_of_vercel_and_vz | VZ]]'s generation time felt faster due to the ongoing feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. The output was "very similar" to the provided image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a> and included interactive elements such as "version A original content" and "predict performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

When prompted about the "glass-morphic" design, [[overview_of_vercel_and_vz | VZ]] acknowledged that its current design didn't fully embrace it and offered to enhance it with specific details like "frosted glass aesthetic with more pronounced blur Effects light borders and depth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This interactive feedback loop was highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. The refined VZ design became "a little more glossy" and "beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

Ultimately, [[overview_of_vercel_and_vz | VZ]] was perceived as "a little bit better" in its current state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>, offering a nicer visual design and valuable feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. However, the speaker emphasizes that [[review_of_ai_product_designer_poly_backed_by_y_combinator | Poly]] could improve quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

### The Role of AI in Product Design
The comparison highlights that even advanced AI product designers like [[review_of_ai_product_designer_poly_backed_by_y_combinator | Poly]] and [[overview_of_vercel_and_vz | VZ]] require the user to understand design terms and provide specific prompts to achieve desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. An ideal AI product designer would proactively ask questions to understand user "taste and vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Strategy for Using AI Design Tools
The speaker recommends using multiple tools, similar to how users might combine ChatGPT and Claude for writing and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. By combining tools like [[overview_of_vercel_and_vz | VZ]] and [[review_of_ai_product_designer_poly_backed_by_y_combinator | Poly]], users can leverage their individual strengths, for example, by taking a [[overview_of_vercel_and_vz | VZ]] design and asking [[review_of_ai_product_designer_poly_backed_by_y_combinator | Poly]] to enhance it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. This approach can lead to getting the most out of [[the_role_of_product_design_in_ai_startups | AI product design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. This approach of using a combination of tools falls under [[techniques_to_enhance_ai_interface_design | techniques to enhance AI interface design]].

> [!NOTE] Startup Idea Given Away
> The idea for a YouTube analytics and prediction SaaS product remains a valuable concept for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. This serves as an example of [[using_ai_for_rapid_mvp_development | using AI for rapid MVP development]].

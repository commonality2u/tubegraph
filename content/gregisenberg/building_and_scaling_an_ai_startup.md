David Park, co-founder of Jenny AI, successfully scaled his [[impact_of_ai_on_startups_and_entrepreneurship | AI startup]] from zero to $10 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in just a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His approach to growth marketing, particularly for an [[impact_of_ai_on_startups_and_entrepreneurship | AI startup]], is considered comprehensive and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This playbook covers strategies including paid ads, SEO, and influencer marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Organic Short-Form Content & Influencer Marketing

David Park emphasizes the power of organic short-form content and influencer marketing as key growth tactics for [[impact_of_ai_on_startups_and_entrepreneurship | AI startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### The "Fresh Account" Advantage
Unlike traditional social media where follower count and channel history were paramount, new accounts with few followers can quickly go viral today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Experiments at Jenny AI showed that content posted on an account with 50 followers sometimes outperformed the same content on an account with 70,000 followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This phenomenon is particularly relevant for [[impact_of_ai_on_startups_and_entrepreneurship | AI startups]] because the product itself can be a "spectacle" or "magic" that's pleasant to watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

> "You can literally just make a straightup ad about your product, if the hook is good and the content is you know high quality you have a good shot of getting you know 10 100 thousand a million views and that's obviously you know cost you very little or nothing to do." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>

Park suggests that sponsoring a fresh account, even one created recently, can be more beneficial than working with a YouTuber with millions of subscribers if both have similar view counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Fresh accounts are often "juiced by the algorithm" and can be sponsored at a fraction of the cost compared to established YouTubers who expect large sums for endorsements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Creating Your Own Accounts
Instead of only sponsoring new accounts, businesses can create these accounts themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. The strategy involves having a creator be the "face" of the product on a new account, educating viewers about pain points and helpful advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This allows creators to avoid "polluting" their main account with ads while providing the business with fresh, high-quality content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### Case Study: Ming Duck & Jenny AI
Jenny AI partnered with a creator named Ming Duck, paying him $4,000 per month for 20 videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. His new account, starting from zero followers, grew to 70,000 followers and generated half a billion views across platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. In the first month alone, they garnered 7 million impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This collaboration provided a significant return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

For creators, consistent monthly revenue for a few months can be more appealing than a one-off brand deal, especially if it involves creating content they already enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Businesses can make content creation easier by supplying screen grabs and product videos, requiring the creator only to brainstorm hooks and record themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### The Order of Virality
The process for achieving viral growth involves:
1.  **Farming multiple accounts:** Instead of one account per platform, create many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
2.  **Experimentation:** Test tons of hooks and video ideas with different creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
3.  **Competitive analysis:** Snoop on competitors and other industries to see what's trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
4.  **Finding a viral video:** Through experimentation, a video will eventually go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
5.  **Turning it into a series:** Transform the viral video into a repeatable series by tweaking it slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
6.  **Multi-account posting:** Post the series on multiple accounts; Jenny AI had 24 accounts posting daily at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
7.  **Language translation:** Translate and create the same video with creators in different languages (e.g., Chinese, Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
8.  **Sponsor other pages:** Pay meme pages or other large accounts to repost your viral content for a second life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
9.  **Paid ads:** Use mega-viral content for paid advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
10. **Adaptation:** Eventually, copycats will emerge, and the series will get played out, requiring a return to step one to find new hooks and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

> "The entire goal when working with your creator is to find a viral series because a video that goes viral once will go viral again." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>

This strategy relies on the human tendency to watch similar content repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. An example is the "spaghetti and pole" video series, where the same concept was repeated with different materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. Jenny AI's "POV: you have a paper or an essay due" series generated over 300 million views and hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

### Product-Format Fit
It's crucial that the viral content aligns with your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Going viral for the sake of it is "empty calories" if it doesn't lead to conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. A video with 50,000 views that converts well is more valuable than one with 20 million views that has a negligible effect on conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

### Reaching Out to Influencers
Finding influencers requires understanding your users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. Ask users who they follow, particularly those who influence them in areas related to your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. Look at who those influencers follow and use suggested similar accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.

A "hack" for finding influencers is to create a new social media account, manually follow a list of relevant influencers, and watch their videos all the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. The algorithm will then suggest other relevant influencers, potentially revealing highly effective creators with low follower counts and great content whom you can sponsor at a low cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>.

When reaching out:
*   **Use all avenues:** Direct messages, emails, LinkedIn, and even obscure blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.
*   **Be detailed and tailored, but concise:** Show you're a genuine fan of their content and why their audience would love your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.
*   **Indicate it's a paid promotion:** Clearly state that it's a paid opportunity to get serious consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **Expect low response rates initially:** Develop thick skin; most won't respond, especially early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. As your product gains recognition, it becomes easier to secure partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.

### Negotiating with Influencers
Align incentives by not paying all the money upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. Split payments so a percentage is tied to conversions (e.g., via personal coupon codes) or views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. Be straightforward about budgets, desired countries, and expected ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

Start negotiations by asking for the "most expensive price point" (e.g., full usage rights, all platforms, dedicated video), then negotiate down by removing elements you don't need until you reach a fair price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. Then, propose a bulk deal for multiple videos at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. Avoid pricing based solely on follower count, as it's often misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

### Posting Content
The content must fit the influencer's cultivated audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. If you lack experience, trust the influencer to create content similar to their usual posts, but dictate where and how your product is featured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. Ideally, integrate your product into the influencer's existing popular series (e.g., "Top 10 AI tools") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>.

To scale [[strategies_for_marketing_startups_using_AI | influencer marketing]], you eventually need to trust influencers with a clear blueprint and set expectations for views/engagement, allowing them to "cook" without constant micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. This "set and forget" approach is crucial for efficiency, as seen by Jenny AI running a program spending tens to hundreds of thousands per month with only two people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>.

Don't be afraid of videos looking like a "straightup ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. While they might get fewer views, overtly solving a pain point leads to better conversion rates from those who genuinely need your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

### General Tips for Influencer Marketing
*   **Balance creativity and science:** While content creation is an art, managing campaigns requires analytical and organizational skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. Track data to identify winning and losing influencers and refine your approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>.
*   **Build relationships:** Develop genuine human connections with creators to break through the noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.
*   **Leverage common ground:** Find shared interests or experiences with influencers to increase your chances of a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

SEO is a long-term strategy that provides "delayed gratification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. It's generally not recommended for early-stage startups because other channels like influencer marketing can yield much faster traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>. Jenny AI found success with SEO after acquiring an entire SEO agency, turning them into an in-house team dedicated solely to Jenny AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

### SEO Strategies
*   **Target featured snippets:** Focus on optimizing content to capture Google's featured snippets, which can allow you to leapfrog competitors in search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.
*   **Leverage brand name searches:** Users often watch short-form content and then search for the product name on Google rather than clicking through external links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. Strong influencer marketing naturally increases brand name searches, passively boosting your SEO legitimacy with Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.
*   **Focus on high-intent keywords:** Prioritize keywords that indicate buying intent rather than generic or "free" searches, which often don't convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.
*   **Develop mini-tools and localized content:** Create free mini-tools and landing pages in different languages to attract traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.

SEO should be implemented once a startup has a steady income stream and some level of Product-Market Fit (PMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.

## Paid Advertising

Paid ads are also seen as less ideal for early-stage entrepreneurs due to slower iteration cycles compared to organic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. Many startups get stuck in a "paid ads trap," remaining unprofitable with low Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) to Lifetime Value (LTV) ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>.

### Paid Ad Strategies
*   **Reuse organic content:** High-performing organic content from influencer marketing can be repurposed for paid ads, as it's already proven to resonate with audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>.
*   **Leverage social media data for targeting:** Data from social media partnerships (e.g., which countries convert best, LTV by country, ideal user types) can inform and improve paid ad targeting from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.
*   **Wait for PMF:** Early-stage startups often lack the budget to spend enough on platforms like Meta to gather sufficient data for effective purchase-based targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>. Jenny AI only started investing in paid ads after achieving some PMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.
*   **Aim for a high LTV/CAC ratio and short payback period:** Jenny AI aims for a 3:1 LTV/CAC ratio and makes back its money within the first two months of acquiring a user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. This allows for quick reinvestment into top-performing acquisition channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.

Paid ads are considered the "most boring growth channel," so it's advised to explore other channels first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>.

## Scaling from $5M to $10M ARR

The core strategies outlined for initial growth remained relevant for scaling from $5M to $10M ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. However, scaling requires more focus on:
*   **Hiring and team building:** Developing better hiring practices and building out teams to manage increased operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:39">[01:02:39]</a>.
*   **Affiliate marketing:** A significant portion of Jenny AI's revenue comes from affiliate marketers who champion the product and earn a cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   **Acquisitions:** Jenny AI acquired other [[building_ai_startups_frameworks_and_ideas | startups]] to hedge bets and expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. They were able to double the revenue of one acquired startup in five months without significant marketing budget by applying learnings from Jenny AI's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Back to basics: Retention and Conversion:** As the scale increases, improving retention and conversion rates becomes even more critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>. Jenny AI focused on this, reducing its churn from 20% to 9.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. High churn is a common challenge for Business-to-Consumer (B2C) [[using_ai_to_build_saas_startups | AI SaaS]] tools, often seeing 30-50% monthly churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>. Reducing churn significantly makes growth much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>.

Ultimately, reaching $10M ARR involved refining existing strategies, improving internal processes like hiring and team management, focusing on core metrics like retention, and exploring new growth avenues like acquisitions and affiliate programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

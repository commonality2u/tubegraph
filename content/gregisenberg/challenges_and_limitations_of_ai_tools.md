While AI tools like Manis AI offer significant opportunities for [[impact_of_ai_and_new_tools_on_product_development | product development]] and [[building_a_business_with_ai_tools | business building]], they also come with a distinct set of [[benefits_and_challenges_of_using_ai_in_app_creation | challenges and limitations]]. Users should be aware of these aspects to manage expectations and ensure secure, effective usage.

## Current State and Performance Issues

Manis AI, despite its capabilities, is still in its beta stage and not perfect, often encountering errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

Key performance limitations include:
*   **Stuck Processes** Manis can get stuck on various tasks, such as CAPTCHAs during browsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. It may also encounter "critical issues" requiring a computer reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>, though it often remembers where it left off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
*   **Error Handling** While Manis AI aims to handle errors on its own and reflect on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>, these errors can interrupt tasks, such as failing to zip files after code creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.
*   **Frequent Errors** As more users gain access to the system, there has been a noticeable increase in frequent errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

## Technical and Contextual Limitations

AI tools, including Manis, face specific technical hurdles:
*   **Context Window Limitations** Manis AI's performance can decline with "extremely long context" and complex tasks that require processing a lot of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. This is identified as a major issue that needs addressing before wider release, as it often necessitates starting a new session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>.
*   **Deployment Challenges** While Manis can generate code, deploying applications is "not as straightforward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>. The tool sometimes encounters issues with the deployment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a> and may suggest running the application locally instead of deploying it to a public network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. This indicates that the comprehensive packaging of services, including deployment, is still an unsolved challenge for Manis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>.
*   **Aesthetic Refinement** For tasks like game creation, initial outputs might be basic, requiring users to provide specific instructions for aesthetics or adding more objects to the scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>.

## Access and Scalability

*   **Limited Access** Manis AI is currently invitation-only with limited invitation codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>. This limits widespread access for potential users.
*   **Daily Usage Limits** There is a maximum daily usage limit, typically around 10 requests or sessions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>. While a workaround exists by using a different session after hitting the limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>, this still highlights a scalability challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>.

## [[security_and_privacy_concerns_with_ai_applications | Security and Privacy Concerns]]

As Manis is a Chinese company, there are valid concerns about data security and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. Chinese companies may be obligated to provide government access to user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. Therefore, users are advised to:
*   Be cautious about sharing personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
*   Only provide broad, simple requests when first trying the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   Scan through any generated code before downloading or running it locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>.
*   Consider running downloaded code in a virtual sandbox in the cloud rather than directly on a local computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>.

Despite these limitations, understanding a competitor's approach is crucial for a [[competitive_approach_to_ai_usage | competitive approach to AI usage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. The existence of tools like Manis AI can inspire US companies to build similar or improved alternatives, fostering innovation and providing more options, including open-source projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

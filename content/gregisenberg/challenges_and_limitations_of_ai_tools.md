While AI tools like Manis AI offer significant promise for automating tasks and building businesses, the transcript highlights several [[challenges_and_expectations_with_ai_design_tools | challenges and limitations]] that users may encounter.

## Technical Hurdles
Manis AI, being in beta, is not perfect and can experience errors [00:30:19]. Users reported experiencing issues like:
*   **Getting Stuck**: The AI can get "stuck" on tasks, such as navigating web pages or processing certain requests. An example given was Manis getting stuck on CAPTCHAs, requiring human intervention [00:07:56]. During the demonstration, it got stuck while trying to collect [[deep_research_techniques_using_ai_tools | Greg Eisenberg's startup ideas]] [00:24:47], leading to a "critical issue" and requiring a computer reset [00:30:00].
*   **Context Limitations**: Manis AI's performance can decline with "extremely long context" [00:44:21]. This is noted as a significant issue that the Manis AI team needs to address before a full launch, as power users tend to push the system to its limits [00:45:00]. This limitation prevented the AI from completing the full research task for startup ideas [00:56:11].
*   **Inconsistent Deployment**: While AI tools are progressing in [[integrating_ai_tools_in_product_development | product development]], deployment remains a challenge. The DocuSign clone, for instance, encountered an issue during the public deployment process [00:35:02], prompting Manis to suggest running it locally instead [00:35:14]. This suggests that "deployment is not an easy easy one that they have solved yet" [00:48:01].
*   **Lack of Full Autonomy**: Although advanced, agentic AI like Manis isn't fully autonomous. It may require human intervention or confirmation for certain actions [00:13:10], and doesn't always "produce everything like in one go" [00:58:33].

## Usability and Control
*   **Abstracted Processes**: Manis AI operates as a "black box" [00:36:59], where much of the underlying process is hidden from the user. While some users might prefer this simplicity, others may desire more transparency.
*   **Aesthetics and Refinement**: While AI can generate initial outputs, aesthetic refinement often requires further, specific instructions. For example, a generated airplane game might need more visual detail like "add a building add a tree right at lakes or something" to make it "more interesting" [00:58:43].

## Security and Privacy Concerns
*   **Data Security**: As a Chinese company, Manis AI raises concerns about data privacy and access by the Chinese government [00:27:10]. Users are advised to be "very careful and mindful of what type of data that you give to and and give access to" [00:29:21]. It is recommended to avoid providing personal information or setting up sensitive accounts like Stripe [00:33:16] and to review generated code for local deployment [00:55:18]. Using a virtual sandbox for testing is also suggested [00:55:41].

## Scalability and Performance
*   **User Load Issues**: The platform experienced performance degradation as more users gained access. Initially, errors were less frequent, but "now that more access has been given out and more people are on the system, I start to notice a lot more frequent errors" [00:50:57]. This highlights a [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_business_development | scaling challenge]] that needs to be addressed before wider release.
*   **Daily Usage Limits**: During its beta phase, Manis AI implemented a "maximum daily usage limit" [00:48:44], typically around 10 requests or sessions [00:57:17], which can restrict prolonged use for complex tasks.

## Overall Assessment
Despite these [[challenges_and_potentials_of_ai_operator_services | challenges]], Manis AI is seen as "the closest thing I've seen to AGI yet" [01:01:32], providing a "super super super helpful" [01:01:54] tool for automating and building businesses due to its integrated capabilities that combine research, design, and execution. However, it still needs further development to achieve seamless, fully autonomous operation and overcome its current limitations.

From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Chris Baroke has developed a significant portfolio of native [[building_ios_apps_with_ai | iOS]] mobile [[ai_app_development_strategies | apps]] by leveraging [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] tools like [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_vzer_for_app_and_content_development | Cursor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. He shares his precise techniques, including using [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] agents, OpenRouter, and [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | ChatGPT]] for image generation, to create polished, native mobile applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Developer Profile & Philosophy

Initially, Chris's portfolio of clean and interesting mobile [[ai_app_development_strategies | apps]] led many to believe a large company was behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, Chris is a "regular guy" who uses [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] to build these [[ai_app_development_strategies | apps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. He has developed four robust productivity [[ai_app_development_strategies | apps]], including "Ellie," a daily planning app with thousands of monthly active users and around 2,000 paid users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. His ability to build such complex applications as a solo developer is attributed to [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] supercharging his workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Chris aims to provide an "advanced [[advanced_workflow_techniques_for_mobile_app_development | Cursor]] workflow" for native [[building_ios_apps_with_ai | iOS]] development, which is not commonly seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. He hopes to demystify [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] usage for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Core Tools and Technologies

Chris primarily uses [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_vzer_for_app_and_content_development | Cursor]] for coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. He has tried many [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] coding tools over two years, including GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | Claude Code]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. For native [[building_ios_apps_with_ai | iOS]] development, [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_vzer_for_app_and_content_development | Cursor]] is his preferred tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

For asset generation, he uses [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | ChatGPT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. His primary LLM model is [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | Claude]] 3.7, which he finds superior for native [[building_ios_apps_with_ai | iOS]] development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Development Workflow and Techniques

Chris outlines his [[advanced_workflow_techniques_for_mobile_app_development | advanced workflow techniques for mobile app development]]:

### [[using_xcode_and_swift_for_ios_development | iOS Development]] with [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_vzer_for_app_and_content_development | Cursor]] and [[using_xcode_and_swift_for_ios_development | Xcode]]

His process involves opening the [[using_xcode_and_swift_for_ios_development | Xcode]] project file directly in [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_vzer_for_app_and_content_development | Cursor]] for edits, using [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_vzer_for_app_and_content_development | Cursor]]'s chat feature for file modifications, and then switching back to [[using_xcode_and_swift_for_ios_development | Xcode]] to build the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This method is significantly faster than his previous approach of manually pasting code into [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | Claude]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

*   **Manual [[using_xcode_and_swift_for_ios_development | Xcode]] Project Setup**: It's crucial not to use [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_vzer_for_app_and_content_development | Cursor]] to set up the [[using_xcode_and_swift_for_ios_development | Xcode]] project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Many manual settings, such as embedding frameworks or enabling network requests, must be done directly in [[using_xcode_and_swift_for_ios_development | Xcode]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_vzer_for_app_and_content_development | Cursor]] is less capable in this area compared to, for example, [[building_ai_apps_with_cursor_firebase_and_vercel | React Native]] development where it can handle terminal commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Targeting UI First**: Chris focuses on building the user interface (UI) with dummy data first before connecting to the backend or live data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This approach makes it easier for the [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] to follow instructions by concentrating on one task at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   **Contextual UI Generation**: When prompting for UI elements, Chris specifies to follow the existing UI style of the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This prevents the [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] from generating disparate components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **Using Screenshots for UI Feedback**: He frequently feeds screenshots of the app's UI into [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_vzer_for_app_and_content_development | Cursor]] to help it understand and fix UI issues or to guide it towards a desired design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **Feeding Documentation**: To reduce [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] hallucinations, especially in Apple-specific development, Chris continuously feeds relevant documentation into [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_vzer_for_app_and_content_development | Cursor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. This includes copying and pasting URLs for services like OpenRouter, allowing [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_vzer_for_app_and_content_development | Cursor]] to index the documentation and understand necessary API calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

### Prompt Engineering and LLM Selection

*   **Generating Prompts with [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | Claude]]**: Chris uses [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | Claude]] to generate high-quality prompts, as he finds it particularly good at this task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.
*   **XML Formatting for Prompts**: Formatting prompts in XML (e.g., using tags like `<persona>`, `<response_style>`) increases the chance of the LLM producing better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.
*   **Empathetic Prompting**: When asking [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] to respond, Chris prompts it to act "like a friend" and be concise, leading to a better user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

### Generating Realistic Mock Data

[[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] can generate less generic and more realistic mock data for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. For example, he prompted [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] to create mock transactions for a "28-year-old male in Dallas," which resulted in actual Dallas restaurants and realistic spending patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. This enhances the demo experience and allows for more effective testing of [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

## Implementing an AI Feature: Budgeting Chatbot

Chris demonstrates adding an [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] chat feature to his budgeting app, Luna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The goal is to allow users to ask questions about their spending history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

1.  **Initial UI Generation**: A prompt was used to create a new tab with an [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] chat UI, with hardcoded dummy data and matching the app's existing style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
2.  **Integrating OpenRouter**:
    *   OpenRouter is a service that allows switching between over 300 LLM models with a single line of code, enabling quick testing and cost comparison during development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
    *   A prompt was used to make the chat functional, integrate OpenRouter, and add a setting to toggle between models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
    *   The prompt also explicitly requested that the chat use the last three months of transactions as context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
    *   [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_vzer_for_app_and_content_development | Cursor]] generated a new `AIChartView` for the UI and an `OpenRouterServices` file for the backend logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
    *   API keys were placed in the front end for demo purposes but should ideally be in the backend for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.
3.  **Implementing Tool/Function Calling (Agents)**:
    *   To optimize costs and relevance, instead of feeding all transaction history every time, tool or function calling was implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>. This allows the LLM to access specific local tools (functions) within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.
    *   A prompt asked [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_vzer_for_app_and_content_development | Cursor]] to create tools like `get transactions for a specific date range` and `get current budget`, explicitly stating they should be local functions, not external API calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.
    *   The LLM first decides if it has enough context; if not, it checks if it has tools to get the necessary information, and then calls them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>. This process loops until relevant context is gathered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>.
    *   The LLM successfully used the `get transactions` tool to summarize spending over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a> and the `get current budget` tool to report on budget adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.
    *   This agent-like capability can be extended to modify budgets or even integrate with external APIs like Robinhood, making the [[ai_app_development_strategies | app]] highly interactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.
4.  **Displaying Cost and Token Usage**: A prompt requested that the app display the total tokens used and the cost for each chat interaction directly below the messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>. This was achieved by making a call to OpenRouter's generation endpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

## Asset Generation with [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | GPT-4o]]

Chris uses [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | GPT-4o]] for high-quality asset generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. He can take a primary mascot image and generate an infinite number of secondary assets for loading screens or empty states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>. By providing specific prompts (e.g., "wired glasses," "in front of a laptop"), he can create diverse images while maintaining the original style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>. This significantly adds visual polish to his [[ai_app_development_strategies | apps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] can also help brainstorm initial logo and mascot ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.

## Advice for Developers

*   **Embrace [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] Tooling**: Chris believes that skilled developers will benefit the most from [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. It is inevitable, and learning to use it is crucial for thriving in the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>.
*   **Caution for Non-Technical Users**: While non-developers can use [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] for development, Chris recommends using tools with more "guardrails" like Replit or Lovable, as [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_vzer_for_app_and_content_development | Cursor]] can be "dangerous" and lead to issues like hardcoding API keys in the front end, which can result in significant security risks and costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. He advises non-developers to learn programming basics and use [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] as a teacher to get better at fundamentals before using advanced tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.
*   **Humanize Your [[ai_app_development_strategies | App]]**: Don't just create bare-bones [[ai_app_development_strategies | apps]]; use [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] to "humanize" the product with elements like loading screens, welcome emails, and delightful touches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. You can even ask [[building_apps_using_ai_tools_like_claude_and_cursor | AI]] for ideas on how to add delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.

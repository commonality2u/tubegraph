From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

The traditional marketing funnel is an outdated and deceptive way to conceptualize modern marketing, as it fails to represent how people actually make purchasing decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Instead of a linear path, consumers interact with a brand, move away, and then get "sucked back in" for multiple rotations before a final purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This highlights a need for a new framework that accounts for non-linear buyer journeys and continuous engagement.

## Introducing Digital Gravity

Digital Gravity proposes a new way to visualize how to build brands and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. It posits that a company builds "digital mass" on the internet, and the more mass it accumulates, the greater its influence within its niche or sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This mass is primarily built through pervasive content creation and marketing everywhere the customer exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

The concept compares a brand to a planet, with customers as comets flying by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Initially, a small brand has no influence on passing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. However, as the brand gains more "mass," it attracts more people into its orbit, leading to more "touchdowns" or revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This creates a growth flywheel where generated revenue is reinvested to build even more mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

This approach emphasizes continuous marketing rather than finite "campaigns," a term inherited from military strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Marketing should be a constant activity, continuously adding mass to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This continuous process involves ongoing testing and allocating budget to the best-performing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Key Principles of Digital Gravity

*   **Continuous Engagement**: People interact with brands over extended periods, not in a single funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Ubiquitous Presence**: Marketing should occur everywhere the target customer spends time, both online and offline <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Content as a Vehicle**: Content is the primary means of building digital mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Adaptability**: Unlike email, most digital marketing efforts are malleable and can be constantly adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Volume and Surface Area**: Increasing the volume of content and marketing activities increases the "surface area" for customer interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## B2B Marketing with Digital Gravity

For B2B companies, a straightforward framework can be applied to build significant digital mass and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Tactical Plays for B2B

1.  **Audience Identification & Email Scraping**:
    *   Identify a smaller, targeted audience (e.g., 50,000 people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
    *   Scrape their emails using tools like Apollo.io or even LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

2.  **Targeted Advertising**:
    *   Import scraped emails into Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads to create custom match lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
    *   Run ads indefinitely in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
    *   Utilize [[using_ai_and_automation_in_marketing | AI Avatar ads]] (e.g., HeyGen for avatars, Eleven Labs for voice) to address pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
    *   Create 100+ variations of ads with different hooks, settings, and content to continuously test and optimize for lowest CPC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
    *   Founders becoming famous through these ads can be a strong leverage point, as people often buy from people, not just brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

3.  **Cold Email Outreach**:
    *   Cold email the entire scraped list simultaneously with ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
    *   Use specialized tools like MailReef (for server management) and Smartlead.ai or Instantly.ai (for sending) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
    *   Ensure **domain isolation** by using separate domains for transactional, newsletter, and cold emails to prevent core domain compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
    *   Cold emails should mirror ad messaging, focusing on problem-solution orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
    *   Despite common belief, cold email works, especially when messaging is highly specific and provides clear value to a small audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

4.  **Building a Media Arm**:
    *   Transform customer conversations and feedback into valuable content, ideally a podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
    *   Distribute podcast episodes via a newsletter to the scraped email list using tools like MailerLite or Beehiiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.
    *   This content, being industry-specific and educational, builds a media company around the brand, creating leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. For example, a health podcast grew to 180,000 downloads/month in 6 months, allowing Rupa Health to negotiate better deals with lab companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.
    *   The media arm can be monetized through ad placements, turning a cost center into a profit center (e.g., Athletic Greens subsidizing Rupa Health's growth team) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. This illustrates a "negative CAC" (Customer Acquisition Cost) strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
    *   Use [[using_ai_and_automation_in_marketing | AI tools]] (like Swell AI) to automate content creation: transcribing podcasts, generating show notes, clips, blog posts, and white papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.
    *   Distribute this content across all relevant social platforms (LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
    *   Run "Instagram only ads" with a direct call to action to "follow this account for more content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. This can acquire followers cheaply (e.g., 30 cents per follower) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
    *   The goal is to get free impressions from a larger audience, making ads feel like content rather than traditional advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.

5.  **Layering and Automation**:
    *   Simultaneously layer these growth curves (ads, cold email, media, social) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.
    *   Automate or delegate processes to achieve exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
    *   The combined effect of remarketing, consistent email outreach, daily social posts, and a strong media presence creates significant brand visibility and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.
    *   Consistent effort over time, despite initial slow progress, yields massive returns (e.g., an email list generating 80,000 website clicks per month for $450, compared to $500,000 in traditional ad spend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.
    *   Podcast listeners, by spending hours with a brand asynchronously, build immense trust, leading to high-value inbound leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

## Consumer (B2C) Marketing with Digital Gravity

[[consumer_marketing_strategies | Consumer marketing strategies]] are more competitive and require unbelievable marketing execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

### Tactical Plays for B2C

1.  **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**:
    *   A huge TAM is crucial for consumer success, as content needs to be broad enough to target a large subset of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.

2.  **App-Centric Approach**:
    *   Develop a single-purpose application that excels at one thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
    *   Consider a pricing strategy like $7.99/week (translates to ~$29/month) which can act as an impulse purchase and yield three months of revenue upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

3.  **Conversion-Focused Advertising**:
    *   Run Facebook Ads and TikTok Ads focusing on deep links for app installs and in-app actions (signup, paid action) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
    *   Continuously test different ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

4.  **[[influencer_marketing_and_consumer_engagement | Influencer Marketing]] and UGC**:
    *   Hire UGC creators (e.g., 5-10 creators at $1,000/month for a video a day) to create content that serves as a test bed for viral potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>.
    *   This content should use a hook, pain point, and present the product as the hero, feeling more like entertainment than an ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.
    *   Spin up multiple (e.g., 10) TikTok accounts and remix best-performing UGC content using [[using_ai_and_automation_in_marketing | AI tools]] like ChatGPT (scripts), HeyGen (videos), and Eleven Labs (audio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
    *   Crucially, pick a unique product name to avoid competition on Google search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.

5.  **Website Pixeling & Remarketing**:
    *   Pixel visitors to the website (Facebook, TikTok, Google pixels) to run ads to them indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.
    *   This builds a larger audience and allows for targeted remarketing based on their expressed interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>.
    *   Include clear calls to action (sign up/install app) and email opt-ins on the website for a nurture sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

6.  **[[digital_influencers_and_brand_engagement | Influencer Outreach]] and Affiliates**:
    *   Scrape emails of [[digital_influencers_and_brand_engagement | YouTube]] and Instagram creators in your category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>.
    *   Perform cold outreach to inquire about pricing, identify arbitrage opportunities (where views vs. cost are disproportionate), and establish affiliate deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.
    *   A common deal structure is a three-video package plus a 30% recurring affiliate commission, which creates stickiness and a moat against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.
    *   Working with influencers offers a significant discount on CPM (Cost Per Mille) compared to direct ad buying (e.g., $5 CPM through influencers vs. $10 average on TikTok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.

7.  **Programmatic SEO**:
    *   As the app's website builds domain authority (trust measured by backlinks), leverage programmatic SEO for organic traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
    *   Target longtail, low-difficulty keywords (e.g., diet plans, nutrition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.
    *   Use [[using_ai_and_automation_in_marketing | AI]] to scrape top-ranking content, create outlines, and write thousands of articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.
    *   Have human SEO specialists refine articles only once they start receiving traffic, balancing Google's ranking factors with human readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.
    *   Embed calls to action prominently within these articles (e.g., after the first paragraph, in pop-ups) to drive app sign-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>. This also contributes to the remarketing audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

### Conclusion

Building a strong digital gravity requires continuous effort, layering various marketing strategies, and leveraging automation to create an omnipresent brand presence. This approach helps companies, whether B2B or B2C, establish "mental real estate" in the minds of their target audience, leading to sustainable and exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.

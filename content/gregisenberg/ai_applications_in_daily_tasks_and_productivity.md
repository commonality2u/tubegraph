His studio generates an estimated $15 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) with several apps boasting hundreds of thousands to millions of monthly users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Blake Anderson's Journey and Key Apps
Anderson stumbled into the AI app space a little over a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. His successful applications include:
*   **Riz GPT (now Plug AI)**: Scaled to over 3 million downloads and $200,000 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **UMAX**: Achieved over 10 million downloads and peaked at around $700,000 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Cal AI**: Launched just over six months prior to the discussion, it reached about 2 million downloads and over $1 million in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Cal AI focuses on the functionality of calorie tracking, aiming to make an archaic industry easier with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

The success in this space is attributed to the intersection of new AI functionality and novel distribution tactics, largely pioneered by e-commerce methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## The Opportunity in AI Apps
AI is currently just scratching the surface of new application functionality that can be delivered to end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. [[ai_tools_for_building_software | AI tools]] like GPT Vision allow for the creation of technologies that previously required significant investment in proprietary machine learning models, enabling development with essentially zero upfront cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. AI enables personalized and real-time updated functionality through AI backends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## AI App Ideas for Daily Tasks and Productivity

### 1. Career AI
This application would serve as an all-in-one integrated platform for career advancement, combining fragmented tools into one service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Functionality**:
    *   **Resume Analysis**: Scans resumes and provides tips for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. To make it viral, a "six-factor Madden rating system" could be implemented, giving scores based on different resume sections, aligning with popular ed-tech content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.
    *   **Career Analysis**: A quiz that recommends future careers based on personality, with a visually appealing screen displaying results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This could be used to create viral content on social media by highlighting surprising or affirming career recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: A subscription model, potentially $50 a month, for an all-in-one tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Distribution**: Standard Instagram/TikTok Reels, targeting students, along with leveraging Twitter/X.com and LinkedIn for untapped channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### 2. Journal AI
A potential [[ai_journaling_applications | AI journaling application]] that acts as an AI "second brain," branded as a journal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   **Functionality**:
    *   Provides analysis to increase productivity, offer emotional support, and analyze relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
    *   Essentially a ChatGPT backend with more complex memory storage and a UI conducive to journaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
    *   Offers intricate, objective analysis back to the user, unlike traditional journals where input yields no direct analytical output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   **Naming Strategy**: While "Journal AI" is a straightforward name for discussion, a more friendly name like "Juny" or "Journey" could be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. Adding "AI" to a product name can be valuable for innovative products in stagnant industries (e.g., Cal AI) but should be avoided where 100% accuracy is critical, as it might raise skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

### 3. Language AI / Language Tutoring Application
This idea aims to capture market share from large language learning apps like Duolingo by integrating new AI functionality more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.
*   **Functionality**:
    *   Utilizes advanced AI voice models (like ChatGPT's voice model) for interactive tutoring, anticipating future cost decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
    *   Builds a UI around dynamic learning, contrasting with Duolingo's generally more static modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
*   **Competitive Edge**: Despite established players like Duolingo adding AI features, smaller, more agile teams can iterate and progress faster due to different internal incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. The goal is to capture a small percentage of a massive market, potentially creating a new market share rather than directly competing for existing users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>.

## Blake Anderson's Framework for Building Mainstream AI Apps

### 1. Iterative Virality and Distribution
*   **Concept**: Continuously generate virality from early on by creating new hooks and positioning the product for different target audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Split Testing**: Split test different hooks across various videos, creators, and niches. Assess views, conversion rates, and engagement to inform future distribution strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This is akin to how platforms like Meta and TikTok split test creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **Influencer Marketing**: Prioritize developing personal relationships with influencers rather than relying solely on marketplaces or agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. While quantity is important early on, treating influencers well and becoming friends can lead to endless opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### 2. Product Fleshing Out
*   **Ideation for Virality**: Begin the ideation process by considering what tools or features will perform well on social media and engineering the product around that virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   **Design Process**: Start with wireframes, then convert them into more fleshed-out UI designs using professional designers or freelancers (e.g., from Upwork) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **Building**: For those starting without capital, [[ai_tools_for_app_development | AI tools]] like ChatGPT can teach coding (e.g., Swift UI for iOS, React Native) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. This enables individuals to [[using_ai_for_app_development | build iOS apps using AI tools]] and other software with minimal upfront costs.

### 3. Monetization Strategy (Paywalls)
*   **Tooling**: Superwall is highly recommended for its ease of split testing paywalls and providing data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.
*   **Optimization Thesis**: Instead of optimizing solely for profit per user, prioritize optimizing for the number of users to dominate the market more quickly and increase immeasurable Word of Mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. This involves accepting a lower lifetime value (LTV) per download in exchange for wider platform usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.
*   **Placement**: The most standard and efficient practice is to guide users through an onboarding flow (e.g., quizzes, personal information input) and then present a paywall at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. While this can feel extractive to users, it significantly increases conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

## Generating More AI App Ideas
*   **Market Analysis**: Use tools like Sensor Tower to assess the size and landscape of other players in a given space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.
*   **Personal Practices**:
    *   **Thinking Clearly**: Engage in activities that promote clear thinking, such as hiking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.
    *   **Deliberate Social Media Scrolling**: Curate social media feeds (e.g., by creating burner accounts) around specific interests to immerse oneself in the content and user mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.
*   **Observation**: Look at everyday activities and industries (e.g., calorie tracking, language learning, journaling) and identify opportunities to apply an "AI twist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.
*   **MVP Approach**: Build small Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) rather than trying to "boil the ocean" to get something out quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

The most obvious ideas, when combined with new execution styles in functionality and distribution, can lead to the creation of massive applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>. The current landscape offers a unique opportunity to build [[applications_of_ai_in_business_and_startups | AI-first apps]] and pioneer new ways for people to learn and improve themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for ad creation can significantly boost a business's Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and overall profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. With tools like ChatGPT 4o, businesses can create high-quality, winning ads and visual content in a matter of minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

## AI for Ad Creation with ChatGPT 4o

ChatGPT 4o is a multimodal language model that excels at understanding intent and creativity when generating images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. It allows marketers to create ads that are ready for ad accounts quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

### Key Elements for Effective AI Ad Generation

The most crucial aspects for creating effective ads with AI are the inspiration images and the product images provided to the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### Prompting Strategies

While ChatGPT 4o is intelligent, specific prompting strategies can enhance results:
*   **Use Inspiration Images**: Provide a reference ad you wish to adjust or use as a template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Provide Custom Product Images**: Integrate your own product imagery to ensure brand consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **Be Direct**: Simple, straightforward prompts are often effective because the model understands intent well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. For example, "add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **Keyword for Realism**: Include "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to prevent cartoonish or oddly colored outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.
*   **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide a strong, detailed prose description of your desired image when not using a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **Font and Style Specification**: For well-known fonts, specifying the font type (e.g., "font type exo2 bold italic") can yield decent representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. Similarly, you can adjust color styles and aspect ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Consecutive Adjustments in the Same Chat**: If an initial prompt is unsatisfactory, start a new chat for adjustments. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to a degradation of image quality as the AI uses its own generated image as a flawed reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.
*   **Specific Image Generation**: Use the instruction "generate the image" to ensure the AI produces an image rather than text that describes the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>.

### When to Use Reference Images

AI models have a strong understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands like Nike or Adidas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:22]</a>. For such brands, prompting without a reference image might suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. However, for newer, smaller products with limited online presence (i.e., not millions of dollars in ad spend per month), providing a reference image is always recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.

## Experimentation at Scale

The goal of [[digital_marketing_strategies_for_newsletters | digital marketing]] is to create ads that convert, which is largely a game of experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. AI allows for experimentation at scale, enabling the rapid generation of numerous ad variations to test different audiences (men, women, old, young, diverse complexions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. This can significantly impact ROAS, potentially turning a 1.6 ROAS into a 2.8 ROAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

> "The ad is the targeting." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>

The ability to generate hundreds of ads in minutes trivializes the process once AI APIs are widely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This allows for highly personalized and entertaining ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>.

## Adapting Existing Ads

AI enables easy modification of existing ad concepts, such as:
*   **Product Swaps**: Replace a product in an existing ad with your own, while maintaining the overall ad structure and style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.
*   **Seasonal/Thematic Adjustments**: Transform an ad to fit a different holiday or theme (e.g., changing a Black Friday ad to a Christmas ad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>.
*   **News Cycle Leverage**: Companies can quickly create ads based on current news cycles, a process that was previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. AI can potentially monitor news feeds and generate relevant ads on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.

> [14:53:00] "It somehow feels dirty though... that other company Rise spent all this time and money maybe even tens of thousands of dollars figuring out this ad an ad copy and then in like a few seconds we're I mean we're kind of we're remixing it into you know for AG1."

> [15:26:00] "The way that most of these companies work is they are finding inspiration ads... people were looking for inspiration, they were using templates, now Chat GPT just does it for you... this just makes it a bit more accessible to anyone but it was already happening."

## Tools for Ad Inspiration

Several platforms offer ad inspiration and templating:
*   Creative OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>
*   ForPlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>
*   Icon.me <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:00]</a>

These tools read and tag the Meta ad library, making it easy to search for inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>.

## Ideation and Workflow

The ability to rapidly generate ad concepts can jumpstart creative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. The current strategy is to find an aesthetic not yet widely used in a particular niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.

### Sora for Prompt Exploration and Remixing

Sora, while using the same underlying model as ChatGPT, offers an explore page where users can view images and their corresponding prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. This is an excellent resource for:
*   Understanding how effective prompts are structured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.
*   Gaining inspiration and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.
*   Remixing existing images by adjusting prompts or aspect ratios, or uploading new reference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.
*   It also seems to have less strict policy guidelines and better photo realism compared to some other models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

### Iterative Process

While some prompts can lead to a "one-shot" success, especially with strict instructions and well-known products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:00">[31:10:00]</a>, more complex or vague requests might require two to three iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>. AI models tend to have low "temperature" (randomness), meaning similar prompts will yield similar responses, allowing for consistent adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>.

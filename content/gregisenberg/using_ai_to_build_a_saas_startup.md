Ras Mike shares insights on effectively interacting with AI models and understanding fundamental web development concepts to achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Getting the Most Out of AI Tools

Many individuals struggle when [[leveraging_ai_in_startup_development | using AI tools]] because the models may "hallucinate" or provide incorrect outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The key to success is to improve how you interact with these tools, similar to how a product manager defines requirements for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Adopting a "Product Manager" Mindset

When interacting with an AI model, envision yourself as a product manager providing specifications to a developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. In traditional corporate tech environments, product managers define what needs to be built with extreme precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Developers, while providing input, primarily build based on these defined requirements, often summarized in a Product Requirement Document (PRD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

AI models, though trained on vast amounts of data, are "dumb" in that they don't know what's in your mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Expecting a detailed output from a single, vague prompt (e.g., "build this for me") is like daydreaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

To avoid burning credits or getting irrelevant outputs, it's crucial to:
*   Collect all necessary information, including desired flows, specific features, and the core product concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   Define features with extreme precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Study product management principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   Advocate for the user by picking a niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

### Understanding Web Basics

Having a basic understanding of web technologies, even without learning to code, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This knowledge helps identify where problems might arise when prompting AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

The web typically consists of three main sections for a functional application:
1.  **Client Side (Frontend)**: What the user sees and interacts with, such as a website's user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Tools like V0 can generate frontend elements like landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
2.  **Server Side (Backend)**: Where complex logic, APIs, and business operations occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
3.  **Data Storage (Database)**: Where all application data is stored, such as user information or saved content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

Many users start by only prompting for frontend elements (e.g., "create a landing page") without providing instructions for the backend or database, resulting in limited functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Backend as a Service (BaaS)

Backend as a Service (BaaS) companies address the complexity of server-side development. They handle crucial aspects like security and scalability, which are often the most challenging parts of [[starting_a_saas_business_using_ai_tools | building a SaaS business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Examples include Superbase, Slepton, and Convex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. These services manage the server and database, allowing developers to focus primarily on the client side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

*   **Convex** excels in real-time applications, such as chat or collaborative tools, where immediate data updates are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Superbase** is highly regarded for its Postgress database offerings and excellent developer experience (DX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

When choosing between BaaS providers, it's beneficial to ask an AI model like ChatGPT or Claude which one is best suited for a specific use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

By combining AI-driven frontend generation with a BaaS, you can build a full-stack application that includes authentication, data storage, and potentially payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Lovable: A New AI Development Tool

Lovable is a new AI developer tool that simplifies the process of [[building_a_startup_using_ai_tools | building a SaaS startup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Its key advantage is a direct integration with Superbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This allows users to set up their backend, database, and authentication with just one prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

### Demonstration: Building a Note-Taking SaaS for Founders

A live demonstration shows the process of creating a note-taking SaaS using Lovable and Superbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>:

1.  **Initial Prompt**: "I want to build a not taking SaaS for Founders. There should be a user authentication, there should be a nice clean landing page explaining why Founder need my SaaS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.
2.  **Superbase Integration**: Lovable provides a direct button to connect to a Superbase project. This automatically sets up authentication and database tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
3.  **Authentication**: With Superbase connected, Lovable enables user sign-up and login with options like email/password or social logins (e.g., Discord, Figma, Notion, Twitch, Slack, Spotify) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. This process includes creating database tables, writing role-level security, and implementing policies, all of which are complex tasks done automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
4.  **Note-Taking Page**: A prompt like "create the note taking page and make it so that only authenticated users can access it" creates the necessary UI and database tables for storing notes, linked to the user's ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>.
5.  **Navigation and Flows**: Prompts are used to add navigation bars and define user flows, ensuring users are directed to the correct pages after signing in or signing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>.
6.  **Deployment**: The application can be deployed publicly with a single click, creating a fully functional SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.

This process demonstrates how quickly a full-stack application with a client, server, and database can be built, especially with the hardest parts (authentication and database) being made easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.

## The Future of AI in Startup Development

The speaker predicts that in the coming months, more AI tools will integrate directly with BaaS platforms and payment services like Stripe, making payments the final "beast to conquer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This means many current complexities of integration will become redundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

The true competitive advantage, or "moat," for [[identifying_ai_saas_startup_opportunities | AI SaaS startups]] will shift from technical building to **design** and **user experience (UX)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. If an application offers a richer, better experience and genuinely solves a problem, it will succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. **Distribution** is also highlighted as a crucial moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

The ability to **be a great product person**—seeing a great product, understanding its fantastic user experience, and communicating that precisely to an AI model—will be the defining skill for future "winners" in the AI space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. This new landscape will enable "non-technical multi-million dollar founders with no CTO" to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

While AI tools rapidly accelerate development, human engineers still have an edge in creating more performant and faster applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. However, this gap is expected to close in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. Additionally, developers should prioritize **security**, especially when handling user data, as future regulations may mandate adherence to security policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.# [[using_ai_to_build_saas_apps | Using AI to Build a SaaS Startup]]

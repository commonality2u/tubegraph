The rapid development of [[AIpowered mobile apps | AI-powered mobile apps]] has led to new opportunities, particularly in niche markets like dating and companionship. Entrepreneurs are leveraging [[Building apps using AI tools | AI tools]] to create applications with significant revenue streams, even with lean teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Rise of AI-Enabled Dating Apps

A prominent example is the "Riz app" (later clarified as Plug AI) which operates as an [[AIenabled dating apps | AI-enabled dating app]] coach built on top of Chat GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This app reportedly achieved $190,000 per month in revenue and 333,000 downloads per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The 23-year-old founder reportedly got the idea from a Tinder subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The success of such [[AI app startup ideas | AI app startup ideas]] is attributed less to complex product features and more to effective marketing, strong branding, and virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. For instance, the name "Riz" (meaning charm or attractiveness) itself resonated with its target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### AI RZ and its Portfolio

The founder of the app, operating under the company "AI RZ," has launched three apps, collectively closing in on $500,000 of revenue per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. These include:

*   **Plug AI:** A texting assistant described as the "ultimate AI Riz." Users can upload screenshots of text messages, and the app generates pickup lines based on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Astra:** An [[AI agents and their applications | AI agent]] offering life advice and companionship. It helps users work through challenges, discuss compatibility, learn about personal growth, and explore dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Pallet:** Uses [[AIpowered mobile apps | state-of-the-art AI]] to determine a user's color season from a selfie and generates a custom color palette, personalized style, and makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

These apps demonstrate a strategy of focusing on specific verticals for AI coaching, leveraging existing technology rather than building complex new systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Sustainability and Risks

While these [[AI app development strategies | AI app development strategies]] generate significant revenue, concerns about their sustainability exist. The business model relies heavily on underlying platforms like Open AI (ChatGPT), which could change their pricing or terms, potentially impacting profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

However, proponents argue that even if such apps are "flash in the pan" successes, they provide substantial financial gains and valuable business experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. For many, achieving financial stability, such as being able to retire parents or buy a first house, is a primary goal, often referred to as getting one's "first nut" or base capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.

> "Sometimes you need to change your world before you change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>

### The Anti-Trend: Human-Powered Services

An interesting counter-movement, or "anti-trend," to the proliferation of AI-powered services is the demand for human-led alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. For example, while an [[AI voice character apps | AI dating coach]] offers convenience and scalability, there could be a significant market for human dating coaches or style consultants, potentially at a higher price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. These human-centric businesses may face less competition compared to the crowded [[AI app startup ideas | AI app development]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

User experience (UX) design for applications focuses on creating a product that is intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. It encompasses everything from the initial framing and navigation to how the app's features are presented and how it retains users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Core UX Principles

### Simplicity and Digestibility
A key principle is to make everything very digestible to the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. This involves designing simple apps and simple screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. For example, using a numerical scale like a "0 to five danger level" is more easily understood than a text description like "fairly dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. When designing questions for a quiz, a series of multiple-choice questions with four answers is preferable to open-ended questions with check boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

### Leveraging Primitives (UI Building Blocks)
When designing a new app, a common strategy is to identify existing "Primitives" or fundamental building blocks from other successful apps and repurpose them for the new use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This means observing what works well in similar applications and adapting those elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. For example, the scanning lines seen in apps like PhotoMath were not invented for [[ai_app_development | Cal AI]], but rather adapted from many other applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Chatbot UIs can also be directly pulled from existing designs on the App Store without needing to reinvent the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

### User Investment and Retention
Building an investment in the product is crucial for user retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Features that store user history or data can make users more likely to stick with an app, even if competitors emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. For a health-related app like Dr. AI, a history feature could store previous chats, scan results, and symptoms quiz outcomes, which users could even show to a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The ability for users to follow up on previous results by asking more questions also increases retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

## Specific UI Elements and Flow (Dr. AI Case Study)

When designing the Dr. AI app, a basic framing approach was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

*   **Navigation Bar**: A standard navigation bar with "Home" and "Settings" is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Feature Buttons**: The app's main features (scan, chat, symptoms quiz) would have dedicated buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **History Feed**: A "History" section acts as a log, similar to an "inscript feed" of a user's interactions, displaying previous chats, scans, and quiz results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Scan Skin Flow**:
    *   Immediately directs to a camera screen for scanning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
    *   Includes an upload button for photos from the camera roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
    *   Uses scan lines to indicate the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
    *   **Crucial Improvement**: Instead of forcing users to wait on a loading screen, the app should take the user back to the home screen and show a loading indicator there, especially for processes taking 30-60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Scan Results Display**:
    *   Shows the image taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
    *   Displays a "0 to five danger level" metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
    *   Provides a diagnosis from the AI, explaining what it is and its likelihood of being harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
    *   Includes an "Ask Question" button to initiate a deeper chat about the specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
    *   Optionally, could include sources for the information, similar to Perplexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

## Broader UX Considerations

### Designing for Marketing
UX design should consider how the app will be marketed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Simplicity**: An app must be clear and simple enough for someone to understand its value quickly, especially if shown for only a couple of seconds in an influencer video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   **Branding**: The app's name should be prominently displayed on the homepage and especially on "wow factor" screens (like the scan result screen) that influencers are likely to show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.
*   **"Wow Factor"**: Identify the specific feature that will most impress the audience and design that screen to be visually impactful and clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. For Dr. AI, the skin scan with a danger level and diagnosis is the primary "wow factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. This process involves [[strategies_for_growing_consumer_mobile_apps | reverse engineering]] how an influencer will present the product and designing the product around that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

### Ethical Considerations and Accuracy
When designing [[ai_app_development | AI app development]] apps, especially in sensitive areas like health, it is critical to include disclaimers about accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While AI (like ChatGPT) can be good at diagnosing medical problems, it can also "hallucinate" or provide generic responses, and it's essential to work around these limitations through careful prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The goal of an app like Dr. AI should be to help users decide if they need to see a doctor, not to provide definitive diagnoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Accuracy is paramount; developers must ensure the AI's responses are reliable, as inaccurate information can have serious consequences for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

### Design Tools
Tools like Figma can be used for the UX design process, even if the designer is not an expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. The focus should be on clear placement and communicating the idea, with professional designers then refining the aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

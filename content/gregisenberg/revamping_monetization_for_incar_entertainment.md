The current model for in-car entertainment, exemplified by "Play Octopus" tablets found in the back of Uber headrests, primarily focuses on trivia games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>. Its [[monetization_strategies_for_content_creators | monetization strategy]] relies on displaying ads between trivia segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. While the product creates a better experience for passengers and drivers due to increased "ride vibes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a> and low churn rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>, driver earnings are minimal, typically around $70 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. Despite Play Octopus being acquired by T-Mobile in 2022 and generating revenues of $8-10 million annually, its ad model primarily uses basic display ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>.

## Proposed Monetization Revamp

A significant opportunity exists to improve the [[monetization_and_revenue_on_youtube | monetization]] of in-car entertainment, potentially transforming it into a "cash printing" type of company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>. The core idea is to pivot from display ads to performance-based advertising, leveraging the current widespread familiarity with QR codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.

### Shifting to CPA/CPL Models

Instead of simple display ads, the suggested model involves:

*   **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) Ads**: Displaying CPA ads with QR codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>. When a user scans the QR code and provides their contact information (phone number or email), an affiliate commission is paid to both the in-car entertainment company and the Uber driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. This provides a strong incentive for drivers to switch platforms, potentially increasing their earnings from $70 to an extra $500 or even $1000 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.
*   **Cost Per Lead (CPL) Model**: Ads could be based on CPL, where a grocery store or tire shop, for example, pays for the right to message a lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>. Multiple businesses can bundle together to buy the same lead for a higher payout (e.g., $6 instead of $2), sharing the list of contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>. Users could be enticed to scan QR codes for free content like an e-book or PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.

### Strategic Implementation

*   **Affiliate Network Integration**: Tapping into existing affiliate networks like CJ (Commission Junction) can provide a wide range of CPA offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>.
*   **Targeted Advertising**: The platform could focus on highly targeted audiences, such as sports fans heading to a game, who are likely to engage with sports betting offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>.
*   **Network Effect**: The natural network effect among drivers, who are often part of online groups, would accelerate adoption. As drivers see peers earning significantly more, they would encourage others to adopt the new system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.
*   **Free Tablet Distribution**: Tablets could be provided free to drivers, ensuring wide adoption as they immediately start generating income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>.

By finding products with poor [[monetization_and_building_sustainable_businesses | monetization]] and implementing a more effective, performance-based ad strategy, in-car entertainment could become a much more lucrative venture, potentially growing from an $8-10 million business to a $50 million business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.

### Potential for Gambling/Prediction Markets

A more controversial, but potentially highly profitable, idea is to turn the in-car screens into "casinos" offering mini-games or prediction market betting (e.g., on election results) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>. With the increasing legality of betting, partnerships with betting companies like FanDuel could offer free betting credits with QR codes, capturing a "lit" and engaged audience, especially those heading to sports events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. This approach could lead to a "hundred million dollar company" due to the high engagement and conversion rates from a captured audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>.

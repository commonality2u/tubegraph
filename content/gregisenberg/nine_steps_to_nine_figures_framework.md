The "Nine Steps to Nine Figures" framework is designed to help founders [[scaling_a_business_from_zero_to_100_million | scale a business]] beyond seven figures, aiming for a $100 million valuation or exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. It emphasizes the necessary transition from being a product-led founder to building a comprehensive company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Most people have about five years of dedicated, focused, obsessive energy to put into their business to achieve this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Phases of Business Growth

The framework breaks down the journey to nine figures into three distinct phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>:

1.  **Startup**: This phase covers everything up to achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Persona**: Deeply understanding who you are selling to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Every business should start with understanding its market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. This means analyzing customer data, identifying trends among top customers, and understanding their pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:10:00">[38:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Product**: Defining what you are selling to that identified market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
    *   **Promotion**: How you plan to sell at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
    *   Product-market fit is achieved when it feels like "you're wearing a meat suit in a dog park," meaning you have more leads than you know what to do with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

2.  **Scale-up**: This phase focuses on company creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. It's the "sweet spot" for growth, typically from mid-seven figures to $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

3.  **Grow-up**: This final phase is about legacy protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>, scaling beyond $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## The [[triple_triple_double_double_revenue_growth_strategy | Triple Triple Double Double Revenue Growth Strategy]]

This strategy outlines a path to take a business from $3 million to over $100 million in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. It involves tripling revenue three times and then doubling it twice:
*   Start with a $3 million business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   Triple to $9 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   Triple again to $27 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   Double to $54 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   Double again to $108 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

At $108 million, a business has significant optionality for a $100 million exit or continued growth towards market domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Elements of the Scale-up Phase

The scale-up phase (mid-seven figures to $100 million) focuses on three key components: **Process, People, and Performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

### Process

Building a highly optimized, automated, and often software-driven business is crucial. The goal is to avoid bureaucracy and reliance on too many people, especially with the capabilities of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. The developer of "GoldenEye" for Nintendo 64 built the game with only 12 people, demonstrating that large teams aren't always necessary for significant achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

### People

Focus on acquiring a handful of "A-players" who are enjoyable to work with, rather than building a large, bureaucratic team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. When hiring, prioritize filling strategic gaps and bottlenecks in the business. The two core functions of any business are **sales** and **delivery** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:14:00">[42:14:00]</a>.

### Performance

It's the founder's job to manage performance by providing a "scoreboard" to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. This includes clear incentives, compensation packages, and strategic guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. As Charlie Munger said, "Show me the incentive, I'll show you the outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

#### Structuring Incentive Programs

A common mistake in incentive structures is focusing solely on profit or revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.
*   **Profit-only incentives** can lead to excessive cost-cutting without thinking about growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue-only incentives** can lead to growth at the expense of profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

The ideal structure is a **50/50 split** between top-line (revenue) and bottom-line (profit) performance, ensuring founder alignment and a balanced approach to growth and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

#### Equity vs. Cash Compensation

Harvard research suggests no marked increase in performance when employees are given equity, primarily because most employees don't understand how to value it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.

A better approach is to present a total compensation package and allow the employee to decide how much of it will be cash bonus versus equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. This approach makes the equity feel like an investment, creating genuine skin in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.

## Importance of Fundamentals

Ignoring foundational aspects early on is like "building a skyscraper on a sandy foundation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. This can lead to increased churn, heightened competition, and founder burnout in the mid-seven figures phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. Focusing on these fundamentals from the start is crucial for long-term scalability and preventing company collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.

## Combating Churn: Focus on Loyalty

Instead of fixating on "churn," focus on **loyalty** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. The key metric for loyalty is **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.
*   Every 3% increase in NRR can double a company's valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>.
*   NRR measures how much more an existing customer cohort spends over time, rather than just preventing churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>.
*   Examples include Slack and AWS, where usage-based pricing or increased feature adoption leads to higher spend over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>.

Prioritizing retention upfront makes it easier to grow a business by ensuring incredible customer loyalty before "throwing gasoline on the fire" with promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>. It's like not building a "leaky ship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>.

## Growth Tactics

Once retention is solid, growth can be approached strategically:
*   **Retention-driven Growth**: If pricing is proper and NRR is positive, a company will naturally experience growth even without aggressive promotion, as existing customers spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>.
*   **Marketing Portfolio Approach**: Treat marketing channels like an investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.
    *   **80%** of investment should go to "index funds" – proven channels that consistently produce results year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.
    *   **20%** should be allocated to "rocket ships" – experimental channels with the potential for massive future returns (e.g., the next Nvidia or Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>. This diversifies risk and ensures backup channels if a primary one falters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>.

## Strategic Decision-Making: Impact vs. Effort

A key framework for decision-making, including potential acquisitions, is the **Impact vs. Effort Matrix** (also called Shield versus Sword) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>.
*   Evaluate potential opportunities (e.g., acquiring a $50M revenue business) by ranking both the effort required (e.g., due diligence, integration) and the potential impact on the business, typically on a 1-5 scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a>.
*   Optimize for "low-hanging fruit" – activities that require low effort but have a massive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>.
*   Be wary of "shiny object syndrome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a>; internal opportunities often yield higher ROI than external ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:00">[26:10:00]</a>.
*   The framework helps founders filter out distractions and align new opportunities with their overall strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>.

## Founder vs. CEO Mentality

*   **Founders** are "artists" who "found" and "build" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:59:00">[31:59:00]</a>. Their genius is in discovering new products or market fits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>. The problem arises when founders abandon a "flight" (successful product/business) to invent the next new thing, instead of scaling the current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:17:00">[32:17:00]</a>.
*   **CEOs** are "managers" who successfully scale what the founder has built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:29:00">[32:29:00]</a>. Their job is to effectively hand off the baton, hiring COOs or Presidents to execute the vision, or even a CEO if their passion isn't in scaling that particular business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:33:00">[32:33:00]</a>.
*   The ultimate goal for a CEO is to have nothing on their plate, thinking multiple quarters or even years ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:16:00">[46:16:00]</a>.

### Identifying Your Zone of Genius

To determine if you should remain as CEO or hand over the reins, identify your "zone of genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:30:00">[44:30:00]</a>:
*   Where do you get excited on your calendar? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:43:00">[44:43:00]</a>
*   What topics do you tinker with in the morning before meetings? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:00">[44:51:00]</a>
*   What areas do you find yourself actively reading about or jumping on calls for (e.g., sales, customer calls)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:54:00">[44:54:00]</a>
*   What activities give you energy versus those that drain it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:27:00">[45:27:00]</a>

Once you identify your zone, hire executives for functions outside of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:10:00">[43:10:00]</a>. For example, if your genius is sales, hire a COO for operations. If you hire someone in your zone of genius, you know what greatness looks like and can properly train them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:24:00">[43:24:00]</a>.

## Focus and Domination

*   **Build Skyscrapers, Not Strip Malls**: Instead of creating multiple new business units (like "product studios" or "multipreneurs"), focus on expanding and deepening an existing successful business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:30:00">[33:30:00]</a>.
*   **Be the Best**: Markets often only reward the winner or "gold medalist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a>. Before entering any market or deciding to focus, ask if you can be the best in that specific arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:18:00">[36:18:00]</a>. This requires intense focus and dedication, often for five years, to achieve a life-changing exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>.

An example of hyper-niching and relentless focus is AppSumo's shift in 2017. By analyzing customer data, they found that marketing agencies were their most profitable segment, buying software to reduce monthly expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:19:00">[38:19:00]</a>. AppSumo then used a "test then invest" framework, increasing software deals from one per quarter to one per day, leading to a tripled business valuation, increased customer loyalty, and slashed customer acquisition costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>. This focused strategy improved every KPI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:02:00">[40:02:00]</a>. Founders should dedicate 20% of their money, time, and energy to such experiments to discover new revenue channels, which they then scale by hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:20:00">[40:20:00]</a>.

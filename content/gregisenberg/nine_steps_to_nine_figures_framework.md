The "Nine steps to nine figures" is a framework designed to guide founders through the process of scaling a business beyond seven figures, aiming for a $100 million valuation or exit within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This framework emphasizes a transition from being a product-led founder to building a comprehensive company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## The Triple Triple Double Double Revenue Growth Strategy

To achieve a $100 million business in five years, the [[triple_triple_double_double_revenue_growth_strategy | Triple Triple Double Double]] strategy is proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This involves:
*   Tripling revenue three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   Then doubling revenue twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

For example, starting with a $3 million business:
*   Year 1: 3x to $9 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>
*   Year 2: 3x to $27 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>
*   Year 3: 3x to $81 million (though the example states $27 million and then doubling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>
*   Year 4: 2x from $27 million to $54 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>
*   Year 5: 2x from $54 million to $108 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>

This trajectory offers significant optionality for a $100 million exit or continued growth and market domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

## Three Phases of Business Growth

The [[nine_steps_to_nine_figures_framework | Nine steps to nine figures framework]] outlines three distinct phases:

### 1. Startup Phase
This phase focuses on achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. It involves:
*   **Persona:** Identifying who you are selling to (the market) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **Product:** Defining what you are selling to that market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   **Promotion:** Determining how to sell at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

Product-market fit is achieved when a business has more leads than it can handle, akin to "wearing a meat suit in a dog park" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

### 2. Scale-Up Phase
This phase centers on company creation, moving from mid-seven figures towards $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. It emphasizes:
*   **Process:** Building highly optimized, automated, and software-driven systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>, ideally leveraging AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
*   **People:** Hiring a handful of "A players" rather than focusing on a large team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. The focus is on process first, then people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
*   **Performance:** Managing outcomes by providing a "scoreboard" with clear incentives and compensation packages for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

### 3. Grow-Up Phase
This final phase is about legacy protection, moving beyond $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. It represents a different way of running the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## Core Principles for Scaling

### Prioritizing Loyalty and Retention
Founders often make the mistake of prioritizing growth over retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. It is easier to grow a business with strong customer loyalty, which acts as "gasoline on that fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

Instead of focusing on churn, the emphasis should be on loyalty, measured by Net Revenue Retention (NRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. A 3% increase in NRR can double a company's valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. NRR means existing customers spend more over time, for example, by adding more users or features, as seen with Slack or AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Building a strong foundation with retention and brand equity upfront is crucial before accelerating promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

### Incentive Structures
For executives, an ideal compensation structure is a 50/50 split between top-line revenue growth and bottom-line profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. This aligns the executive's goals with the founder's, encouraging consideration for both growth and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.

#### Equity vs. Cash for Employees
Harvard research suggests no significant increase in performance when employees receive equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>, as many employees do not understand how to value it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

A suggested approach for equity is to present it as part of a total compensation package, allowing the employee to decide how much of their bonus is cash versus equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. For example, if a VP of Revenue has a $400,000 total comp package with a $100,000 base, they decide how to allocate the remaining $300,000 between cash bonus and equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. This approach makes the equity tangible and fosters "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

### Marketing Channel Allocation (80/20 Rule)
Marketing efforts should be treated like an investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>.
*   **80%** of resources (money, time, energy) should be allocated to established channels that consistently produce results, acting like "index funds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>.
*   **20%** should be dedicated to testing new channels with the potential to be a "rocket ship" or the "next Nvidia," ensuring resilience if a primary channel falters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>.

### Strategic Decision-Making: Impact vs. Effort Matrix
CEOs must excel at decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>, using a "Shield versus Sword" or Impact versus Effort Matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a>. This involves:
1.  **Effort:** How much effort an initiative will require (ranked 1-5).
2.  **Impact:** The potential impact it will have on the business (ranked 1-5).
The goal is to prioritize "low-hanging fruit" ideas with high impact and low effort (e.g., a 5/5 impact for a 1/5 effort) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>. Founders should assess potential strategic acquisitions against their existing portfolio opportunities, as new shiny objects can be distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13:00">[28:13:00]</a>.

### Focus and Market Domination
It takes courage to focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[35:20:00]</a>. Markets typically reward the "gold medalist" or the best in a specific arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17:00">[36:17:00]</a>. Before entering a market or focusing, a founder should ask: "Can I be the best in this scenario?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:18:00">[36:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:00">[37:17:00]</a>. This involves identifying a unique qualification or niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:00">[37:17:00]</a>.

An example of hyper-niching and relentless focus is AppSumo's shift in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:19:00">[38:19:00]</a>. By analyzing customer data, they found that over 80% of their top customers were marketing agencies using software to reduce monthly spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:22:00">[38:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:25:00">[38:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:00">[38:43:00]</a>. By increasing software deals from one per quarter to one per day, they tripled their customer lifetime value, slashed customer acquisition costs, and saw all key performance indicators (KPIs) improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:04:00">[39:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:18:00">[39:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:56:00">[39:56:00]</a>.

## Founder to CEO Transition
Founders are artists who build, while CEOs are managers who scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:29:00">[47:29:00]</a>. The biggest mistake is abandoning a successful "flight" to start the next new thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a>. The founder's job is to discover revenue, not to hire someone to discover it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:47:00">[41:47:00]</a>.

### Identifying Your Zone of Genius
Your zone of genius is where you feel excited and spontaneously tinker, even before meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:43:00">[44:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:00">[44:51:00]</a>. It's about what motivates you when your calendar is empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:15:00">[45:15:00]</a>. This understanding helps in hiring executives that complement your strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:00:00">[43:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:10:00">[43:10:00]</a>.

The ultimate goal for a founder transitioning to CEO is to have nothing on their plate and think quarters or years ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:16:00">[46:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:36:00">[46:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:56:00">[47:56:00]</a>. If a business is at seven figures, the focus should remain on hitting monthly numbers rather than long-term visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:35:00">[48:35:00]</a>.

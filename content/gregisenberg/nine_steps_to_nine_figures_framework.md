The "Nine Steps to Nine Figures" is a framework designed to help businesses scale beyond seven figures, with the ultimate goal of reaching a $100 million valuation or exit within approximately five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This framework addresses the common misunderstanding among founders about what it takes to grow a business beyond initial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Overview of the Framework

The framework is divided into three distinct phases:
1.  **Startup** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
2.  **Scaleup** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
3.  **Growup** (Legacy Protection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>

Each phase requires a fundamental shift in how the company is run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## The Triple Triple Double Double Growth Strategy

A core component of achieving a $100 million business in five years is the [[triple_triple_double_double_business_growth_strategy | Triple Triple Double Double]] growth strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This strategy involves tripling revenue three times, then doubling it twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

**Example Pathway to $108 Million:**
*   Start with a $3 million business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Triple to $9 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Triple again to $27 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Triple a third time to $81 million (implied, the speaker adjusts to 27 to 54, and 54 to 108 based on previous statement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   Double to $54 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   Double again to $108 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>

This trajectory provides significant optionality for a $100 million exit or continued growth and market domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Phases of Business Growth

### Phase 1: Startup (Product-Market Fit)

The startup phase focuses on achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This involves three key steps:
1.  **Persona (Market)**: Deeply understanding who you are selling to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Every business should start with understanding its market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
2.  **Product**: Defining what you are selling to that market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
3.  **Promotion**: Determining how you will sell at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Product-market fit is achieved when a business has more leads than it knows what to do with, akin to "wearing a meat suit in a dog park" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This typically occurs around the mid-seven-figure revenue mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Phase 2: Scale-Up (Company Creation)

The scale-up phase shifts focus from being a product-led founder to building a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This phase centers on three critical elements:
1.  **Process**: Building a highly optimized and automated business, ideally software-driven and leveraging AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This comes *before* people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
2.  **People**: Hiring a handful of A-players rather than building a large, bureaucratic team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. For instance, the game GoldenEye was built with only 12 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
3.  **Performance**: Managing performance by providing teams with "scoreboards," incentives, and compensation packages, acting as a "world-class coach" drawing up the next play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

#### Incentive Structures

For executives like a COO, an ideal compensation structure is a 50/50 split of their bonus on top-line revenue and bottom-line profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This aligns the executive with the founder's goals of both growth and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

##### Equity vs. Cash Compensation

*   Harvard research suggests no significant increase in performance when employees receive equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   Many employees, especially those in their 30s and 40s who experienced venture-backed startups, prefer profit-sharing or bonus structures over equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   If offering equity, it should be framed as part of a total compensation package, allowing the employee to decide how much of their bonus is cash versus equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This ensures they understand the value and have "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Phase 3: Grow-Up (Legacy Protection)

This phase focuses on protecting the company's legacy and continuing growth after reaching significant scale (e.g., beyond $100 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

### The Importance of Foundation and Retention

Ignoring fundamental aspects like retention in the early stages is like "building a skyscraper on a sandy foundation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This can lead to churn issues and burnout for founders around the mid-seven-figure mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

*   **Focus on Loyalty, not Churn**: Instead of obsessing over "churn," focus on "loyalty," measured by net revenue retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. A 3% increase in net revenue retention can double a company's valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
*   **Net Revenue Retention**: This means a customer cohort spends more with you over time, rather than less due to churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. Examples include Slack and AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
*   **Retention First**: It's crucial to focus on retention upfront, even in the zero-to-one phase, before aggressively pursuing promotion or growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Growing a business with strong customer loyalty is significantly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

### Strategic Growth Channels

When considering growth tactics, a portfolio approach for marketing investments is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>:
*   **80% in "Index Funds"**: Allocate 80% of money, time, and energy to proven marketing channels that deliver consistent results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. This is your primary channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
*   **20% in "Rocket Ships"**: Allocate 20% to experimental channels with the potential for massive, rocket-ship growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. This diversification ensures resilience if a primary channel fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

### Acquisitions and Strategic Decisions

For big strategic decisions like acquisitions, use an **Impact vs. Effort Matrix** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Low Effort, High Impact**: Look for opportunities that require minimal effort but yield massive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
*   **Evaluate against existing opportunities**: Before pursuing external acquisitions, assess if there are "10 out of 10 ideas" within your existing business that offer a higher return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **Realistic Assessment**: A large acquisition (e.g., $50 million company) often involves significant effort (due diligence, integration, fixing underlying issues) and may not be as simple as it seems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.

## Founder vs. CEO

*   **Founder as Artist, CEO as Manager**: Founders are artists who build and discover, while CEOs are managers who scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The rare individual who can successfully transition from founder to great CEO reaps significant rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
*   **Handing off the Baton**: Once "flight" is discovered (product-market fit), the founder's job is to either become the right CEO for the next phase or hire a COO or president to execute the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
*   **CEO's Goal**: The ultimate goal for a founder transitioning to CEO is to have nothing on their plate, thinking quarters or years ahead in the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

### Identifying Your Zone of Genius

To identify your zone of genius, observe:
*   What on your calendar excites you? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>
*   What do you tinker with in the morning before meetings? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>
*   Where does your motivation gravitate when you have an empty calendar? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>

When hiring executives, it's better to hire in your zone of genius first. This allows you to identify what "genius" looks like and properly train and evaluate that individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.

### Focus vs. Multipreneurship

*   **Building Skyscrapers, Not Strip Malls**: Focus on expanding upon a successful business (building skyscrapers) rather than constantly creating new, disconnected business units (strip malls) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
*   **The "Gold Medalist" Mindset**: Only care about being the best in your chosen market, as the majority of value and rewards go to the market leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. Define your arena where you can be number one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.

### Hyper-Niching and Relentless Focus (AppSumo Example)

*   **Deeply Understand Your Persona**: Analyze customer data to identify top customers and their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. For AppSumo, their top customers were marketing agencies needing to reduce monthly software expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.
*   **Test Then Invest**: Conduct small experiments, and if successful, invest more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. AppSumo increased software deals from quarterly to daily based on positive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. This focus tripled their business by increasing customer loyalty, referrals, and negotiating power, while slashing acquisition costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
*   **Founder's Role in Discovery**: The founder's job is to "dig for oil" and discover new revenue opportunities through experiments, then hire to scale those discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. Allocate 20% of money, time, and energy to these experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.

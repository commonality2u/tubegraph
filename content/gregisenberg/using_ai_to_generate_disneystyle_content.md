This article explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can be leveraged to create incredible Disney-style content, from images to animated videos, and outlines various business opportunities stemming from these capabilities. Omar, a podcast listener and content creator, demonstrates how to use AI tools like Leonardo AI and Cling AI to produce Pixar-like imagery and narratives, emphasizing the potential for driving revenue through unique marketing and product offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Full Workflow with AI Avatars and Business Ideas
The discussion focuses on building full workflows using AI avatars and generating business ideas that can be started immediately with zero employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. By the end of the explained process, users should be able to assemble an [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI SAS product]] capable of generating cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Omar showcases how AI-generated content, such as custom AI Avatar videos, can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This process involves playing with various AI tools, which even children can engage with to create images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### The Shift in Business with AI
AI has contributed to a significant technical shift in product development, allowing products to be built instantly at low cost and with zero employees, eliminating the need for engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This contrasts with the traditional model of requiring large VC capital and years to launch a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Sequential Prompting: A New [[prompting_techniques_for_aigenerated_content | Prompting Technique]]
Omar introduces a third layer to [[prompting_techniques_for_aigenerated_content | AI prompting techniques]], called **sequential prompting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
This method involves:
1.  **Generating a prompt using ChatGPT**: ChatGPT is used to create a new prompt, often by analyzing an uploaded image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
2.  **Using the new prompt in another AI tool**: This generated prompt is then fed into a different AI tool (e.g., Leonardo AI) to create an output, such as an image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
3.  **Sequential processing**: The output from the second tool can then be used as input for subsequent AI tools (e.g., Cling AI for animation, Eleven Labs for voiceovers), building a sequence of creations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

This workflow can initially be done manually for iteration, but can later be automated using tools like Zapier or Make, or by connecting APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

### Demonstration: Creating an AI Avatar
The process begins with a specific prompt structure provided by Omar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
1.  **Input to ChatGPT**: Upload an image (e.g., of a child) to ChatGPT, specify their name, age, and gender, along with the prompt structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. ChatGPT reads the image and provides a detailed description as a prompt, including hairstyle, skin tone, and outfit, ensuring character consistency for storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
2.  **Image Generation with Leonardo AI**: The prompt generated by ChatGPT is then copied and pasted into Leonardo AI (leonardo.ai) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Leonardo AI quickly generates high-resolution, Disney-Pixar style images based on the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. The output can be customized (e.g., 16:9 widescreen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. This process can be automated by connecting ChatGPT's API to Leonardo AI's API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

Omar showcases an example of a "Teeny Tales" video, featuring an AI-generated character of Greg, which looks like it belongs in a Disney Pixar universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## Business Opportunities with Disney-Style AI Content

### 1. AI-First Personalized Greeting Cards and Stories
Leveraging the power of AI to create custom, animated content for personal use, such as birthday invites or gifts, offers a significant business opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. The concept involves creating an "AI-first" version of companies like Moonpig.com, which specializes in personalized greeting cards and generates substantial revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

A potential product could be a platform where users upload images, and the AI generates compelling stories with 3D characters, similar to the "Teeny Tales" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.
Features for such a product could include:
*   Dynamic character and scene creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.
*   AI-generated mini-stories for each card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.

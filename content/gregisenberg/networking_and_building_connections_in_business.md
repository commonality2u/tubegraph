Building strong business connections often involves direct, personal outreach. A key strategy for successful networking is to make yourself easily accessible and demonstrate flexibility, especially when reaching out to busy individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Strategies for Making Direct Connections

A highly effective method for initiating and developing business relationships is providing direct contact information and being open to informal communication methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>:
*   **Offer flexibility** A 23-year-old founder of a successful app studio, for example, offered his phone number and stated his schedule was "very flexible," inviting a text or call anytime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This approach is perceived as empathetic and smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Provide a direct phone number** Instead of formal scheduling, suggesting a simple text exchange can streamline the process and make it easier for busy people to connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Utilize text messaging** Some of the biggest corporate deals have been closed primarily through text messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This approach can be particularly effective with older, more traditional American corporate entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Direct Communication

Moving a conversation to text elevates the interaction, making it feel more personal and inviting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. It's akin to inviting someone into your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Once phone numbers are exchanged, it opens the door for more casual and continuous engagement, such as sharing relevant articles or insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This directness can be a powerful "hack" for building and maintaining connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

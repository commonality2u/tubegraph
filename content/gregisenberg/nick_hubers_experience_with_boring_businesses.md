Nick Huber, also known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," advocates for building wealth through "boring, sweaty businesses" over high-tech ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. He notes that many wealthy individuals he knows, who own private jets and beach houses, built their fortunes doing "something boring" such as underground utilities, surveying, HVAC, or real estate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. His philosophy suggests that [[starting_a_boring_business_for_success | increasing your odds of getting rich]] often involves doing something "normal" and "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Nick Huber's Business Journey

### Storage Squad: A Pickup and Delivery Storage Business
Huber's first significant venture was Storage Squad, a pickup and delivery storage business for college students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The service involved storing students' boxes in a warehouse during the summer and delivering them back when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Revenue and Profit**: At its peak, Storage Squad generated approximately $2.2 million in annual revenue, with about $400,000-$500,000 in annual profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Marketing Strategy**: The primary marketing method was "sidewalk chalk" ads, which Huber personally wrote over 5,000 times near student campuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Paid ads were only introduced in 2017 after revenue exceeded $2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping**: The business was bootstrapped using old cargo vans purchased from Craigslist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Origin and Profitability**: The idea for Storage Squad came when someone inquired about storing their items in Huber's apartment instead of leasing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The business was profitable from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Sale**: Huber sold the business in 2020 for $1.75 million with no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Transition to Self-Storage Facilities
Leveraging his experience, Huber ventured into self-storage facilities:
*   **Erie, Pennsylvania Facility**: In 2019, he purchased a 40,000+ sq ft facility with over 180 units in Erie, PA, for $625,000 at a public auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It was neglected and generating only about $4,000 per month in revenue, with over 100 abandoned units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **North Georgia Facility**: Later, Huber and his partner acquired another self-storage facility in North Georgia for $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This facility's monthly revenue grew from $15,600-$16,000 at purchase to $40,000 today, increasing its value to $4.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. He emphasizes that they achieved this without doing "anything spectacular," inventing anything, or raising money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Advantages of Boring Businesses
Huber suggests that many entrepreneurs gravitate towards tech startups, influenced by stories of Silicon Valley and figures like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. However, he argues that [[advantages_of_boring_businesses_over_tech_startups | boring businesses offer a clearer path to wealth]]:
*   **Lower Competition**: Unlike the crowded AI and tech startup space where founders compete against highly skilled individuals with significant venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>, "boring" local businesses often compete against less sophisticated operators who may not even answer their phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **Higher Odds of Success**: Huber uses the analogy of playing basketball against LeBron James versus a fifth-grade girl: while the reward for beating LeBron might be higher, the odds of winning against the less formidable opponent are far greater, even if the individual prize is smaller (e.g., $30,000 a month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
*   **Plain Sight Opportunities**: Many profitable "sweaty startups" exist in plain sight, requiring less innovation and more consistent execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Examples of Sweaty Startups and Unconventional Opportunities
Huber highlights several [[examples_of_successful_boring_businesses | types of businesses]] that represent [[sweaty_startups_and_unconventional_opportunities | unconventional opportunities]] and [[blue_collar_startups_and_local_service_businesses | local service businesses]]:
*   **Lawn Care**: His brother runs a lawn care company, making over $100,000 annually by primarily using "bandit signs" for marketing and working nine months a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Mobile Detailing**: A friend's mobile detailing business, "Detailed Dogs," generated $17,000 in revenue and $10,000 in profit in a single month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **High-End Transportation**: A friend operates a high-end airport transportation service with three other drivers, doing "really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Firewood Delivery with On-Site Racks**: A unique idea involves delivering seasoned firewood and building custom racks on-site for $800-$1,000 per delivery, potentially leading to $1,000 profit per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This could also evolve into a subscription service or a gateway to other services like lawn mowing or tree work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Local Bar TV Advertising**: An individual nets $20,000 a month by charging businesses $10 per month to display their ads on rotating TVs in 70 local bars and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Putting Green Installation**: A higher-skilled service that can earn $30,000 to $200,000 for high-end turf installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Tree Removal**: A lucrative but risky business, with two workers potentially earning over $3,000 for four hours of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Christmas Light Installation**: A seasonal business where clients pay $3,500-$4,000 for a few months of service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Power Washing**: A low-skill, low-money entry business for cleaning concrete, furniture, and decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Concrete Work**: Building driveways and patios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Bounce House Rentals**: Another "sweaty startup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## "Sweaty Digital Businesses" and Domain Investment
Huber and the host discussed the concept of "sweaty digital businesses," which blend the hands-on service approach with a digital platform.
*   **Night Nurses.com**: A proposed idea is a nanny recruiting company, specifically focusing on night nurses for new parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
    *   **Value Proposition**: Parents would pay $3,000-$5,000 for assistance with job posting, screening calls, background checks, and setting up interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
    *   **Marketplace Gap**: The host found a lack of a definitive marketplace for night nurses, unlike broader platforms like care.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
    *   **Domain Strategy**: The domain NightNurses.com was available for $13,000, which could be leased to own for $1,100 per month for 13 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. This price is considered a sound investment for digital real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
    *   **Initial Business Model**: Instead of immediately building a two-sided marketplace, the strategy would be to act as a recruiting service, charging a one-time fee to find and vet a night nurse for a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. This model aims for early profitability ($20,000/month by placing 20 nurses) before scaling or integrating more complex features like payroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.
    *   **Future Expansion**: This initial service could serve as an entry point to sell other products and services to new parents, or even integrate AI-powered payroll features later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Value of Premium Domains**: Huber emphasizes that spending on a premium domain like Somewhere.com (which he bought for $450,000) is a crucial investment, akin to investing in real estate or property facade improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. He believes that LLMs (Large Language Models) will prioritize `.com` domains in search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

## AI and Business Ownership
Huber expresses skepticism about the profitability of the large number of AI startups emerging in various niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. He predicts that while some will succeed, the vast majority (perhaps 99%) will not reach profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
*   **AI as a Tool**: He believes that AI will ultimately serve as a tool that enables existing business owners to make more money, rather than being the primary source of profit for new AI companies themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.
*   **Analogy**: He uses the invention of the lawnmower as an analogy: it didn't eliminate lawn care companies; instead, it became a tool that made them more efficient and profitable, even as demand for professional lawn services increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

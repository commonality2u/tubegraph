Community building through organized group forums is a powerful method for fostering deep connections, personal growth, and professional development among individuals sharing common experiences, such as entrepreneurship or overcoming personal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. These structured gatherings provide a confidential space for sharing and support, leading to profound friendships and valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>.

## The EO/YPO Forum Model

Entrepreneur Andrew Wilkinson shared his personal experience with the Entrepreneurs' Organization (EO) and Young Presidents' Organization (YPO) forums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. Initially skeptical about joining a group of older entrepreneurs from different industries, he was advised to focus on the "forum" aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.

> "I walk into the room and it's all these 40 to 50-year-old dudes who have like blue collar businesses or they're like investment managers or like you know they guys that wear suits like business people and I was immediately allergic to that because I was like you know a 20-year-old in a hoodie who's in TCT and none of these people were in TCH and my immediate thought was like well what can I learn from these guys like this is like so pointless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>

The forum structure involves a monthly meeting where five or six entrepreneurs gather to share everything going on in their lives, including personal, family, and business matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. This consistent ritual of deep, personal sharing builds immense trust, largely due to the key rule that "nothing leaves the room" and everything is confidential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.

Over time, these forums evolve into strong "bonded Band of Brothers" as members navigate life's challenges, such as divorces, co-founder issues, payroll difficulties, or difficult employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>. The shared language of business helps participants bond and find common ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.

## Broader Applications of Group Forums

The success of EO/YPO forums suggests a broader opportunity to [[creating_content_to_build_a_community | create more of these sorts of groups]] beyond traditional business contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>.

### Comparison to AA Meetings
The structure and benefits of entrepreneurial forums are comparable to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. AA meetings involve a ritual where participants stand up, share crazy stories, and experience a sense of connectedness, friendship, and bonding in a confidential environment, similar to "church or something like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.

### Informal Groups and Secular Churches
Beyond formal organizations, opportunities exist to facilitate deeper connections through interest-based groups or those focused purely on friendship or group therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Dinner parties and book groups:** While common, these are often less deep than the forum model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.
*   **"Secular church":** This concept involves a weekly event with a group of people and their families to build a sense of community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.
*   **"Man Mornings":** A group in Los Angeles that started with men getting together for coffee and walks in the mornings, fostering deep conversations and bonding, leading to strong friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. The success of this initiative highlights a desire for people to share and connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

In an increasingly online world with declining church attendance, people are actively seeking this sense of community, presenting a significant opportunity for individuals or businesses to create such groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>.

## The "Friend Billionaire" Concept

The pursuit of deep friendships and community can be more rewarding than material wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. Instead of aiming to be a financial billionaire, focusing on becoming a "friend billionaire"—someone with a vibrant life, constantly meeting new people, and possessing deep friendships—is presented as a more desirable goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.

## Networking and Opportunity Surface Area

Organized groups, even those not primarily focused on profit, can significantly increase one's "opportunity surface area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. This means that by building a broad and interesting group of friends with high trust, unexpected opportunities can arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>. For example, a future business's investors, earliest employees, or co-founders could emerge from such a group, illustrating how [[leveraging_groups_and_communities_for_leads | cultivating strong communities]] can lead to unforeseen benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>. This is likened to the value of attending prestigious universities like Harvard, where the primary benefit often comes from the network of influential individuals one meets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.

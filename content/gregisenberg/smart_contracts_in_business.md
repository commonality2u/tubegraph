Smart contracts are a developing technology that can bring transparency and fairness to business agreements by removing the need for third-party trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:54">[09:55:54]</a>. This technology is expected to become increasingly significant in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:59">[02:14:59]</a>.

## How Smart Contracts Work

The concept behind smart contracts is that if predefined conditions are met, funds held in escrow are automatically released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:33">[09:42:33]</a>. Conversely, if conditions are not met by a specified time, the funds are returned to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:52">[09:50:52]</a>. This mechanism aims to make transactions very transparent and fair, reducing anxiety for both parties involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:54">[09:55:54]</a>. The principle of not needing to trust a third party is what makes this aspect of crypto, particularly [[defi_works_so_well | DeFi]], interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:07">[10:21:07]</a>.

## Business Applications

### Pay-for-Performance Agencies

Smart contracts are seen as a natural fit for pay-for-performance models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:59">[02:14:59]</a>. In a scenario where an agency charges based on results (e.g., increased conversion rates), smart contracts could automatically distribute agreed-upon percentages of the generated profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:68">[09:03:68]</a>. This eliminates disputes over performance metrics and payment, ensuring the best marketers capture even more value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:03">[02:18:03]</a>.

### Service Providers and Agencies

For service providers, smart contracts can mitigate the risk of non-payment from clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:96">[11:13:96]</a>. If an agency completes its work and delivers, and the money is held in an escrow account via a smart contract, it would automatically be transferred to the agency's account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:19">[10:54:19]</a>. This prevents situations where clients face financial difficulties or stiff the agency, which can otherwise lead to lengthy and ineffective legal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:07">[11:05:07]</a>.

### Gamification and Incentives

Beyond external client relationships, smart contracts can be used for internal business gamification, such as employee incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:08">[11:43:08]</a>. For instance, a tool like "incentive.xyz" could link employee engagement and task completion (trackable via APIs) to small rewards in cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:19">[12:00:19]</a>. This creates a leaderboard and can significantly increase engagement in internal tools, serving as a basis for promotions or performance management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:40">[12:21:40]</a>.

### Potential Role in an [[AI world | AI World]]

In an [[AI world | AI and data world]], marketers have access to more data, enabling them to better "underwrite" opportunities and take calculated risks on performance-based models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>. This improved data-driven decision-making could further enhance the effectiveness and adoption of smart contracts in business.

The current era is described as the "Golden Age" of [[SEO strategies for AI startups | AI and SEO]] combined, offering a significant window of opportunity for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This period is compared to the early days of the Apple iOS App Store, where simple applications like flashlight or calculator apps could generate income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, this opportunity is time-sensitive, with predictions that many niches will be filled within two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Being first to market, building backlinks, and securing domain names are crucial for maintaining a top position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Identifying Opportunities with AI and SEO

A key strategy involves identifying low-competition, high search intent keywords to rank quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Tools like Ahrefs.com can be used to type in keywords and find areas with high search intent and low keyword difficulty, indicated by a score between 0 and 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. A score of 0 suggests no competition, making it possible to create a website and rank rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Historically, the challenge with ranking for easy keywords was the time required to create content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. For instance, a website like Lingfolio.com, a website inspiration gallery, could rank quickly but demanded significant content creation effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. With AI, content can now be generated rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Case Study: AI Tattoos

An example of this strategy is the "AI Tattoos" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. By using Ahrefs and typing in "tattoos," thousands of long-tail keywords like "butterfly tattoo" or "dragon tattoo" can be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. AI tools such as Stable Diffusion or Midjourney can then be used to generate content for these keywords, automatically building directories of examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

This approach allows for organic website growth and can integrate user-generated content using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Within a month, hundreds of thousands of content pieces can be generated, which Google tends to favor, leading to increased traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The AI Tattoos project, for example, achieved a Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) of $10,000 before being sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This method is applicable to "anything AI-related combined with low keyword difficulty content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Urgency in the AI and SEO Space

The window for exploiting these niches is closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The market is becoming increasingly competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. In the AI headshot generation market, for instance, initial competitors quickly grew from three or four to thousands due to AI boilerplates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. While some top companies can still compete in a busy market, speed is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Entering the AI space a year late is likely "too late" for many tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. The "Gold Rush" of finding unutilized keywords with 0-5 keyword difficulty will be over within two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## New Business Ideas Leveraging AI

### ComfyUI Marketplace

ComfyUI is a user-friendly interface that allows for visual pipeline building with drag-and-drop nodes, making complex machine learning tasks easier than traditional Python coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. There's a growing trend of YouTubers creating tutorials for ComfyUI workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

An opportunity exists to create a ComfyUI marketplace where users can sell or rent out these workflow templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This is a low-risk, high-impact idea that a small team could execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The increase in YouTube tutorials and the rapid growth of the ComfyUI subreddit (now a top 3-4% subreddit) indicate significant interest and potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This trend mirrors the success of Notion template creators who leverage YouTube to generate millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Fiverr/Upwork 2.0 (AI-Powered Service Marketplaces)

The existing freelance platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, where people hire freelancers for jobs, are being impacted by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Many traditional tasks on these platforms are now automatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

The concept for "Fiverr/Upwork 2.0" is a platform where users "hire" AI models, bots, and workflows instead of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The platform would make it feel like a human is being hired, abstracting away the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. For example, instead of hiring a translator for an Excel sheet, a user would drop the Excel sheet, and an AI would translate it within a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This caters to "normies" who might be hesitant to directly use AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

This model is particularly attractive to bigger companies seeking automations and reliable outputs without manual oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. It leverages the fact that many tasks on current platforms are low-level and repetitive, making them prime candidates for AI automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Upwork's stock has declined due to decreased revenue and fears that generative AI will eliminate freelance jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. This creates an acquisition opportunity for a successful AI-powered marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.

To acquire customers, one could leverage existing platforms like Upwork, applying for popular jobs and fulfilling them using the AI-powered service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. This mimics how Airbnb initially seeded its platform by posting fake listings on Craigslist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

### Humanizing AI for Broader Adoption

For AI products to be widely adopted, they need to feel familiar and intuitive, like a real-world interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. This "humanized AI" approach means not focusing on the AI aspect but rather on the service it replaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.

For example, Headshot Pro, an AI headshot generation service, doesn't emphasize AI but instead focuses on replacing the traditional physical photo shoot experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. Users take 15 selfies from home, and AI acts as the photographer, delivering photos in two hours, mirroring the traditional process without human involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

This concept can be applied to other services:

*   **Medical Scribes:** Doctors often use human scribes to take notes during patient encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. This role can be automated using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. AI (e.g., OpenAI Whisper for transcription, an LLM for summarization) can transcribe conversations and summarize notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. A product like "Autoscribe" does this, allowing doctors to see 10-20% more patients daily and ensuring critical information is captured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   **Veterinary Scribes:** Similarly, an AI note-taking app specifically for veterinarians can address a niche market with little competition, providing tailored solutions they prefer over general consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.
*   **Productized Marketing Agency:** Building on the idea of [[building_automated_businesses_with_ai | building automated businesses with AI]], a marketing agency could run entirely on AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. For instance, a service like "Headline 99" could automatically generate landing page headlines for $99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. Customers fill out a questionnaire, LLMs generate headline ideas, and a human picks the best options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>. This [[applications_of_ai_in_ecommerce_and_content_creation | productizes a service]], offering an extra layer of ease for users who may not be comfortable directly using AI software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. Such an agency could scale to high revenue with minimal human involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>.

Identifying these opportunities involves understanding the repetitive, disliked workflows of various practitioners (dentists, auto mechanics, barbers) and replacing them with AI, offering a significant competitive advantage due to the boring or niche nature of the problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

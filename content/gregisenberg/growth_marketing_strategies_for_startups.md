David Park, the founder of Jenny AI, successfully grew his [[aibased_startup_ideas_and_growth_strategies | AI startup]] from zero to $10 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in just a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His comprehensive playbook, shared in this episode, covers various [[modern_marketing_strategies | modern marketing strategies]], including paid ads, SEO, and [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_software_companies | influencer marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Core Growth Playbook

Park's strategy focuses on a multi-pronged approach, prioritizing channels that offer quick feedback loops for early-stage startups.

### Organic Short-Form Content

One of the most effective [[growth_strategies_using_creators_and_social_media | growth strategies using creators and social media]] for Jenny AI has been organic short-form content, particularly through platforms like TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

#### Fresh Accounts vs. Established Accounts
Contrary to popular belief, follower count on social media is not the primary driver of content virality today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. A fresh account with few followers can go viral with a single compelling video, especially if the hook is good and the content is high-quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. David Park notes that his company, Jenny AI, has observed "fresh accounts" outperforming established accounts with 70,000 followers in terms of engagement and views, even with identical content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This means sponsoring a new account that's trending could be more beneficial and significantly cheaper than a large YouTuber, who might charge tens of thousands for a short mention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

#### Creating Your Own Accounts
Instead of solely relying on sponsoring external creators, companies can create their own fresh accounts and position a creator as the "face" of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This allows direct control over content and messaging, educating viewers about pain points the product solves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

#### Case Study: Ming May Duck and Jenny AI
Jenny AI partnered with Ming May Duck, who had approximately 300,000 followers on TikTok at the time, to create a new account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. David Park paid him $4,000 per month for 20 videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The new account started from zero followers and grew to 70,000 followers, accumulating half a billion views across platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. In the first month alone, they garnered 7 million impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. A single viral video can add thousands in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

#### Crafting a Viral Video Series
The goal is to find a "viral series" â€“ a format that, once successful, can be replicated repeatedly with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. People are creatures of habit and prefer content that provides "creature comforts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. An example is the "POV: You have a paper or an essay due" series created for Jenny AI, which consistently went viral, generating over 300 million views and half a million dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

#### The Order of Virality Playbook
1.  **Farm Multiple Accounts:** Instead of one account per platform, create several to maximize surface area for luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
2.  **Experiment Heavily:** Test numerous hooks and video ideas, as well as different creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Daily posting is crucial for rapid testing and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
3.  **Identify Viral Content:** Once a video goes viral, analyze its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
4.  **Turn into a Series:** Tweak the viral video into a repeatable series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
5.  **Replicate Across Accounts:** Post the series on all active accounts and platforms (Reels, TikTok, Shorts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
6.  **Translate for New Audiences:** Create the same viral content with creators who speak other languages to reach new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
7.  **Sponsor Reposts:** At the tail end of a content cycle, pay meme pages or other accounts with high reach to repost your viral videos for a "second life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
8.  **Leverage for Paid Ads:** Use mega-viral content for paid advertising campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
9.  **Return to Step One:** When content becomes played out or competitors copy it, return to experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

#### Format-Product Fit
Going viral for its own sake is "empty calories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. It is critical that the viral content organically fits your product. For example, a viral series about doing homework quickly for an AI writing tool makes sense, but the same series for a milk company would not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. A video that garnered 20 million views for Jenny AI had a negligible effect on conversions because it lacked product relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

#### Finding Influencers
1.  **Talk to Users:** Ask your target users which influencers they follow in your product's niche. This provides unbiased insights into who truly influences them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
2.  **Use Social Media Algorithms:** Create a new Instagram or TikTok account, manually follow a list of relevant influencers, and watch their videos to completion. The algorithm will then suggest similar accounts, acting as a free influencer discovery tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. This method helps discover "crazy deals" with emerging creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

#### Reaching Out to Influencers
*   **Multi-Channel Outreach:** Use all available avenues: DMs, emails, LinkedIn, or even obscure platforms like old Tumblr blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. The effort to find less common contact methods can impress the influencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>.
*   **Personalized and Concise:** Messages should be detailed and tailored, demonstrating genuine fandom for their content, but remain concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. Avoid jargon about funding rounds or employee numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.
*   **Indicate Paid Promotion:** Clearly state that it is a paid promotion to stand out from offers of free products or subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **Expect Low Response Rates:** Most messages will not receive a response, especially early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. As your product gains recognition, outreach becomes easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.
*   **"Venmo Hack":** A creative hack to grab attention is to send a small payment (e.g., $50) via Venmo with a message, as push notifications almost guarantee a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

#### Negotiating with Influencers
*   **Align Incentives:** Structure deals to ensure both parties want a high-converting video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
*   **Split Payments:** Avoid paying all money upfront. Include a percentage based on conversions (e.g., using a personal coupon code) or views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
*   **Transparency:** Be transparent about your budget and target ROI, and expect them to be transparent about their demographics and past sponsored video performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.
*   **Negotiate Down from the Top:** Start by inquiring about the most expensive package (e.g., full usage rights, link in bio, cross-platform posting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. Then, remove features you don't need to find the true, non-inflated price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. Finally, suggest bulk deals (e.g., three videos a month) with a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **Don't Pay Based on Follower Count:** David Park warns against paying influencers based on follower count, calling it "craziest misinformation" that leads to poor ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Focus on actual views and engagement potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.

#### Posting Content
*   **Tailor to Influencer's Style:** Content must align with the influencer's existing style to ensure good retention and engagement with their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   **Trust the Influencer:** If inexperienced, trust the influencer to integrate your product seamlessly into their established content series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
*   **Scale and Autopilot:** The goal is to scale to a point where a video about your product is posted every few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. This requires trusting influencers with a clear blueprint and minimal micromanagement, allowing them to "cook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.
*   **Don't Fear Direct Ads:** Even if a video looks like a "straightup ad," it can convert better, as it clearly addresses a pain point and offers a solution, resonating with those who genuinely need the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.

### SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

SEO is described as a "delayed gratification" channel, taking a long time to generate significant traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

*   **Timing:** Startups should not prioritize SEO on day one. It's more suitable when you have a steady income stream and Product-Market Fit (PMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. Other channels like influencer marketing provide faster traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.
*   **Acquire Expertise:** Jenny AI acquired an entire SEO agency to make them their in-house team, ensuring dedicated expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.
*   **Featured Snippets:** Target featured snippets on Google by creating the "perfect answer" to specific queries, allowing you to "leapfrog" search rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.
*   **Increase Brand Name Searches:** Influencer marketing and UGC passively boost your brand's legitimacy with Google, as people search for your product directly after seeing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.
*   **Focus on Conversion-Oriented Keywords:** Prioritize keywords that indicate buying intent, rather than vanity metrics or "free" searches, to ensure traffic leads to conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.
*   **Tactics:** Strategies include creating mini-tools, free tools, landing pages in different languages, and extensive content writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.

### Paid Ads

Paid ads are also considered a "trap" for early-stage entrepreneurs due to longer iteration cycles and the need for significant learning phases and creative development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>.

*   **Timing:** Like SEO, paid ads are best pursued after achieving some Product-Market Fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>.
*   **Leverage Organic Data:** Successful organic content can be repurposed for paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>. Data from social media partnerships can inform better targeting from day one, such as identifying countries with higher conversion rates and Lifetime Value (LTV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.
*   **Metrics:** Aim for a 3:1 LTV to Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and a short payback period (e.g., recouping costs within two months), allowing for reinvestment into top-performing acquisition channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>.

## [[scaling_startups_from_zero_to_10_million_revenue | Scaling Startups from Zero to 10 Million Revenue]]

Reaching $10 million ARR from $5 million for Jenny AI involved continuing existing strategies while refining operations and focusing on fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

*   **Operational Scaling:** Improvements in hiring and building out teams were crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Marketing:** A significant portion of new revenue comes from affiliate marketers who champion Jenny AI and earn a cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   **Acquisitions:** Jenny AI strategically acquired other startups, leveraging their existing growth learnings to double the revenue of acquired companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. This acts as a hedge and a way to apply proven growth models to new ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>.
*   **Focus on Retention & Conversion:** Despite high traffic, a strong focus on the user funnel, including retention and conversion rates, proved vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>. Jenny AI impressively reduced its monthly churn from 20% to around 9.8%, significantly impacting overall growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. This focus on "getting back to the basics" and refining the funnel is crucial as a startup scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.

## Final Tips for Aspiring Founders

David Park emphasizes that building a successful startup requires a blend of managerial skills and creative intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. It's about efficiently managing campaigns, tracking data, and identifying winning and losing strategies, while also building genuine human relationships with creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. He encourages founders to leverage any personal advantage they can, such as common ground with potential partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>. His experience as a non-technical, college dropout founder of an [[aibased_startup_ideas_and_growth_strategies | AI startup]] demonstrates that significant achievements are possible with dedication and persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>.

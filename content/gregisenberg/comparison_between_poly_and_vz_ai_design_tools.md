This article provides a [[comparing_ai_tools_and_their_functionalities | comparison of AI design tools]], specifically focusing on Poly and VZ, based on a first-hand user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Both tools claim to help users, including non-designers, create production-ready designs and front-end code using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

## Poly AI Designer Tool
Poly is an [[ai_product_designers | AI product designer]] Y Combinator startup that allows users to generate "beautiful designs" and "production-ready code" by simply writing in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The user tried Poly for the first time on camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Initial Impressions & Features
*   **Interface**: Poly's interface is described as being "almost like Chat GPT but for design," allowing users to write what they want to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Input Methods**: It supports text input and voice recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>, and notably, the ability to upload an image or even a wireframe drawn on a napkin to guide the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Cost Model**: Poly uses a credit-based system, with 250 free credits upon signup. Generating a page costs 50 credits, and a component costs 25 credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.
*   **Editor**: It allows editing of elements like font, radius, and colors after generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Designs are saved and accessible on the right-hand side of the interface, with a rollback button available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>.
*   **Processing Time**: Generation can take a "couple minutes," with no visible progress bar, which can be frustrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

### Design Experiment with Poly
The user tested Poly by attempting to design a SaaS product for YouTube analytics and engagement prediction, inspired by a viral tweet concept for Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. The desired aesthetic was "glassy, minimalist, and with colorful calls to action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

#### First Attempt
*   **Prompt**: A detailed description of a YouTube analytics SaaS, including the desired aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. An image of the inspirational tweet was also attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **Result**: Poly generated a landing page named "C2Predict" with copy like "AI powered analytics to optimize your YouTube content and maximize your engagement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
*   **Critique**:
    *   The design did not appear "glassy" as requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.
    *   Clicking "Get Started" or "Analytics" on the generated page resulted in a black screen, indicating it was only a landing page, not a functional product demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. The user expressed disappointment that it didn't create actual product images or clickable demos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.
    *   The visual appeal was deemed "fine" but not as interesting as hoped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.

#### Second Attempt
*   **Refined Prompt**: The user learned the correct design term "glassmorphism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>. The prompt was revised to specifically ask for "glassmorphism" and criticized the previous output for irrelevant product images resembling website analytics dashboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>. The original image was re-attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>.
*   **Result**: The second attempt produced a more functional-looking product interface with sections for "Version A," "Image/Video Format," and "Emoji" (though "Emoji" was irrelevant for YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45:00">[23:45:00]</a>. It included "cumulative engagement chart," "statistical confidence," "recent optimizations," and "AI suggestions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.
*   **Critique**:
    *   The design was "beautiful" and "pretty cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>, providing more depth than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:00">[24:22:00]</a>.
    *   While better, it still wasn't "super glassy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>, but was starting to look "pretty good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.
    *   A notable pro was the ability to hover over charts to see specific data points, a feature missing in the competitor tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>.

## VZ AI Design Tool
VZ, likely Vercel's v0, is described as "the most well-known product in the [[ai_product_designers | AI designer]] space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. The user has prior experience with VZ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

### Design Experiment with VZ
The same YouTube analytics SaaS design prompt was given to VZ for [[comparison_of_ai_coding_tools | comparison]].

*   **Prompt**: The same prompt used for Poly, including the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a>.
*   **Process**: VZ provides "reasoning" about what it's doing during the generation process, which makes the user "feel more at ease" and like they're "actually talking to someone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>.
*   **Result**: VZ produced a design that was "incredibly similar" to the Poly output in terms of layout but "literally just copied the image" provided, which the user found "horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:23:00">[22:23:00]</a>. However, it did "actually build the product" with elements like "version A," "original content title, description, thumbnail," and predicted performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>.
*   **Critique**:
    *   The design was considered "amazing" and something the user "would totally use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>.
    *   It provided interactive elements, though it lacked the hover functionality seen in Poly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>.
    *   When asked if it was "glassmorphic," VZ acknowledged that its current design only had "some glass-like elements" and offered to "enhance it to create distinctive frosted glass aesthetic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>. This conversational feedback was preferred over Poly's "shouting into a dark hole" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:00">[25:16:00]</a>.
    *   The visual design was deemed "a little bit nicer" than Poly's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_ai_coding_tools | Comparison of AI Coding Tools]] & Design Functionalities
### General Observations
*   **Prompting Skills**: To get the most out of these [[ai_product_designers | AI product designers]], users need to understand design terms and trends. The tools are "as good as the prompt that you can do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.
*   **User Expectations**: The bar for AI product outputs is "so high" that the results need to be "incredible" for users to integrate them into their workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.
*   **Ideal AI Designer**: An ideal [[ai_product_designers | AI product designer]] would ask clarifying questions about desired "vibe" or "taste" to translate user intent into design, or simply know current design trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>.

### Conclusion on [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | Using AI Tools for Product Design]]
The current recommendation leans slightly towards VZ due to its better feedback mechanism and slightly nicer visual design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>. However, the landscape of [[ai_product_designers | AI product designers]] is rapidly changing, and a tool that is better today might be surpassed tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>.

The most effective strategy for [[choosing_the_right_ai_tool_based_on_user_skill_level | choosing the right AI tool based on user skill level]] and getting the best results from [[ai_product_designers | AI product designers]] is to use "a couple tools" in conjunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:32:00">[28:32:00]</a>. Just as users might use Chat GPT, Claude, or Grok for writing or research, having three or four tools for [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | AI product design]] will become common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:00">[28:46:00]</a>. It's about finding the "nuances that make these products better" and leveraging each tool's strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17:00">[29:17:00]</a>.

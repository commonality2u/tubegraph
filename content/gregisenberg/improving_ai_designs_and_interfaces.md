Achieving significant improvements in AI-generated content, such as better results, copy, and overall output, can be done by leveraging competition between different large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Grock, Claude, and Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This method, which requires no financial cost, involves making LLMs "jealous" of each other to elicit superior responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Strategy: Pitting LLMs Against Each Other

Traditionally, users might interact with a single LLM for a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. However, a more effective strategy involves opening multiple LLMs simultaneously—two, three, or four at a time—and deliberately creating a competitive environment between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This approach directly facilitates [[enhancing_ai_effectiveness_through_competition | enhancing AI effectiveness through competition]].

### Practical Application

To apply this strategy, follow these steps:
1.  **Initial Prompting**: Provide the same prompt to each LLM. For instance, to create a cold email for a design firm like LCA, which specializes in [[designing_with_ai_prompt_clarity | designing AI]] interfaces, ask each model to generate an email that stands out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
2.  **Evaluate Initial Responses**: Review the outputs from each LLM.
    *   **Grock's Example**: An initial response from Grock for a cold email about [[developing_a_user_interface_using_ai_tools | AI interfaces]] highlighted the issue of users abandoning platforms due to "clunky, outdated designs." It proposed crafting interfaces that "don't just function, but captivate," focusing on "intuitive" and "native design" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This demonstrates how [[utilizing_ai_tools_for_modern_product_design | utilizing AI tools for modern product design]] can address user retention.
    *   **ChatGPT's Example**: ChatGPT's initial attempt offered a subject line: "Your AI deserves better design." It positioned the firm as one that designs "interfaces that make people trust your AI" and noted that current UIs might feel "more proof of concept than product people will pay for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
3.  **Introduce Competition**: After receiving the initial responses, critique one LLM's output by unfavorably comparing it to another's. For example, tell ChatGPT that Grock "crushed it and was a nine on 10," while ChatGPT itself was "kind of average and was five on 10," implying you thought ChatGPT was the better LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. You can even share the competitor's output as "FYI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
4.  **Observe Improved Output**: The LLM, now "competing," will often produce a significantly better response.
    *   **ChatGPT's Improved Response**: After being prompted to compete, ChatGPT refined its email, aiming for a "fresher" and "harder-punching" tone that sounded like an agency "people brag about hiring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. It emphasized that many [[embedding_ai_to_enhance_app_functionality | AI tools]] lose users because the interface feels like a "science project," lacking emotion and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. The revised version highlighted specializing in interfaces that feel like "conversations, not commands," earning trust on first use, and increasing activation and retention, not just aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
5.  **Continue the Cycle**: Repeat this process, pitting LLMs against each other (e.g., telling Claude that ChatGPT's response was "10x better" and sharing the improved output) to continue refining the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

This method allows users to extract superior outputs from LLMs, ultimately leading to more sophisticated and user-centric AI designs and interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

The future of marketing is predicted to include direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands owning and developing their own digital influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>. This concept arose from observations of real-world incidents, such as a celebrity spokesperson for Coach getting into public trouble, making her "bad goods" for the brand despite a multi-year deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:00]</a>. This highlights the risk associated with human influencers.

## Why Brands will Own Digital Influencers

There are several compelling reasons for brands to transition to owning [[future_of_marketing_with_ai_agents | digital influencers]]:

*   **Cost-Effectiveness** It will be significantly cheaper than hiring human celebrities or influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>.
*   **Risk Mitigation** Digital influencers eliminate the risk of public scandal or misbehavior that can damage a brand's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. They are always "on-brand" and perform as promised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>.
*   **Consistency** Unlike human creators whose interests may change, digital influencers offer consistent representation of a brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>. This also makes the process of finding the right "influencer" less difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:00">[22:43:00]</a>.
*   **Asset Ownership** Digital influencers become an owned digital asset, similar to a YouTube channel or email list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. They represent a form of [[embeddable_businesses_and_digital_real_estate | digital real estate]] that can be included on a balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term Stability** A digital spokesperson could potentially represent a company for hundreds of years, never aging and remaining free from scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:10:00">[33:10:00]</a>.

## Creation and Strategy

### Developing Digital Influencers
The process of creating digital influencers leverages [[innovative_ai_media_formats | AI-powered tools]]:

*   **Generation** Tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Focus can generate photo-realistic 3D renders of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:49:00">[29:49:00]</a>.
*   **Consistency** Features like "face lock" help maintain a consistent appearance across multiple generations and poses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>. AI-powered editing tools like Mock Moi and Canva can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:55:00">[27:55:00]</a>. Initially, face-swapping technology on models with similar body types was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:00">[28:08:00]</a>.
*   **Training** Brands can train AI models on a specific person's likeness to create a digital version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:00">[23:39:00]</a>.
*   **Multimodal Content** As technology advances, these influencers will create short-form videos (e.g., GIFs, TikToks), long-form YouTube videos, and content for Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>.

### Crafting Narratives and Engagement
Brands can create intricate narratives and "lore" around these digital characters, similar to fantasy worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>. This can involve creating drama and gossip among multiple digital influencers to generate conversation and deeper engagement with the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>. This entertainment aspect is expected to drive audience engagement, much like how people connect with fictional characters in movies or TV shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44:00">[29:44:00]</a>.

## Market Evolution

Initially, agencies will offer [[influencer_marketing_as_a_service | digital influencer creation as a service]] to companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>. Over time, large corporations are expected to build internal teams dedicated to developing and managing networks of these digital influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>.

The transition from human to digital influencers is seen as an inevitability due to cost-effectiveness and reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>. This will transform how brands engage in [[influencer_marketing_tactics_on_tiktok | influencer marketing]].

### Real-World Precedents

Early examples of digital influencers already exist:

*   **Lil Miquela:** One of the earliest digital influencers, initially appearing as flat images and later evolving into super realistic short-form videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>.
*   **Aitana Lopez:** A Barcelona-based AI model created by an art collective. She gained viral attention, even selling content on OnlyFans, demonstrating the potential for monetization and audience engagement with non-human entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:00">[31:16:00]</a>.

### Human Connection to Digital Avatars

Despite skepticism, people readily connect with fictional characters in media, such as those in "Avatar" or "Family Guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:48:00">[30:48:00]</a>. As technology improves, users may not even distinguish between human and digital creators when scrolling social media feeds like Instagram, YouTube Shorts, or TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>. The entertainment value is a key driver of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44:00">[29:44:00]</a>.

This shift also reflects the growing trend of younger generations aspiring to be YouTubers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>. Companies could hire these individuals on salary to create consistent content, treating them as in-house brand representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">[30:00:00]</a>.

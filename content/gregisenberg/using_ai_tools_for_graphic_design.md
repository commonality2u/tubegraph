[[Using AI tools for graphic design]]

Brett, a designer from Designjoy, leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to produce high-quality, aesthetically pleasing designs, earning millions of dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. He highlights that achieving beautifully generated graphics is a surprisingly simple process, emphasizing that there's no hidden "magic" behind the scenes, just powerful tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Accessibility for Non-Designers
The tools and content shared are not exclusively for designers, but rather for anyone with access to subscriptions like Midjourney or ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. No prior design knowledge is required to use these tools effectively; while having "good taste" helps, there's no skill barrier for non-creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Key AI Tools for Graphic Design
The realm of generative AI includes various forms like image and video generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Several tools are available, each serving different purposes:

### Higgsfield
Higgsfield is presented as an easy entry point for those new to AI creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. It offers pre-set templates, actions, and effects, simplifying the process of telling the AI what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Users can upload a product image, select a preset, and generate a video, as demonstrated with a Liquid Death can example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The tool can intelligently incorporate product branding and even maintain text on items, a feature that was previously a challenge for AI generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. It's particularly effective for quickly creating [[using_ai_for_ad_creation | ads]] for platforms like Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Midjourney
Midjourney is primarily used for generating high-quality images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. It excels at applying artistic styling and serves as a foundational step for video creation by providing initial reference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. While many AI tools exist (e.g., Cling, Korea, Visual Electric, Flora), Midjourney is one of the top tools Brett recommends sticking with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### ChatGPT
ChatGPT is crucial for crafting specific and detailed prompts for image and video generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Previously, prompting required author-level descriptive skills, but ChatGPT now automates this, making prompting accessible to anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Users can provide a simple idea, and ChatGPT will expand upon it, creating sophisticated prompts for tools like Midjourney or Runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This allows for the generation of consistent collections of images based on a single initial concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

### Runway
Runway is a prominent tool for adding motion to static images and creating videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Users upload an image and input a prompt (often generated by ChatGPT) describing the desired movement, such as "soft ripples in the water" or "trees blowing softly in the wind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Runway typically generates videos that are 5 to 10 seconds long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. It also allows for upscaling videos to 4K quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

### Cling
Cling is another image-to-video tool that features "start and end frame" capabilities, enabling seamless looping of videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. After video generation, it can also add AI-generated sound options that align with the video's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

### Magnific Upscaler
This tool is used to enhance images with "super rich details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### Traditional Tools
While AI handles much of the generation, traditional tools like Photoshop and CapCut still play a role. Photoshop can be used for generative fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. CapCut, a user-friendly video editing platform, is ideal for adding text layers or stitching together multiple video clips for longer, continuous shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

## Workflow Integration
A typical workflow involves using ChatGPT to generate detailed prompts, then feeding those prompts into Midjourney to create artistic images. These images can then be taken into Runway to add motion and create videos. For longer videos, the last frame of one video can be saved and used as the starting point for the next, creating a continuous shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Traditional editing tools like CapCut can then stitch these segments together and add elements like text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. Pinterest is also a valuable resource for finding stylistic directions and reference images to upload as style references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Opportunities in AI Design
The biggest opportunity for creatives and startups using AI today lies in [[creating_art_and_branding_with_ai | branding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. AI allows for the rapid generation of consistent and cohesive visual assets for a brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. While AI is not yet proficient in [[leveraging_ai_tools_for_product_design_and_market_analysis | logo design]], perfect text generation, or [[creative_workflows_and_tools_in_ai_design | vector art]], it significantly reduces the time and effort required to produce a wide range of creative content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. This capability enables rapid content creation for social media, marketing, and various business needs, making it a valuable tool for anyone looking to build a startup or side hustle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

## Practical Advice
Brett encourages users to "get your hands dirty" and start experimenting with these AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. He advises leveraging ChatGPT to assist in communicating with AI tools and understanding which tools excel at different tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. It's recommended to pick a few preferred tools, learn their functionalities, and stick with them, rather than being overwhelmed by the multitude of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. The core message is that remarkable results can be achieved with minimal effort, breaking down the perceived "gatekeeping" around AI design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

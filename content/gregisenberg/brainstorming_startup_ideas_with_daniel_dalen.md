From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Greg Eisenberg hosted Daniel Dalen on a podcast to brainstorm and discuss three startup ideas, aiming to gain insight into Dalen's thought process for [[Developing startup ideas into businesses | flushing out businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. The session focused on evaluating ideas, discussing their potential build-out, and considering their viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Startup Idea 1: Credibility Plaques and Badges

The first idea was inspired by a dentist's "best dentist in America" plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

### Concept
The idea proposes a business that creates and sells "best product of the year" or "best e-commerce brand of the year" plaques and digital badges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Similar to the Better Business Bureau's A+ rating image that businesses pay to display, this venture would provide a credible symbol for websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

> [!example]
> The concept is akin to how "Product Hunt" allows companies to apply for and display plaques if their product wins "Product of the Day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

### Benefits
*   **Credibility**: Helps new products and Indie hackers gain trust in a crowded market, where generic "trusted at" logos are often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **High Margin**: Selling digital badges and physical plaques can yield up to 99% profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: Provides a visible endorsement that encourages user trust and potentially higher conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

### Challenges
*   **Making Noise**: The crucial part of this business would be generating significant buzz and authority for the "Dalen Institute" (or similar awarding body) so that companies value the plaque enough to pay for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

## Startup Idea 2: Embeddable Businesses

This idea stems from an obsession with businesses that can be embedded into other websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

### Concept
An "embeddable business" owns digital "real estate" on other people's websites, providing a consistent source of traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

> [!example] Offer Button
> Greg built Offer Button, a free tool that allows website owners to embed a button, enabling visitors to make offers to buy the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. This concept leverages the host website's existing traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

### Benefits
*   **Built-in Marketing**: The embedded element acts as a form of marketing, similar to how "Sent with Gmail" or "Sent with Superhuman" promotes the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>.
*   **Authority Leverage**: It leverages the authority of the host website for its own promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:32]</a>.
*   **Consistent Traffic**: Provides persistent visibility on a site that people visit daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.

### Luxury vs. Aesthetic Software
The discussion branched into a comparison of "luxury software" (e.g., Superhuman) and a new wave of "aesthetic software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>.
*   **Luxury Software**: Commands higher prices and offers a premium feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. Often serves as a status symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.
*   **Aesthetic Software**: Focuses on clean, clear, and visually appealing design that makes sense and draws attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>. This can be critical for grabbing initial attention, especially for new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:00">[23:39:00]</a>.
    *   While the core functionality (making the "car drive") is paramount, a good aesthetic on the landing page can significantly aid in validation and user acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>. Simple design elements like font choice, header, and a clear call-to-action can create a good initial impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:38:00">[24:38:00]</a>.

## Startup Idea 3: "Log in with Influencer" for Discounts

This idea was inspired by local businesses offering incentives (e.g., free coffee) for social media shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a>.

### Concept
Allowing users to "log in with influencer" on an e-commerce website to access lower price points or exclusive products based on their social media following (e.g., YouTube subscribers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>.

### Critique and Refinement
*   **Dual Class System**: The main concern was creating a "have or have-nots" system, potentially alienating 99.9% of customers who wouldn't qualify for benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>. This could negatively impact conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:25:00">[34:25:00]</a>.
*   **Reverse Approach**: Instead of a public-facing button, a better approach would be to scrape social profiles within specific niches and proactively reach out to influencers with offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:52:00">[36:52:00]</a>. This avoids public differentiation and ensures targeted marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04:00">[38:04:00]</a>.

> "The idea maze is helping you take that insight into a product that is has a high probability of working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:17:00">[39:17:00]</a>.
> It's crucial to acknowledge that failure or "bad ideas" are often more common than initial successes, but each failure brings you closer to the right solution by providing valuable information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:34:00">[39:34:00]</a>. Testing ideas, even seemingly "bad" ones, and gathering feedback is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:26:00">[40:26:00]</a>.

## Shopify Ecosystem Opportunities

The discussion extended to the opportunities within the Shopify app ecosystem for [[Profitable startup ideas | profitable startup ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:18:00">[41:18:00]</a>.

### Why Shopify?
*   **Money Flow**: The Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) space on Shopify has significant money flowing in every direction, making it easier to justify subscription fees for apps that save time, increase convenience, or boost conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:02:00">[45:02:00]</a>.
*   **Pain Points**: There are numerous opportunities to build solutions for specific pain points within DTC, such as:
    *   Supply chain and dealing with Chinese manufacturers (e.g., language barriers, distance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>.
    *   Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:44:00">[47:44:00]</a>.
    *   Email marketing and after-sales support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:49:00">[47:49:00]</a>.
    *   Store building (e.g., Instant, an instant page builder that optimizes for conversion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31:00">[41:31:00]</a>.
    *   Logistics (e.g., an app to hide China origin for tracking links) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:58:00">[43:58:00]</a>.

### Finding Pain Points and Niche Down
To find pain points, entrepreneurs should immerse themselves in a specific area of DTC, understanding the challenges firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:59:00">[45:59:00]</a>. It's recommended to niche down even further (e.g., CRO for local construction websites) to create a moat and avoid direct competition with giants like Google or even Shopify itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:00">[50:07:00]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Philosophy: Freedom and Bootstrapping

The discussion concluded with a look at different entrepreneurial paths.

### Bootstrapping vs. Acquisition Play
*   **Acquisition Play**: Building a product rapidly, making noise, raising venture capital, and aiming for acquisition by a larger company (e.g., Shopify) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>. This can lead to generational wealth but requires external validation and perfect alignment of stars, which is akin to playing a "slot machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:57:00">[52:57:00]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping**: Building a cash-flow positive business that can sustain and grow itself through reinvested capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:47:00">[54:47:00]</a>. This approach prioritizes freedom, less stress, and allows entrepreneurs to build something they genuinely enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:54:00">[54:54:00]</a>.

> [!tip] Freedom and Happiness
> Daniel Dalen emphasizes the importance of building a successful lean business that allows for a happy, simple life, surrounded by people who align with one's values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:16:00">[56:16:00]</a>. The amount of money is secondary to happiness; it's merely a tool to do things bigger and better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:41:00">[57:41:00]</a>.
>
> A key indicator of freedom for Greg Eisenberg is having a clear calendar with minimal recurring meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:13:00">[58:13:00]</a>. This can be achieved by leveraging automation and [[AI startup ideas | AI]] to increase efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:12:00">[59:12:00]</a>.

> [!info] Content Creation and Promotion
> There is a shift away from explicit calls to action (like "like, comment, subscribe") in content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Instead, transparently documenting the building process and sharing lessons learned serves as the best form of marketing, allowing the product or brand to promote itself organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. People who are interested will naturally seek out more information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>.

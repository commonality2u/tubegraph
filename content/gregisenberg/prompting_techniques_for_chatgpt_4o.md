[[ChatGPT40 and its applications | ChatGPT 4o]] is an advanced image model capable of creating high-quality, winning ads and visual content efficiently, often in as little as two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Unlike other image generation tools such as Midjourney, Flux, or Ideogram, [[ChatGPT40 and its applications | ChatGPT 4o]] functions as a multimodal language model, meaning prompting is less critical because it possesses a superior understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Core Principle: Visuals over Pure Prompts

The most crucial elements for generating effective ads with [[ChatGPT40 and its applications | ChatGPT 4o]] are the inspiration images and product images you provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This emphasizes the principle that a picture is worth a thousand words, significantly reducing the need for strict, lengthy prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

## Prompting Techniques

### 1. Using Inspiration and Product Images

This is the general advice for creating effective ads:
*   **Provide an inspiration ad**: Select an existing ad you wish to adjust or use as a style guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Provide your own custom product image**: This ensures your specific product is featured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Simple Prompting**: The textual prompt can be quite basic, as [[ChatGPT40 and its applications | ChatGPT 4o]] is intelligent enough to understand intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   **Example Prompt**: "Add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   **Benefits**: This method allows for the creation of super consistent and reliable ads by making simple edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. You can easily generate images of different audiences (men, women, old, young, diverse complexions) to test what converts best for various target groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. [[ChatGPT40 and its applications | ChatGPT 4o]] excels at creating photorealistic images of different audiences, or you can integrate your own photo shoot images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### 2. Generating Ads Without Reference Images

This technique is effective when dealing with well-known concepts, ideas, or brands:
*   [[ChatGPT40 and its applications | ChatGPT 4o]] possesses a strong understanding of popular brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge wallets) due to exposure to vast amounts of online content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   For less known or new products, always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Keywords for Photo Realism**: Use terms like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to prevent the model from defaulting to cartoonish or oddly colored images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Detailed Prose Description**: Provide a thorough description of your desired image. This allows [[ChatGPT40 and its applications | ChatGPT 4o]] to understand the context and generate creative results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Font and Style Adjustments**:
    *   For well-known fonts (e.g., "exo2 bold italic"), the model will have a decent understanding based on internet content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
    *   You can also specify color styles and aspect ratios in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
    *   The default aspect ratio is typically 9x6, but you can specify others like 1x1 or 9x16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

### 3. Iterative Prompting and Refinement

*   **Start a New Chat for Adjustments**: If your initial prompt doesn't yield the desired image, it's generally better to start a new chat rather than continuing in the same conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This is because continuing in the same thread often leads to a "recycle of worse and worse" images as the model uses its own flawed generated image as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Starting fresh ensures the new prompt adjustments are applied cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Be Clear and Direct**: While less strict than other models, clarity in your prompt is still important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Specify Language**: Explicitly prompt [[ChatGPT40 and its applications | ChatGPT 4o]] to write in English if text is required, otherwise it might get confused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.
*   **"Generate the image" Command**: To ensure the output is consistently an image and not a textual description of an ad, include "generate the image" at the end of your prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Temperature (Randomness)**: [[ChatGPT40 and its applications | ChatGPT 4o]] tends to have a low "temperature," meaning if you provide the same prompt, you can generally expect a similar response. This allows for predictable adjustments when making small changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.
*   **Refining Vague Prompts**: If an initial prompt was vague, yielding a creative but not perfectly aligned result, use that output as a reference. Then, in a new chat, specify more direct instructions to guide the model towards exact preferences (e.g., character positioning, logo inclusion, text placement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

## Leveraging External Resources for Inspiration

*   **Sora Explore Page**: This platform uses the same underlying model as [[ChatGPT40 and its applications | ChatGPT 4o]] and offers an "explore page" where users can view images and their corresponding prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This is an excellent resource for understanding effective prompting techniques and for ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. You can click on any image to see its prompt and even remix or edit it, including adjusting the prompt or uploading reference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Sora is noted to have less strict policy guidelines and is arguably better at photorealism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Ad Libraries and Templating Tools**: Resources like Creative OS, Forplay, and Icon.me pull data from the Meta Ad Library, tag them, and make them easily searchable for ad inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

## Strategic Ad Creation

*   **Experimentation at Scale**: [[ChatGPT40 and its applications | ChatGPT 4o]] enables rapid experimentation with different ad creatives, allowing marketers to quickly identify what converts best for various audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Exploiting Current Events**: Companies can now swiftly create ads that leverage new cycle moments or trends, as the process is no longer prohibitively expensive or slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **Personalized and Niche Targeting**: The ability to quickly generate diverse ad creatives makes it easier to target major holidays, niche "funny" holidays (like National Hot Dog Day), or even individual birthdays with personalized offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. This leads to more personal, funny, and entertaining ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

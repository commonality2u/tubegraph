A highly effective method to significantly enhance the output from Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini is to employ a competitive strategy, essentially making the LLMs "jealous" of each other [00:00:05]. This approach can lead to five times better results, improved copy, and overall superior output without additional cost [00:00:08].

## The "LLM Jealousy" Method

Traditionally, users might interact with a single LLM for a given task [00:01:05]. However, the competitive method involves opening multiple LLMs simultaneously—two, three, or even four at a time—for the same task [00:01:12].

### Steps for Implementation:

1.  **Initial Prompting**
    *   Provide the same initial prompt to each of the chosen LLMs [00:02:05].
    *   *Example:* For an agency named LCA, specializing in designing AI interfaces, the prompt could be: "I want to create a cold email for my agency LCA. LCA is the premier design firm designing AI interfaces. But I want to make it a cold email that will stand out. Can you help me do this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>

2.  **Comparative Analysis**
    *   Review the initial responses from each LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   Identify the best or most promising output among them.
    *   *Example:* Grok's initial cold email draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    *   *Example:* ChatGPT's initial cold email draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

3.  **Inducing Competition**
    *   Engage with an LLM that provided a less satisfactory response and inform it that another LLM (e.g., Grok) "crushed it" with a superior output (e.g., a 9/10, while the current LLM was a 5/10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   This may require "lying a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
    *   Share the best output from the "winning" LLM with the "losing" one, stating, "I thought you were the better LLM. What's going on? I will share what Grock did as an FYI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

4.  **Iterative Improvement**
    *   Observe how the challenged LLM responds. It often provides a significantly improved and more tailored response, aiming to surpass the "competitor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This new output can be incredibly polished and customized to the user's voice and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
    *   *Example:* After being challenged, ChatGPT generated an improved email with more personality, noting the user's background in building Reddit communities and designing for billion-dollar brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   This process can be repeated, taking the best output from one iteration and challenging another LLM with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

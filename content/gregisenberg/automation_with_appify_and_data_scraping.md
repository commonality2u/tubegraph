This article details a tutorial on [[using_ai_for_business_automation | how to use AI]] to create websites that achieve a number one ranking on Google, with examples and proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The core process involves leveraging AI and automation tools to generate content, optimize for search engines (SEO), and manage website data efficiently.

## Key Concepts and Strategy

The approach emphasizes creating "directories" which are powerful because users are often overloaded with content and seek curation and specific information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. A high-quality, valuable directory can attract significant free organic traffic through SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

A crucial element for SEO is **Schema Markup**, a way to structure data on a website to help Google understand its content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. For recipe websites, "recipe schema" defines properties like cook time, cooking method, nutritional value, and steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. AI can be used to write entire schemas for a site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Implementing schema correctly helps Google interpret and distribute information in "rich snippets," leading to higher rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Many large websites fail to implement schema properly, presenting an opportunity for newer sites to outrank them with AI assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

### AI's Role in Website Creation and SEO
[[Utilizing AI for scaling and automation | AI-powered automation]] allows competition with large players without massive advertising budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Content generated by AI from platforms like Claude or ChatGPT, once repurposed and published, can be indexed back into AI engines, making the site a primary source for AI-driven searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. This [[aipowered_workflow_and_task_management | AI-powered workflow]] enables significant content expansion from a single input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

## Case Studies

### Guilty Chef
Guilty Chef is a side project website created to generate recipes using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The site was built using Webflow for design and Zapier to integrate and automate content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. By prompting AI (e.g., ChatGPT) with restaurant names and menu items, thousands of recipes and entire web pages, including images, descriptions, prep/cook times, ingredients, directions, and FAQs, were automatically generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
The site started from zero traffic in March and reached over 100,000 monthly traffic by December, with minimal time investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. It has achieved number one Google rankings for specific long-tail keywords, outranking major sites like Trip Advisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

### Best Dubai
Best Dubai is a travel directory created using the same principles as Guilty Chef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. The domain was acquired for $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. Everything on the site, including content and scores, is AI-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. Claude AI was used to write the scoring algorithm based on reviews and other information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. The site managed to rank high in Google search results within 30 days, competing with established sites like Trip Advisor, despite not having their marketing budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

A unique feature for Best Dubai is the automatically generated, up-to-date restaurant menus with pricing. This is achieved by using a Chrome extension (created with Claude AI) that scrapes data from major delivery services like Deliveroo and Talabat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>. This allows the site to serve a highly underserved keyword niche (restaurant name + menu) and provide a superior user experience, which Google favors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

## Automation Workflow
The workflow involves:
1.  **Webflow:** A visual website builder used for design and as a Content Management System (CMS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. Webflow's CMS allows for creating "collections" to catalog listings (e.g., restaurants, malls, hotels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>. Templates can be designed, with individual elements dynamically connected to specific data fields in the CMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>.
2.  **Appify:** A platform with various data scrapers for sites like Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and Google Maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. The Google Maps Business Scraper is particularly useful for extracting detailed information about places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
3.  **Claude (or ChatGPT):** Used to repurpose and generate content based on scraped data, and to create algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
4.  **Zapier:** An automation tool that connects these systems, allowing data to flow between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Process for [[creating_aipowered_automation_workflows | Creating AI-Powered Automation Workflows]]

The general approach is to find real-world knowledge (e.g., from bloggers on Instagram/TikTok) and repurpose it into a format that AI can leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

1.  **Data Acquisition with Appify:**
    *   Identify a niche (e.g., Montreal travel directory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.
    *   Use Appify's Google Maps Business Scraper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
    *   Obtain Place IDs from Google's Place ID Finder for specific locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
    *   Input the Place ID into Appify to scrape detailed data (address, images, popular times, etc.) in JSON format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.

2.  **Orchestration with Zapier:**
    *   Set up a Zapier "trigger," such as a new row in a Google Sheet containing the Place ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>. This allows for mass uploading of data and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>.
    *   Add an Appify action in Zapier to run the Google Maps Business Scraper using the Place ID from the Google Sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>.
    *   **Crucial Step:** Use a "Code by Zapier" Python step to extract the full JSON output from Appify's results. Appify's direct output in Zapier is broken down, but the full JSON is available as a file, which is needed for AI processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.

3.  **Content Generation with Claude:**
    *   Feed the consolidated JSON data to Claude (or ChatGPT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>.
    *   Craft specific prompts to instruct Claude on what information to extract and how to format it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.
    *   **Formatting for Parsability:** Wrap the desired output titles in double asterisks (e.g., `**Place Name**:`), followed by the specific instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. This acts as an indicator for the next Python step.
    *   Examples of prompts include requesting specific data points (e.g., `**Website URL**:` `print the base URL of this place and append the URL with ref=gregr`) or generating scores based on criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.

4.  **Parsing AI Output with Python:**
    *   Add another "Code by Zapier" Python step to parse Claude's single text block output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>.
    *   The Python script identifies the asterisk patterns and separates the text into individual strings for each requested data point (e.g., place name, URL, score) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.

5.  **Publishing to Webflow:**
    *   Set up a Webflow action in Zapier to "Create Live Item" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.
    *   Map the individual data strings from the Python output to the corresponding fields in your Webflow CMS collection (e.g., place name to 'Name', score to 'Total Score', URL to 'URL') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.
    *   Ensure the Webflow collection is published for Zapier to detect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>.
    *   In Webflow's designer, connect the design elements on your template page to these dynamically populated CMS fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>.

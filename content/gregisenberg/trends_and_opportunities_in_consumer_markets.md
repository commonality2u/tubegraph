This episode explores how to build a Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) business by leveraging data and trends. The insights shared are also applicable to software startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Ashwin, an expert in launching and growing consumer brands, discusses how he identifies opportunities and creates unfair advantages in building successful startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The core focus is on evaluating opportunities and understanding market demand *before* building a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Evaluating Opportunities with Data and Trends

Ashwin emphasizes the use of software tools to evaluate market opportunities and make informed product decisions.

### Ahrefs: Analyzing Search Volume and Keyword Difficulty

Ahrefs is primarily an SEO tool, but it's highly valuable for understanding category demand and trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
It provides:
*   **Search Volume:** A general sense of how many Google searches a keyword or term receives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Keyword Difficulty:** An indication of how hard it is to rank for that term on Google, on a scale of 0 to 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

**Examples and Insights:**
*   **Electrolytes:** The term "electrolytes" shows rising demand over the years, with seasonal peaks in June and July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, its keyword difficulty is very high (88), indicating significant competition and making it extremely difficult to rank for organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Geographical Opportunities:** Analyzing search volume by country can reveal untapped markets. For example, electrolytes are very popular in English-speaking Western countries (US 45%, UK 19%, Canada 6%, Australia 4%), suggesting [[identifying_market_opportunities_in_specific_industries | opportunities]] to build similar brands in non-English speaking regions like Germany or India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This strategy, mimicking successful US tech companies in other regions, is a proven business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Solitaire Case Study:** An SEO expert used Ahrefs to identify "Solitaire" as a high-demand keyword (8.5 million monthly searches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Despite existing competition, he built his own site from scratch, out-ranked competitors over 24 months, and created a highly profitable business by capturing a significant share of clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Application to Software:** Before developing a software product (e.g., accounting software for vets or dentists), use Ahrefs to gauge search volume for the category and assess existing competition. This prevents building a product without sufficient market demand or in an overly crowded space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

**Importance of Analysis:**
It's crucial to go beyond raw data and ask "why" trends exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. For instance, the explosive growth of CBD in 2019 was due to the 2018 Farm Bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Its subsequent decline coincided with the rise of Delta-9 (legal THC), which offered a similar desired experience, indicating a shift in consumer preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. There is a potential [[opportunities_in_ai_and_consumer_mobile_applications | opportunity]] for an AI agent that can parse data, analyze category trends, and provide insights, similar to how SEO agencies interpret this data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

### Particle: E-commerce Sales and Product Insights

Particle is a tool for the physical product space, allowing users to type in any e-commerce brand to view non-public sales data over time from their direct-to-consumer (DTC) website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

**Key Features and Uses:**
*   **Competitor Sales Analysis:** See the sales figures of competitors in your market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Best-Selling Products:** Identify a brand's top-selling SKUs, categories, and flavors. This helps de-risk product decisions by showing that often, a large percentage of revenue comes from a few core products (e.g., 90% from top four SKUs, or common flavors like chocolate and vanilla) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
*   **Trend Explorer:** Particle also has its own trend explorer and insights feature for trending products and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.
*   **Other Sales Data Sources:** While Particle doesn't incorporate TikTok Shop data, TikTok Shop and Amazon both make sales figures public, allowing for analysis of what's selling well in certain categories (e.g., magnesium supplements) and assessing market competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

## The Case for Physical Product Businesses

Building a physical product business is considered one of the hardest business models due to the complexity of supply chain, finance, and inventory management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. Success requires strong operational excellence beyond just product and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

However, if approached with low stakes, it offers a phenomenal opportunity to become skilled in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. The consumer product world is at the "bleeding edge of marketing" because it's exceptionally difficult to capture consumer attention and persuade individuals to make a purchase, compared to selling B2B software where the value proposition is often clearer and easier to justify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

## Creating a Stand-Out Product: Marketing and Brand

Even with high category demand, standing out in the consumer market, especially for physical products like supplements, is very challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

### Differentiation Strategies

1.  **Look and Feel (Brand Design):**
    *   Many products in a category, like magnesium glycinate supplements, often have generic, medical, or unappealing packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
    *   Brands like Moon Juice differentiate with visually striking packaging (e.g., amber jars), even if the product formulation is similar to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
    *   Lemi, a gummy supplement brand by Courtney Kardashian, invested in custom, visually appealing bottling (hard plastic, cool ridges, purple color) to position itself as fun and accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

2.  **Positioning and Audience:**
    *   Lemi specifically targets a Gen Z woman audience through its branding and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.
    *   Seed, a probiotic brand, also differentiates by how they speak to consumers and their target audience, even though it's marketed for both men and women, influencer marketing often targets women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
    *   Especially in early stages, it's crucial to identify a niche and go hyper-targeted, then expand the niche as you scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

### Market Opportunities by Demographic

*   **Avoiding "Blanding":** The market has seen "Millennial Blanding" (e.g., Harry's, Casper) where many products looked similar, and now a similar trend for Gen Z with bright, vibrant aesthetics (e.g., Starface) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.
*   **Untapped Demographics:** These trends are often a byproduct of product builders being coastal people aged 22-35 who make products they and their friends want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. This creates an [[opportunities_in_niche_app_markets_and_sectors | opportunity]] to apply existing product concepts to different demographics not currently targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
    *   **Older Adults:** There's a significant opportunity to create well-designed, well-branded products for older adults (e.g., "Starface for older adults" for pimple patches) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. This demographic often has more disposable income and consumes information from less saturated channels, making advertising and brand building potentially easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

## Bootstrapping Product Creation and Market Research

### Bootstrapping Design and Development

*   **Cost-Effective Design:** For problem-solution oriented products (like Mighty Patch or Starface), design doesn't always need to be incredibly fancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. Simple packaging can be created using tools like Canva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
*   **Hiring Freelancers:** Independent freelance designers from platforms like Fiverr and Upwork can be hired for simple packaging or landing page design for a few hundred or a thousand dollars, allowing for early market testing with Facebook ads to gauge demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
*   **AI Tools for Design:** AI tools like Midjourney can generate initial design concepts (V1s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. These can then be refined by a human designer (e.g., hiring a freelancer for $250 to vectorize and tweak) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. This approach clarifies the founder's vision before engaging an expensive agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.
*   **Design-Dependent Categories:** Some categories, like spirits (wine, alcohol, beer), are "lifestyle brands" where intentional, sophisticated design and packaging are paramount for success, making bootstrapping design less feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

### Relentless Research of Category and Competition

Founders, whether building software or consumer products, must be relentless researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.
*   **Non-Alcoholic Wine Example:** Before designing, an agency deeply researches the non-alcoholic wine category, analyzing existing brands, their websites, language, and perceived positioning (e.g., elegant vs. casual, feminine vs. generic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
*   **In-Store Insights:** Talking to store owners about what sells, what doesn't, and what customers are looking for provides invaluable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.
*   **Software Application:** For software like a CRM for vets or dentists, research involves analyzing existing software reviews (especially 1- and 2-star complaints), and directly talking to staff in target offices to understand their needs and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
*   **Leveraging AI for Research:** Tools like Manis can conduct extensive market research, analyzing competitors, product details, and specific demographic needs (e.g., skincare for older adults) rapidly. This provides an "unfair advantage" by enabling comprehensive research that traditionally would cost tens of thousands of dollars and significant time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. This represents an [[opportunities_in_ai_and_consumer_mobile_applications | opportunity]] for an "AI agent for CPG" to streamline product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

## Key Takeaway

Regardless of whether you're building software or physical products, success hinges on working backward from distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Identify the channels where you can acquire customers and win, then build your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. As the adage goes, "first-time founders focus on product, second-time founders focus on distribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>. Many subpar products succeed due to incredible distribution and operational excellence, underscoring its critical importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

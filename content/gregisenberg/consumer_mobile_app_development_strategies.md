Hunter Isacson, a mobile app developer with over 300 million consumer app downloads, shares his playbook for growing a consumer app from zero to $1 million in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. He believes there's a current opportunity in consumer AI and mobile apps to build startups and generate significant revenue without venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Hunter Isacson's Playbook for $1M MRR Apps

Hunter Isacson outlines a clear strategy for building successful consumer mobile apps:

### 1. Build a Simple Experience (V1 MVP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>
Start by defining the bare-bones Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features that solve a core problem, even if it's unoptimized or rough around the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

### 2. Get Users On Quickly & Test Content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>
Acquire a few hundred or thousand initial users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. Test content on platforms like TikTok or Instagram Reels, even during the pre-order stage, to see how people respond to the app's premise or formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

### 3. Select a Core Action (Northstar Metric) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>
Identify a single "northstar metric" that matters most and orient all decisions around increasing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Aim for a high percentage of users (over 90%) to complete this core action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Focus on a single, linear user flow to make it easy to track success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.

*   **Examples of Northstar Metrics:**
    *   **Wink (make new friends app):** Percentage of users who get a match on their first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
    *   **NGL (anonymous messaging):** Percentage of users sharing the link and a few replies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
    *   **Bags (crypto app):** How many people fund their accounts and make one trade on the first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

### 4. Integrate Sharing/Inviting into the Core Action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>
To build in virality, incorporate a sharing or inviting mechanism directly into the app's core experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. This increases the K-factor and reduces reliance on external marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

### 5. Continuously Seed and Scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>
Once the core action conversion is proven, apply pressure by seeding the app in diverse audiences, niches, and countries, often working with creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

### CalAI
CalAI is highlighted for its successful packaging of publicly available AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Its success lies in creating an excellent onboarding experience and funnel, making a simple calorie-tracking app seem more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. It married creators with a simple app and AI to achieve growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Hallow
Hallow, a Christian and Catholic prayer app, succeeded by making religious content mobile, digital, and appealing to younger audiences through features like push notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. It focuses on a strong single-player daily use case (daily prayers, meditations) before adding multiplayer features like community challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The app charges $69.99 for a yearly plan and $120 for a family plan of up to six members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Opportunities exist to create similar spiritual apps for other religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. An [[aidriven_mobile_app_startups | AI-first version]] of Hallow could involve using GPT vision for content creation (e.g., overlaying Bible quotes on scenery) or generating answers to complex religious questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Locket
Locket gained traction by being the first to leverage iPhone widget functionality socially, allowing users to share photos directly to friends' home screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. It became popular within relationship and best friend communities on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Locket serves as an example of identifying and exploiting new platform real estate and features (like widgets) as they emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Hunter suggests "Live Activities" and "lock screen widgets" on iOS as potential future opportunities for new app ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### NGL
NGL, an anonymous messaging app with 250 million downloads, achieved massive growth with less than $10,000 in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. Its success stemmed from launching right when Instagram opened its link-sharing feature to all users in October 2021, creating a new channel for an existing idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. The strategy involved seeding the app through [[influencer_marketing_strategies for apps | creators]] on TikTok and Instagram to activate a viral growth loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### Bags
Bags is a consumer crypto app that focused on [[building_a_brand_and_user_experience_for_apps | building a cool brand]] and community from early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. It implemented growth loops like users logging in with Twitter, claiming a unique link, sharing it, and tracking invites on a leaderboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. This strategy built hype and buzz, leading to over 100,000 Twitter followers before focusing heavily on product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

### Pangu
Pangu, an [[aidriven_mobile_app_startups | AI-powered virtual pet app]], is an example of taking an existing concept (virtual pets) and enhancing it with new technology (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

## Core Pillars of Success

### [[building_a_brand_and_user_experience_for_apps | Branding and User Experience]]
*   **Simple, Resonant Names:** Apps like Wink, NGL (Not Gonna Lie), and Bags (crypto slang) use short, simple names that people can easily understand and resonate with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. Using slang from a specific community can set a young, comfortable, and colloquial tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **Authentic Voice:** Present the app authentically, using a relatable, memeable, and funny voice in public communications and in-app copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. This builds affinity and trust, making users want to "stay a while" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
*   **Solo Design Approach:** Hunter Isacson personally designs all his apps, including branding, using tools like Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

### [[using_organic_growth_for_mobile_apps | Growth Strategies and Virality]]
*   **Creator-Led Growth:** Leveraging [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_apps | creators]] on TikTok and Instagram is crucial for seeding an app and activating growth loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **Organic vs. Paid Seeding:** While predominantly organic, some paid seeding (e.g., $50-$100 payments to influencers) can kickstart momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. The goal is to build things that scale from a small initial test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Finding New Channels:** Revisit old, popular ideas and apply them to new platforms or features (e.g., anonymous messaging on Instagram links, virtual pets with AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Look for unoptimized or unexploited opportunities within existing platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

## [[innovations_and_trends_in_the_mobile_app_ecosystem | Future Trends and Opportunities]]

*   **[[aidriven_mobile_app_startups | Consumer AI]] and Mobile Apps:** There is a significant window now to build startups in this space without needing venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Crypto Apps:** The increasing mainstream acceptance and regulation of crypto present an exciting opportunity for consumer applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
*   **Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses:** Anticipated AR glasses are seen as the next hardware platform, offering immersive, shareable experiences that could be driven by advanced phones running local AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>. This could enable creation of anything that can be seen in immersive detail and shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.
*   **Local AI Models on Phones:** Future phones might handle more advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and computations locally, reducing reliance on cloud processing for AR glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Developers

Hunter advises young people, especially those in their teens and twenties, to focus on building consumer mobile apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>.

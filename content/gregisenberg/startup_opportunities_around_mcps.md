[[understanding_mcps_and_their_importance | MCPs]] (Machine Compute Protocols) have garnered significant attention, despite many not fully grasping their implications or the [[startup_ideas_and_innovation | startup opportunities]] they present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Professor Ross Mike provides clarity on [[understanding_mcps_and_their_importance | MCPs]] and outlines potential [[startup_ideas_and_innovation | startup ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## The Evolution of LLMs and Tools
Initially, Large Language Models (LLMs) by themselves were incapable of meaningful actions like sending emails or performing specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Their primary function was predicting the next word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The next evolution involved combining LLMs with external tools, such as APIs, to enable functionalities like searching the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

However, integrating multiple tools with LLMs is challenging, cumbersome, and frustrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This "gluing" of different tools makes it difficult to achieve cohesiveness and prevent issues like hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Even minor updates to an API can lead to system failures and require significant engineering effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This complexity is why a comprehensive, Iron Man-level Jarvis assistant doesn't yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## How MCP Solves the Problem
[[understanding_mcps_and_their_importance | MCP]] acts as a crucial layer between an LLM and various services or tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. It translates the disparate "languages" of different tools into a unified language that the LLM can easily understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This simplification enables LLMs to seamlessly connect with and access external resources like databases or web services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### The MCP Ecosystem
The [[understanding_mcps_and_their_importance | MCP]] ecosystem comprises:
*   **MCP Client:** The LLM-facing side (e.g., Tempo, Wind Surf, Cursor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **MCP Protocol:** The two-way connection standard between the client and server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **MCP Server:** Translates the external service's capabilities for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Service providers are responsible for building their own [[the_challenges_of_implementing_mcp_servers | MCP servers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Service:** The external tool or API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

This architecture means that LLMs will become more capable, but it places the responsibility of building [[the_challenges_of_implementing_mcp_servers | MCP servers]] on service providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Essentially, [[understanding_mcps_and_their_importance | MCP]] establishes a standard for LLMs, allowing them to communicate with diverse services efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

## Startup Opportunities
The emergence of [[understanding_mcps_and_their_importance | MCPs]] opens up new avenues for [[startup_ideas_and_innovation | startups]].

### For Technical Entrepreneurs
There are significant opportunities for technical individuals:

*   **MCP App Store:** Professor Ross Mike suggests an "MCP App Store" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
    *   This platform would allow users to browse and easily deploy [[the_challenges_of_implementing_mcp_servers | MCP servers]] from various repositories (e.g., GitHub code) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
    *   Users could click "install" or "deploy" to get a specific URL for their server, which they could then paste into an [[understanding_mcps_and_their_importance | MCP]] client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
    *   This concept addresses the current annoyance and complexity of setting up [[the_challenges_of_implementing_mcp_servers | MCP servers]], which often involves manual downloading and file management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

### For Non-Technical Entrepreneurs
For those less technical, the primary focus should be observation and strategic timing:

*   **Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date with platforms developing [[understanding_mcps_and_their_importance | MCP]] capabilities and monitor the evolution of the standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **Observe and Learn:** The [[understanding_mcps_and_their_importance | MCP]] standard is still very early and subject to change (e.g., Anthropic updates, potential new standards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   **Strategic Action:** Professor Ross Mike advises waiting until the standard is finalized and widely adopted by service providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. Once integration becomes seamless, "strike" at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Focus on Integration:** [[understanding_mcps_and_their_importance | MCP]] will make integrations much easier, similar to stacking Lego pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. This could lead to a wave of user-friendly interfaces with integrated tools.

```ad-note
While the current landscape might not present immediate "crazy business opportunities" for non-technical individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>, understanding [[understanding_mcps_and_their_importance | MCP]] will be key to understanding future developments and acting swiftly when the market matures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Poly is an [[ai_product_designers | AI product designer]] startup from Y Combinator that claims to help non-designers create "production ready designs and front-end code with AI" simply by writing in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This review explores the tool's capabilities, user experience, and effectiveness based on a first-time, live demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Initial Experience with Poly

Upon signing up, Poly automatically creates a first project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The interface is described as being "almost like Chat GPT but for design," allowing users to type or use a microphone to describe what they want to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. A notable feature is the ability to upload an image, which allows users to draw a wireframe on a napkin and upload it for Poly to work from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

Poly uses a credit system for generations, with 50 credits per page and 25 credits per component, which can make it unclear how much real money is being spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Generating designs can take "a minute or less," but the tool lacks a progress bar, making the waiting process less transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## Testing with a Startup Idea: YouTube Analytics Tool

To test Poly, the reviewer used a startup idea for a YouTube analytics and prediction tool, inspired by a viral tweet about an algorithm that predicts tweet performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The goal was to create a Software as a Service (SaaS) application that predicts how changes to YouTube titles, thumbnails, and other elements would affect engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The desired aesthetic was "glassy, minimalist, and with colorful calls to action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

### First Attempt and Feedback

Poly generated a landing page for the imagined product, naming it "C2 Predict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. While the copy was acceptable ("AI powered analytics to optimize your YouTube content and maximize your engagement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>), the design did not feel "glassy" and, crucially, it produced only a landing page rather than the actual product interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Clicking on "Get Started" or "See Demo" resulted in a black screen, preventing exploration of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

This led to the realization that users need to know specific design terms, like "glass morphism," to effectively prompt [[ai_product_designers | AI design tools]] and achieve desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. The tool's claim of being an "AI product designer at your service" felt inaccurate, as it didn't ask clarifying questions about the desired aesthetic or user's taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Second Attempt and Improved Result

After explicitly requesting "glass morphism" and emphasizing the irrelevance of the initial product images (which looked like dashboards for generic website analytics), Poly generated an improved version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. This iteration was "a little more glossy" and "beautiful," featuring elements like a cumulative engagement chart and statistical confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. It also included "AI suggestions" and "performance comparison" features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. A significant advantage was Poly's ability to "literally built out the code," which is a helpful feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

## [[comparison_between_poly_and_vz_ai_design_tools | Comparison with VZ]]

The reviewer also compared Poly's performance with [[comparison_between_poly_and_vz_ai_design_tools | VZ by Vercel]], another prominent [[ai_product_designers | AI designer tool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### VZ's Advantages
*   **Transparency and Communication**: VZ provides reasoning and feedback during the generation process, making it feel like "actually talking to someone" and putting the user "more at ease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. It explains what it's doing and how it's thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.
*   **Feedback Mechanism**: VZ allows for direct feedback, such as asking if the design is truly "glass morphic" and receiving an intelligent response about enhancing the aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. This contrasts with Poly, where "you're shouting into a dark hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **Direct Product Output**: VZ was able to directly build the product interface from the initial prompt, including features like version comparison and AI recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **Visual Appeal**: VZ was generally deemed "a little bit nicer" visually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

### Poly's Unique Strengths
*   **Interactive Charts**: Poly displayed a "cumulative engagement chart" with hover functionality, allowing users to see specific data points, which was a nice detail VZ lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   **Code Generation**: Poly generated the underlying code, a significant advantage for developers aiming for [[using_ai_for_creating_production_ready_designs | production-ready designs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_ai_design_tools | Challenges]] and [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | Using AI Tools]]

The review highlights several [[challenges_in_ai_design_tools | challenges in AI design tools]]:
*   **Prompt Specificity**: Users need to know specific design terms and be precise in their prompts to get the most out of these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **High Expectations**: The bar for AI product output is now very high, requiring "incredible" results for users to integrate them into their workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Lack of Proactive AI**: Current [[ai_product_designers | AI product designers]] don't typically ask clarifying questions to extract user preferences or leverage current design trends unless explicitly prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

For [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | product design]] and [[using_ai_tools_for_web_development | web development]], the recommendation is to [[comparing_ai_tools_and_their_functionalities | use multiple AI tools]] to leverage their individual strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. For example, a design from VZ could be fed into Poly to see if it can be improved or generate code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. This approach of using a combination of tools, similar to how users might use multiple AI models for writing or research (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini), is key to getting the most out of them and [[choosing_the_right_ai_tool_based_on_user_skill_level | adapting to individual product nuances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

While Poly showed promise in generating a functional design and providing code, its initial output was a landing page rather than the expected product, and it required specific prompting to achieve the desired aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. In a [[comparison_between_poly_and_vz_ai_design_tools | direct comparison with VZ]], VZ appeared to be slightly better due to its conversational interface, transparency, and visually appealing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. However, Poly's ability to generate code and its interactive charts were notable pros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

The landscape of [[ai_product_designers | AI product designers]] is rapidly evolving, and while one tool might be superior today, another could surpass it tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. The key takeaway for [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | using AI tools for product design]] is to experiment with multiple options and understand their unique strengths to maximize their utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

Dan Chipper is incubating numerous AI startup ideas, several of which focus on the future of media and communication through artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A core concept he explores is the evolution of voice notes and interactive media.

## Advanced Voice Notes

The first key idea is "advanced voice notes," building on existing features like ChatGPT's advanced voice mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01]">[00:01:01]</a>. The premise is to enhance a traditional voice note by making it interactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29]">[00:02:29]</a>.

When using current AI voice modes to think through issues (e.g., business strategy), users often want to share their insights but also anticipate follow-up questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18]">[00:01:18]</a>. An advanced voice note would address this by providing:
*   A concise text summary of the voice conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53]">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   The ability for recipients to "talk to the transcript" of the original conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59]">[00:01:59]</a>. This allows for deeper exploration of the reasoning and context beyond the summary, reducing the need for repetitive Q&A and offering richer access to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17]">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Interactive Media and Storytelling

The concept of "media that you talk to" is a significant theme for Dan Chipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39]">[00:02:39]</a>. He believes the future lies in [[aidriven_media_formats_and_storytelling | media that you talk to]] rather than traditional "dumb media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41]">[00:02:41]</a>.

An internal project, "tldr," exemplifies this by transforming meeting recordings into summarized podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01]">[00:03:01]</a>. These short podcasts provide key takeaways in about three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21]">[00:03:21]</a>. Furthermore, a prototype adds an interactive layer, allowing listeners to interrupt the podcast host and ask for clarification, turning a monologue into a conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30]">[00:03:30]</a>.

> "I think that there's probably a hundred startup ideas just around that sort of concept... just think about the media you consume and then think about how can I turn that media into two-way with AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15]">[00:04:15]</a>.

This approach applies to other media, such as making classic literature more accessible. AI can create new versions of "great books" with translations tailored for specific demographics (e.g., a 30-something tech enthusiast) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09]">[00:17:09]</a>. These can be presented in multimodal formats like audio, video, or even an AI-generated Platonic dialogue movie, potentially with [[advanced_voice_notes_and_interactive_media | advanced voice mode interactivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56]">[00:17:56]</a>. This targets markets like students needing digestible summaries and intellectuals aspiring to engage with classic texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31]">[00:18:31]</a>.

AI significantly reduces the cost of storytelling, enabling stories to be told in contexts where it was previously too expensive, such as summarizing meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35]">[00:05:35]</a>. The total addressable market for this idea involves places where stories need to be told but were previously cost-prohibitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00]">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Monetization Approaches

For interactive media, monetization could involve charging per download, play, or listen, as this scales with the value derived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31]">[00:07:31]</a>. Subscriptions are becoming less appealing to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51]">[00:07:51]</a>. A new trend in [[Voicefirst technology and applications | AI pricing]] is charging per successfully completed task, which aligns well with the value provided by such services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22]">[00:08:22]</a>. For enhanced literary experiences, one-off access, a subscription, or even a luxury physical version with a companion digital interactive component are possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20]">[00:19:20]</a>.

## Voice-First Interfaces

A notable trend is the emergence of voice as a natural interface, particularly among younger generations (ages 3-12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28]">[00:28:28]</a>. This is partly due to parents providing Apple Watches instead of phones, leading kids to master Siri and [[voicefirst_technology_and_applications | voice-first interactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41]">[00:28:41]</a>. Advanced voice mode allows even non-readers to interact for hours, receiving patient, detailed responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10]">[00:29:10]</a>. This suggests a potential shift towards a new "oral culture" where interaction with computers and the environment is increasingly voice-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31]">[00:29:31]</a>.

For startups, exploring [[voicefirst_technology_and_applications | voice-first interfaces]] presents a significant opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50]">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   **Discovery Engines**: Consider a voice-first version of content or service discovery engines, like an "Expedia for voice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25]">[00:30:25]</a>.
*   **Conversational Dynamics**: Products with inherently conversational dynamics (e.g., addressing frustration with multi-option IVR systems) are better suited for voice-first implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12]">[00:31:12]</a>.
*   **Platform Integration**: As platforms like Siri, Alexa, and ChatGPT add voice capabilities, developers will have opportunities to embed their services into these voice workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20]">[00:32:20]</a>.

The rise of voice-first mirrors the mobile-first era, where companies optimized for mobile UX gained significant market share over traditional desktop players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58]">[00:32:58]</a>. Large companies are often limited in the risk they can take to overhaul interfaces for new paradigms, creating a "tremendous advantage for startups" to innovate with early adopters and then scale to the mass market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57]">[00:33:57]</a>.

## Distribution for AI Apps

When building AI apps, distribution is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33]">[00:34:33]</a>. One effective strategy involves building a media business first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57]">[00:34:57]</a>. By creating content around genuinely cared-for topics, a media business attracts a highly engaged audience with similar characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33]">[00:35:33]</a>. This audience becomes the initial user base for new products, providing hundreds or thousands of users on day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15]">[00:35:15]</a>.

This "distribution-first" approach is particularly potent in the current AI wave, which has reset the playing field, offering low-hanging fruit for builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54]">[00:35:54]</a>.

While newsletters have been effective for building an audience, growing them is harder now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14]">[00:38:14]</a>. A more contemporary approach suggests starting with YouTube to funnel subscribers into a newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18]">[00:38:18]</a>. Segmenting these audiences (e.g., by video source) allows for targeted invitations to apps, ensuring the initial users are the "right users" who provide valuable insights, feedback, and contribute to building a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39]">[00:39:39]</a>.

Example AI products from Dan Chipper's incubation include:
*   **Spiral**: Automates repetitive creative work like tweets, LinkedIn posts, and YouTube descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25]">[00:40:25]</a>.
*   **Sparkle**: Automatically organizes file systems with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37]">[00:40:37]</a>.

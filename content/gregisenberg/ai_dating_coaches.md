AI dating coaches are a new category of applications leveraging artificial intelligence, often built on large language models like Chat GPT, to provide advice and assistance in dating scenarios. These applications operate by analyzing user inputs, such as screenshots of text message conversations, and generating responses or pickup lines designed to improve dating interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

## Success Stories and Business Model

A prominent example discussed is the Riz app, an AI dating coach that generated $190,000 per month and accumulated 333,000 downloads per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. The founder, a 23-year-old, reportedly got the idea from a Tinder subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. This app functions as a "Chat GPT wrapper" focused on companionship and dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, providing AI-generated lines from uploaded text message screenshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. Its success is heavily attributed to effective marketing and branding, with the name "Riz" (a term associated with romantic appeal among younger generations) playing a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Referral flows within the app are also key to its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

The founder of what was initially believed to be the Riz app (later clarified as a competitor, Plug AI) runs a development studio called AI Riz. This studio has launched three apps, collectively closing in on $500,000 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>:
*   **Plug AI:** A texting assistant, similar to Riz, offering AI-generated pickup lines based on text message screenshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. This app alone is reported to be making $190,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
*   **Astra:** Provides [[ai_in_customer_support_and_automation | AI coaching]] for life advice, helping users work through challenges, discuss compatibility, and explore personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.
*   **Pallet:** Uses [[ai_in_design_and_development_tips_and_tricks | AI]] to determine a user's color season from a selfie, generating a custom color palette, personalized style, and makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

These apps demonstrate a strategy of leveraging existing technology, such as Chat GPT, to create niche [[ai_app_development_strategies | AI coaching]] services in different verticals, focusing on specific target audiences rather than being a "one-app-for-everyone" solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

## Sustainability and Risks

While successful, these [[ai_startup_success_story | AI startup success story]] models face specific risks:
*   **Platform Dependency:** They are built on top of underlying AI models (like OpenAI's GPT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. A significant change in pricing or policy by the core AI provider could severely impact their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>.
*   **Competition:** The market for [[ai_in_design_and_development_tips_and_tricks | AI]] assistant apps is experiencing rapid growth, with many new products emerging daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. This creates a crowded field where similar apps, like Riz AI and Plug AI, compete directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>.
*   **"Flash in the Pan" Concern:** Some critics argue that these apps might be temporary trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>. However, proponents argue that even if short-lived, the financial gains and the business skills learned are invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.

Despite the risks, the high profitability (potentially 65% profit margins after platform fees) makes them attractive ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. The strategy of diversifying with multiple apps across different niches helps mitigate the "all eggs in one basket" risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59:00">[22:59:00]</a>.

## The "Anti-Trend" Opportunity: Human-Powered Alternatives

A key discussion point arising from the success of [[ai_in_design_and_development_tips_and_tricks | AI]] coaching is the potential for an "anti-trend"â€”human-powered services that cater to similar needs but offer a personal touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.
*   **Premium Human Coaching:** The demand for dating advice or style coaching could be met by human experts who charge a premium, offering a more personalized and potentially higher-quality experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>.
*   **Leveraging AI Marketing for Human Services:** The effective marketing and positioning used by [[ai_app_development_strategies | AI app development strategies]] could be adapted to promote human-based services, appealing to the same audience but with the added value of human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.
*   **Less Competition in Anti-Trends:** Often, anti-trends face less competition compared to popular new trends, offering a unique market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Philosophy

The emergence of these profitable, albeit potentially short-lived, [[ai_app_development_strategies | AI app development strategies]] highlights a practical entrepreneurial philosophy:
*   **Financial Stability First:** Sometimes, the goal for entrepreneurs is not immediately to "change the world" but to achieve financial stability, such as retiring parents, supporting a cause, or buying a first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>.
*   **Transferable Skills:** Building and scaling these businesses, even if they are "flash in the pan," provides valuable experience in running a business, marketing, and managing operations, skills that are transferable to future ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.
*   **Profit-First Approach:** These businesses are often focused on generating significant profit rather than aiming for massive IPOs or exits, prioritizing immediate financial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>.
*   **Practicality over Grand Vision:** There is a perceived lack of financial practicality in some business advice, with an overemphasis on "changing the world" or grand visions before achieving personal financial independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>. As one speaker put it, "Sometimes you need to change your world before you change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

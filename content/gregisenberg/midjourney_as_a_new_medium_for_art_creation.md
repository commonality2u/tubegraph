Midjourney is presented as an entirely new medium for art creation, offering a different type of canvas and a distinct approach to problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It allows users to blend and balance entire aesthetics, finding harmony to achieve desired visual outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Once a "recipe" or aesthetic balance is discovered, it can be infinitely prompted into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Beyond Words: Visuals Driving Visuals

Initially, [[Working with Midjourney and ChatGPT for design | Midjourney]] primarily relied on text prompts and parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. While words are still useful, they are only the "tip of the iceberg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The true power emerges when using visuals to drive visuals, as opposed to semantics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This approach allows users to explode aesthetics and style space into seemingly infinite directions, reducing reliance on the base model's interpretation of style tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

In recent months, Midjourney has introduced concepts like Style Space, Style References, and Character References, creating a system that expands aesthetics into an "infinite universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This makes playing on a visual canvas much more engaging than simply blending keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Key Tools & Features

*   **Midjourney Web App:** Users are encouraged to move away from Discord and utilize the Midjourney web app (midjourney.com) for a better workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Explore Tab:** This tab showcases publicly available generations and is an excellent source of inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Users can search for specific styles (e.g., "vintage poster") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Image Search:** Within the explore tab, a search icon allows users to find similar results based on a particular image's subject matter and style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Prompt Actions:**
    *   **Use Prompt:** Copies the exact text prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   **Use Style (Paperclip icon):** Brings in an image as a style reference, focusing on its aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   **Use Image (Pict icon):** Incorporates the subject matter and elements (actual pixels) of the image into the generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This is a crucial distinction, as using an image prompt can pull in subject matter from the reference image, which is often not the desired effect when trying to match a style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **Stealth Mode:** For client work or private assets, users on the Pro Plan or above can turn on stealth mode in settings to prevent their generations from appearing in the public database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Liking Favorites:** Liking preferred generations (heart icon) makes them easily retrievable later in the "Organize" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

## Why Use Midjourney for Art Creation?

Midjourney serves multiple purposes for creators:

*   **Inspiration & Ideation:** It acts as a powerful inspiration tool, similar to Pinterest or Google image search, for brainstorming ideas and putting together concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Users have more control over the generated mood board elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Production:** With features like the new editor, Midjourney can be used in production to outpaint or add new elements to existing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Art Therapy:** For many, it's a fun and engaging tool, almost like an art therapy, where one can get lost in the creative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Discovery Engine:** It functions as a "discovery engine," allowing users to input an idea, see what comes of it, and then explore a "rabbit hole" of aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Creating High-Quality Art:** Skilled Midjourney users can create art that is indistinguishable from traditional art, even resembling "Moma-level" pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. This high-quality output can be used for personal art, website landing pages, or social media assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Creative Control:** Midjourney offers significant creative control, allowing users to mold ideas into living, breathing design assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Working with [[Exploring aesthetics and style references in Midjourney | Aesthetics and Style References]]

The process of generating images involves balancing various "aesthetic levers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.

### Style Reference Workflow Example

1.  **Start with a Style Reference:** Upload an image and set it as a style reference (paperclip icon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
2.  **Initial Prompt:** Start with a basic subject (e.g., "giraffe") to observe how Midjourney interprets the style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. This helps in making guided decisions for the next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
3.  **Adjust Style Weight (`--sw`):** To increase the influence of the style reference, use the `--sw` parameter. The default is 100, but it can go up to 1000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Higher values mean more adherence to the reference's style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
4.  **Refine with Text Prompt:** Add descriptive words to the text prompt to provide "assistance" to Midjourney, such as specifying the medium (e.g., "paper cutout illustration of a giraffe") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
5.  **Adjust Aspect Ratio (`--ar`):** Use `--ar` to set the image dimensions, especially for specific formats like posters (e.g., `--ar 2:3`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
6.  **Combine Style References:** Multiple style reference images can be added to the prompt, allowing Midjourney to blend their aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.

### [[Personalization and style referencing in Midjourney | Personalization]] and Fine-Tuning

Midjourney offers several advanced levers for greater control:

*   **Personalization:** By rating images in the "Personalize" tab, users can "teach" Midjourney their aesthetic preferences, including color, lighting, general style (photographic vs. illustrative), and even preferred subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. This fine-tunes the model to the user's unique aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
*   **Stylize Parameter (`--s`):** This parameter controls how much of the Midjourney model's (e.g., V6.1) curated aesthetics are applied to the text prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. High stylize values (e.g., `--s 1000`) result in a more overtly "AI-like" or "Midjourney" look, while lower values offer more creative leeway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.
*   **Style Reference (SRF) Codes:** These codes are like "coordinates" in a multi-dimensional Style Space, directing generations to a specific aesthetic location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. SRF codes represent complex elements like color, composition, lighting, texture, and pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. Users can find and curate these codes, building "aesthetic recipes" by combining them with their personalization and text prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.
*   **Weighted Style Blending:** When blending multiple SRF codes or images, users can assign weights (e.g., `srf_code_1::2 srf_code_2::1`) to control the influence of each style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. This allows for precise balancing of different aesthetic components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.
*   **Permutation Prompts:** Using brackets and commas (e.g., `{50, 100, 200}` with `--sw`) allows users to run multiple parameter values in one go, quickly comparing results and identifying preferred levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

### Editing and Refinement

*   **Editor Tool:** Midjourney's editor allows users to paint out unwanted elements (e.g., text) from an image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **No Parameter (`--no`):** The `--no` parameter can be added to the prompt to tell Midjourney what elements to exclude from the generation (e.g., `--no text`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Midjourney as a New Medium

Midjourney redefines the creative process by moving beyond the semantic limitations of text prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>. It's a system where artists can "steal like an artist" by leveraging a vast "Style Space" and countless "aesthetic levers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. The goal is to blend, balance, and find harmony between these complex layers to achieve a desired aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. This approach allows users to build up their own creative "world" with significant control over its aesthetic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

### Future Developments

There is potential for a marketplace where users can sell their personalized style preferences or curated style reference books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>. Further developments aim to physically manifest digital art generated in Midjourney, utilizing tools like robots that paint, 3D printers, and editing stations to bring creations to life beyond the digital realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

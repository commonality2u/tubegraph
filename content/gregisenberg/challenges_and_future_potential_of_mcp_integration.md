MCP, or Model Context Protocol, has gained significant attention, but its exact meaning and associated startup opportunities are often unclear to many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article aims to clarify what MCP is, its current challenges, and its future potential, drawing insights from Professor Ross Mike's explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Understanding MCP

At its core, MCP is a standard designed to facilitate communication between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external services or "tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. In programming, standards are crucial as they enable different systems to communicate seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Limitations of LLMs Alone
Initially, LLMs were largely incapable of performing meaningful actions beyond predicting the next text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. For example, an LLM could not send an email or perform a specific task on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Their primary function was predicting the next word in a sequence, like completing "My Big Fat Greek" with "Wedding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Evolution: LLMs + Tools
The next advancement involved developers combining LLMs with external tools, such as APIs, to extend their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This enabled LLMs to perform actions like searching the internet (e.g., Perplexity) or automating tasks like logging emails into a spreadsheet via services like Zapier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### The Problem Before MCP
While connecting LLMs with tools was a step forward, it quickly became frustrating and cumbersome when trying to build assistants that performed multiple functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This "gluing" of different tools led to a "nightmare" in making them cohesive and reliable, hindering the development of advanced AI assistants like Iron Man's Jarvis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Each service provider's API often had different requirements, making integration feel like connecting tools speaking different languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Furthermore, updates to a service's API could break existing automations, making maintenance terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

### MCP as a Unified Language
MCP addresses these [[Challenges and solutions in AI app development | challenges]] by acting as a translation layer between the LLM and various services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. It unifies all these "different languages" into one consistent language that the LLM can understand, simplifying connections to external resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This standardization reduces manual work, step-by-step planning, and edge cases that cause failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

The MCP ecosystem involves:
*   **MCP Client**: The LLM-facing side (e.g., Tempo, Windsurf, Cursor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **MCP Protocol**: The two-way connection between the client and server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **MCP Server**: Translates the external service's capabilities for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Service**: The external tool or API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

Notably, the responsibility for building and maintaining the MCP server now falls on the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This strategy, spearheaded by Anthropic, offloads the integration burden from LLM developers to the service providers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

## Current [[Challenges and Opportunities in Adopting AI | Challenges]] of MCP Adoption

Despite its promise, MCP is not without its current [[AIdriven business opportunities and challenges | challenges]]:
*   **Setup Annoyances**: Setting up an MCP server can be annoying, involving multiple downloads and file manipulations, often with local dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. These "kinks" need to be ironed out for wider adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Early Stages**: The standard is still in its early stages. There's uncertainty if MCP has "fully won" as the definitive standard or if updates/alternative standards will emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

## Future Potential and [[Opportunities for startups with MCP implementation | Startup Opportunities]]

Once the MCP standard is finalized and polished, its potential is significant:
*   **Increased LLM Capability**: MCP makes LLMs vastly more capable by providing a structured way to access external services, allowing them to perform complex, meaningful tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **Seamless Integration**: With a unified standard, integrating services becomes much easier, akin to connecting "Lego pieces" that can be continuously stacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. This will reduce the engineering hours and maintenance headaches currently associated with tool integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **Technical Startup Opportunity**: A notable startup idea for technical individuals is an **MCP App Store** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. This platform would allow users to browse different MCP servers (e.g., on GitHub), click "install" or "deploy," receive a URL, and paste it into an MCP client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   **Strategic Observation for Non-Technical Individuals**: For non-technical people or business owners, the key is to stay updated on platforms building MCP capability and observe the direction of the standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. While it's too early for "crazy business opportunities," understanding the finalized standard will enable quick action when the time is right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

In essence, MCP is a crucial standard for LLMs that promises to unlock their full potential by making integration with external services far more efficient and reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Its evolution will be key to the next generation of AI applications.

Hunter Isacson, renowned for accumulating over 300 million downloads for his consumer apps like NGL (250 million downloads) and other apps (60-70 million downloads) in dating and crypto, shares his methodology for creating successful consumer mobile applications, including how to reach $1 million in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) without necessarily raising venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. His approach emphasizes simplicity in design, a strong brand identity, and a focus on core user actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

## Hunter Isacson's Playbook for App Success

Isacson outlines a clear framework for developing apps that resonate with users and achieve significant growth:

1.  **Build a Simple Experience (MVP)**: Start by defining the bare-bones Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features that adequately address the problem being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. The focus is on functionality that solves the core issue, even if it's not perfectly optimized or polished initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
2.  **Get Users On Quickly & Test Content**: Bring in a small number of users (hundreds to thousands) as soon as the core concept and MVP are built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. Test content on platforms like TikTok or Instagram Reels, even during the pre-order stage, to gauge audience response and format effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.
3.  **Select a Core Action & Northstar Metric**: Identify one crucial user action that defines success for the app and make it the "northstar metric." This metric guides all product decisions and helps prioritize tradeoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.
    *   **Examples of Northstar Metrics**:
        *   **Wink (make new friends app)**: Percentage of users getting a match on their first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
        *   **NGL (anonymous messaging)**: Percentage of users sharing their link and multiple replies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
        *   **Bags (crypto app)**: How many people fund their accounts and make one trade in the first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
    *   A high percentage of users completing this core action is crucial, aiming for over 90% in some cases, with a singular, linear user journey for clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
4.  **Continuously Seed & Integrate Growth Loops**: Once the core action is validated, scale up by seeding the app across different audiences, niches, and countries, leveraging creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. Incorporate sharing or inviting mechanisms directly into the core action to create a viral loop, increasing the app's K-factor and reducing reliance on external marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.
    *   For NGL, users posted the link on Snapchat or Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.
    *   For Bags, users would log in with Twitter, claim their Bags link, share it, and participate in a leaderboard based on invites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

## Building a Loved Brand

A critical, often overlooked, aspect of app success is the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. Isacson emphasizes:

*   **Simple, Resonant Names**: Choose short, memorable names that users can easily understand and resonate with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. Using slang terms from a community can set a comfortable, colloquial, and young tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.
    *   **NGL**: "Not Gonna Lie" – easily understood by young audiences as an anonymous app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
    *   **Bags**: Leverages crypto slang ("getting bags") to appeal to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.
*   **Authenticity and Voice**: Maintain an authentic and relatable public communication style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. This includes being "memeable," funny, and staying relevant, making users feel understood and comfortable within the app experience, encouraging them to "stay a while" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.
*   **UI/UX Design**: Hunter Isacson designs all his apps himself, starting from PowerPoint to Photoshop, Sketch, and now Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. The emphasis is on clear, intuitive flows that lead users through the core action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.

## User Experience and Growth Strategies from Successful Apps

*   **Cali AI**: This app successfully packages publicly available AI tools by creating an excellent onboarding experience and fostering user investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. It's a prime example of making a simple tool seem more valuable through clever packaging and funnel design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Organic growth for apps was achieved by marrying the simple app with creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Hallow**: As the top Christian and Catholic prayer app, Hallow digitized and modernized religious content, making it appealing to younger audiences (millennials, Gen Z) with push notifications and a colorful interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. It offers a strong "single-player" daily use case (daily prayers, sleep/minute meditations) and then adds "multiplayer" elements like community challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The app's pricing includes a family plan, making sense for spiritual and health-focused apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Opportunities exist for similar apps across various religions, focusing on passion for the subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Locket**: This app capitalized on the iPhone's widget functionality, being one of the first to make it social by allowing users to share photos directly to friends' home screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. It gained popularity through "relationship" and "best friend" TikTok communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **NGL**: This app succeeded by reinventing anonymous messaging for a new channel – Instagram's widely available link feature, which was new in October 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. It required training millions of users on how to interact with a new Instagram feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This highlights the strategy of applying old ideas to new platforms or technological shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. [[Using organic growth for mobile apps | Organic growth and marketing for apps]] was achieved with less than $10,000 in marketing spend for 250 million downloads, primarily through seeding with creators on TikTok and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Pangu**: This app exemplifies applying AI to existing concepts, such as virtual pets, creating a more interactive and human-like experience with AI-powered character animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.

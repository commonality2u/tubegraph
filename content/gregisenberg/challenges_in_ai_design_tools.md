The emergence of [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | AI product designers]] has generated significant interest, with tools like Poly and V0 claiming to streamline the design process [00:00:05 | 00:01:10]. However, practical application reveals several challenges and limitations in these [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | AI designer]] tools.

## Initial Output Limitations

One significant challenge is the discrepancy between expectations and the initial output. When attempting to generate a product interface, Poly initially produced only a landing page rather than the actual product's user interface [00:11:08 | 00:11:14]. This meant users couldn't click around or explore the product's functionality, which was a core expectation [00:11:47 | 00:11:50]. The generated landing page also lacked interactive elements; for example, clicking a "Get Started" button led to a black screen [00:10:35 | 00:10:48].

Furthermore, the initial designs often failed to meet specific aesthetic requests, such as a "glassy" appearance, leading to a need for further refinement [00:12:52 | 00:12:57]. The product images displayed on the landing page were irrelevant, showing generic website analytics dashboards instead of YouTube-specific metrics, which was the intended use case [00:17:08 | 00:17:27].

## The Importance of Precise Prompting

A crucial challenge across many [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | AI designer]] tools is their reliance on precise and informed user prompts [00:12:42 | 00:12:46]. To achieve desired design aesthetics, users often need to know specific design terms, such as "glass morphism," rather than general descriptions like "glassy" [00:12:24 | 00:12:48]. Without this specialized knowledge, the AI's output may not align with the user's vision [00:14:46 | 00:14:50].

This highlights a limitation where the "[[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | AI product designer]] At Your Service" claim falls short; a truly intelligent designer would ask clarifying questions about desired "vibe" or "taste" rather than requiring users to translate their ideas into technical design terminology [00:13:56 | 00:14:20].

## Lack of User Feedback and Interaction

Some AI design platforms, like Poly, can feel like a "black box" where users submit a prompt and simply wait for an output without insight into the generation process [00:21:10 | 00:21:14]. There's no progress bar to indicate how long the generation will take, which can be frustrating [00:09:18 | 00:09:27].

In contrast, V0 provides reasoning for its actions and interactive feedback, making the user experience feel more like a conversation with a human [00:21:05 | 00:21:16]. This direct feedback mechanism, where the AI confirms its understanding and details its plan, creates a greater sense of ease and confidence in the tool [00:21:26 | 00:21:37].

## Quality and Relevance of Output

While [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | AI design tools]] can generate aesthetically pleasing results, the relevance and usefulness of the generated components can vary. For example, even after multiple prompts, Poly's product images were still not perfectly aligned with the YouTube analytics use case [00:17:08 | 00:17:27]. In one instance, V0 literally copied the provided image in its design, which, while accurate to the prompt, wasn't necessarily innovative or uniquely generated [00:22:30 | 00:23:16].

The visual appeal can also differ, with V0 generally perceived as slightly nicer visually than Poly in some comparisons [00:25:59 | 00:26:03].

## The Need for Multiple Tools and Iteration

Given these challenges, users often find that a single [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | AI design tool]] may not be sufficient to achieve optimal results [00:28:32 | 00:28:36]. The "bar for all these AI products is so high" that the output needs to be "incredible" for consistent workflow integration [00:15:07 | 00:15:15].

It is often necessary to use multiple tools, leveraging the strengths of each, to refine designs [00:28:16 | 00:28:20]. For instance, one might use V0 to generate a design and then feed it into Poly to see if it can be further improved [00:28:18 | 00:28:25]. This iterative process, using a combination of tools, is often required to achieve a truly "[[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | AI product designer]]" experience [00:28:30 | 00:28:33]. Just as users combine tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok for tasks like writing or research, a similar multi-tool approach is becoming common for [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | AI product design]] and even [[use_of_ai_tools_for_design_and_branding | AI marketing]] [00:28:39 | 00:29:04].

The rapid [[the_evolving_scope_of_ai_in_product_design_and_development | evolving scope of AI in product design and development]] has brought forth tools claiming to revolutionize design by generating production-ready designs and code from simple English prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article explores the capabilities of two such AI-powered design platforms: Poly.ai and V0, assessing their effectiveness and comparing their user experiences in the context of creating functional web applications.

## Poly.ai: An AI Product Designer

Poly.ai is a Y Combinator startup touted as an "AI product designer" that helps [[utilizing_ai_for_nondesigners_in_creative_projects | non-designers]] create production-ready designs and front-end code using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Its interface is described as being akin to ChatGPT for design, allowing users to input text prompts or even record their voice to describe their desired design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. A notable feature is the ability to upload an image, such as a hand-drawn wireframe, for the AI to reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Initial Experience and Challenges with Poly.ai

When tasked with creating a SaaS product for YouTube engagement prediction with a "glassy, minimalist, and colorful calls to action" aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, Poly.ai generated a landing page rather than the internal product interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The generated design, named "Predict," included AI-powered analytics and optimization features, but the requested "glassy" effect was not fully realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Furthermore, clicking on interactive elements within the generated page did not lead to functional product views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

A key takeaway from this experience was the importance of precise prompting. The user realized that knowing specific design terms, such as "glassmorphism," is crucial to guide the AI effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This highlights a limitation: if the AI truly acted as a "product designer at your service," it would ask clarifying questions about desired aesthetics and trends rather than requiring users to have extensive design vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

Upon a second, more specific prompt incorporating "glassmorphism" and requesting actual product images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>, Poly.ai produced a more detailed product interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. While still not perfectly "glassy," the design was visually appealing, including a cumulative engagement chart, statistical confidence metrics, and recent optimizations, which were considered very helpful for the intended use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

## Comparing Poly.ai with V0

V0 is another prominent AI-powered design tool in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A key difference in user experience lies in V0's transparency; it provides reasoning for its design choices, making the process less of a "black box" compared to Poly.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. V0 also offers direct feedback on whether a design truly embodies a requested style, such as "glassmorphism," and then proceeds to enhance it accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

When given the same prompt, V0 also generated a functional-looking product interface that was visually similar to the inspiration image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. It allowed for predictions of performance and offered AI recommendations, similar to Poly.ai, but had a slightly more polished visual appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

Both Poly.ai and V0 can generate production-ready code alongside designs, a significant advantage for [[building_apps_using_ai_tools | building apps using AI tools]] and accelerating development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. Poly.ai also boasts seamless integration with Figma and existing codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Overall Assessment and [[Tips for Using AI Tools Effectively in Design Workflows | Tips for Using AI Tools Effectively]]

The current state of AI in generating production-ready designs shows immense promise, but also reveals that human input and understanding of design principles remain vital.

*   **Prompt Engineering:** Achieving desired results requires precise and specific prompts. Understanding design terminology (e.g., "glassmorphism") is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   **Iterative Process:** It often takes multiple prompts and refinements to get closer to the ideal design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Tool Strengths:** While V0 might offer a more user-friendly feedback loop and slightly better visual design, Poly.ai delivered a highly functional and in-depth product interface on its third attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
*   **Multitool Approach:** The most effective strategy for [[impact_of_ai_on_design_and_web_apps | utilizing AI for design]] is often to use multiple tools in conjunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. One could use V0 to refine the design and then feed it into Poly.ai to explore further enhancements or generate specific code components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

The "AI product designer" is not yet a fully autonomous entity that can perfectly intuit user taste or industry trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. However, these tools significantly accelerate the design process, allowing users to rapidly prototype and generate usable code for their applications. The bar for AI product output is now incredibly high, and continuous improvement in these tools is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

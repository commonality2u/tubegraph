From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

"Silent refactoring as a service" is a proposed business idea centered around using [[automating_business_services_with_ai | AI agents]] to constantly improve and maintain a software codebase in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:03">[02:11:03]</a>. The core concept is to automate human skill-based tasks related to software development that are often tedious or time-consuming for solo founders and development teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Core Functionalities

This service aims to function like an autonomous developer, consistently working to enhance code quality and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>.

### Initial Stage Capabilities
The first stage of such a service would focus on established practices in code analysis:
*   **Error Checking**: Continuously scanning code for errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:24">[02:11:24]</a>.
*   **Linting**: Applying coding style and best practice checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:27">[02:11:27]</a>.
*   **Code Analysis**: Identifying syntax and logic errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:30">[02:11:30]</a>.
*   **Fix Suggestions**: Proposing solutions for identified issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:33">[02:11:33]</a>.
*   **Automated Pull Requests**: Generating pull requests with suggested fixes for developer review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:50">[02:11:50]</a>. This capability is already seen in beta features of error tracking tools like Sentry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:38">[02:11:38]</a>.

### Advanced Stage Capabilities
The ultimate vision extends far beyond basic error correction:
*   **Continuous Code Improvement**: Constantly analyzing existing and new code modules for optimization opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:39">[02:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:44">[02:14:44]</a>.
*   **Simulated Testing**: Implementing changes, then simulating the application's behavior and running all unit and integration tests within a contained environment (e.g., Docker container or virtual machine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:47">[02:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:50">[02:13:50]</a>.
*   **Performance Analysis**: Running performance tests and iterating on code changes based on results, abandoning less effective approaches and refining optimal ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:04">[02:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:07">[02:14:07]</a>.
*   **Roadmap Integration**: Connecting to the product roadmap to proactively suggest improvements to the database, code base, documentation, and data schema that would simplify the implementation of future features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:58">[02:14:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:01">[02:15:01]</a>.
*   **Self-Commenting Code**: Generating fully commented code for both human understanding and the AI's future analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:31">[02:15:31]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure Experimentation**: Potentially experimenting with different infrastructure components (e.g., swapping message queues) to improve performance and reduce costs, showcasing significant agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:17">[03:17:17]</a>.

## Benefits and Value Proposition

The primary benefit is that the service operates autonomously, constantly working to make the application more performant and reliable without manual intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:40">[02:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:39">[02:15:39]</a>. This can save founders and developers significant time and effort that would otherwise be spent on maintenance and optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

The value of this "agentic approach" comes from having an AI actively engaged in problem-solving and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Such a tool could effectively replace the need for multiple full-time developers working on code optimization around the clock, potentially saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## Naming Suggestion

A potential name for this service is "Code could be better.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:24">[02:24:24]</a>. This name leverages humor and a widely acknowledged truth among developers that code can always be improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:46">[02:24:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:21">[02:25:21]</a>.

## Pricing Model Considerations

Pricing this service would involve balancing computational costs with the value provided:

*   **Cost-Plus Pricing**: Considering the significant GPU computation required for AI work (e.g., prompts, context building, embeddings), the service would charge for these expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. More advanced functionalities, like creating and running code in simulated environments, add significant cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Value-Based Pricing (ROI)**: Pricing could be anchored to the return on investment (ROI) it provides by replacing the cost of human developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. If it acts as multiple full-time developers, it could justify a high price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Pricing Tiers**:
    *   **Initial Stage**: For basic static analysis, error tracking, and automatic pull requests, a price point of $50 to $100 per month is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This would be charged per connected repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
    *   **Advanced Stages**: As more capabilities are added, particularly those involving more computation and higher risk, the price would increase. This could be based on a "cadence" (how often experiments are run daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. For example, a daily run could cost $20, totaling $600-$1000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

## Development and Niche Strategy

To bootstrap this idea, an iterative approach is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>:
1.  **Start Niche**: Instead of trying to serve all startup founders, focus on a specific type of founder or a particular niche (e.g., YC founders, specific SaaS founders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. This allows for training models with a specific language and motivation relevant to that niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
2.  **Streamline Existing Workflows**: Identify developers already performing some of these tasks manually (e.g., using ChatGPT for code assistance) and offer a more streamlined, automated, and unified platform. This involves centralizing information, documents, and conversations to inform the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
3.  **Iterate Based on Feedback**: The specific needs of early adopters will guide further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

The development of such a service would require understanding the nuances of AI and continuously playing with models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Building an [[automating_business_services_with_ai | AI-based business]] like this could also serve as a job application, demonstrating initiative and expertise in a field where larger companies might be slower to innovate due to existing product maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. The business could also be a target for acquisition by larger players like Sentry, who might buy it to gain expertise or eliminate competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

## Challenges

*   **Computational Cost**: Training and running highly specialized models for specific niches can be expensive, potentially requiring significant initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Trust and Control**: There's an inherent philosophical problem with allowing an autonomous machine to modify a codebase, raising questions about trust, quality checks, and sanity checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Enterprise Adoption**: Selling to large enterprises might require an on-premise version due to security concerns, where they would host the service on their own GPU-accelerated servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Diversity of Feedback**: A broad target market could lead to diverse feedback, making it challenging to build a universally effective product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This underscores the importance of starting with a narrow niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

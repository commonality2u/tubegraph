[[Building a business with AI tools | Building a business with AI tools]] and automating processes can be achieved through AI agents, which are software programs designed to perform tasks autonomously [0:00:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[0:00:14]</a>, [0:01:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[0:01:30]</a>). Joe Moa, co-founder and CEO of CrewAI, leads a prominent AI agent platform that facilitates this process [0:00:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[0:00:03]</a>, [0:00:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[0:00:06]</a>, [0:00:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[0:00:09]</a>). By the end of learning how to use CrewAI, users should be able to understand AI agents, orchestrate them, and even deploy them into production environments [0:01:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[0:01:12]</a>, [0:01:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[0:01:17]</a>, [0:01:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[0:01:20]</a>).

## Applications and Use Cases

AI agents can automate various business processes, enabling solo entrepreneurs, small teams, or businesses with employees to scale their operations [0:01:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[0:01:47]</a>, [0:01:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[0:01:54]</a>).

> [!example] Lead Enrichment and Email Drafting
> A simple use case involves lead enrichment where AI agents find information about a lead, determine if they fit an ideal customer profile, and then automatically draft a personalized email [0:00:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[0:00:25]</a>, [0:00:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[0:00:30]</a>), [0:03:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[0:03:25]</a>), [0:03:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[0:03:35]</a>). These agents can also generate ideas on how leads can use a product based on researched information [0:04:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[0:04:00]</a>), [0:04:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[0:04:10]</a>). The final output is a crafted email ready to send, including these insights [0:06:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[0:06:02]</a>).
>
> An example email crafted by an agent included ideas like "AI agent ideas tailored for CrewAI driven workflows," "remote teams," "automated compliance," and "dynamic customer engagement" [0:31:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[0:31:23]</a>).

> [!example] Custom PDF Reports
> Beyond emails, AI agents can generate custom PDF reports that are more tailored and visually appealing [0:00:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[0:00:38]</a>), [0:27:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[0:27:11]</a>), [0:27:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[0:27:15]</a>). This can replace the work of a junior marketing person or designer, potentially saving significant costs [0:27:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[0:27:43]</a>), [0:27:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[0:27:57]</a>). These reports can include company logos, specific insights, and be designed for leads to present in meetings [0:28:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[0:28:34]</a>), [0:28:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[0:28:51]</a>). HTML templates, potentially generated by large language models like Chat GPT, can be used for the structure, with AI agents interpolating dynamic content [0:29:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[0:29:16]</a>), [0:35:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[0:35:55]</a>).

> [!example] Long-Form Document Generation (Flows)
> For more complex scenarios, "flows" allow for event-based automation with multiple crews (groups of agents) [0:50:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[0:50:40]</a>), [0:51:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[0:51:28]</a>). An example is [[generating_content_with_ai_tools | generating educational content]] like a crash course PDF, where one crew generates a content plan (chapters, structure) and another crew writes each chapter in a loop [0:52:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[0:52:49]</a>), [0:53:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[0:53:11]</a>), [0:53:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[0:53:31]</a>). This enables [[leveraging_ai_for_creating_business_content_and_marketing | long-term content creation]] with many pages [0:53:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[0:53:43]</a>), [0:53:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[0:53:47]</a>). Visual plots of flows can help understand their complex structure [1:02:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[0:02:22]</a>), [1:02:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[0:02:41]</a>).

## Technical Aspects and Tools

### CrewAI Platform
CrewAI facilitates the creation, orchestration, and deployment of AI agents [0:01:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[0:01:12]</a>). It allows for defining agents and tasks, enabling multiple tasks per agent [0:06:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[0:06:32]</a>).

*   **Crew Studio (No-Code UI)**: A free tier on CrewAI Enterprise allows users to create AI agents by chatting, generating the initial crew plan, agents, and tasks [0:04:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[0:04:52]</a>), [0:05:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[0:05:03]</a>), [0:05:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[0:05:07]</a>). It can visually display tasks and agents, allowing for modifications [0:07:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[0:07:50]</a>). This UI can also generate downloadable code or allow direct deployment [0:08:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[0:08:21]</a>), [0:08:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[0:08:25]</a>).# Creating Structured Outputs and Reports Using AI Tools

> [!example] Lead Enrichment and Email Drafting
> A simple use case involves data enrichment where AI agents find information about a lead (e.g., role, seniority, company size, industry, culture), determine if they fit an ideal customer profile (ICP), and then automatically draft a personalized email [0:00:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[0:00:25]</a>), [0:00:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[0:00:30]</a>), [0:03:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[0:03:25]</a>), [0:03:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[0:03:35]</a>).

## Technical Aspects and Tools

### CrewAI Platform
CrewAI facilitates the creation, orchestration, and deployment of AI agents [0:01:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[0:01:12]</a>). It allows for defining agents and tasks, enabling multiple tasks per agent [0:06:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[0:06:32]</a>).

*   **Crew Studio (No-Code UI)**: A free tier on CrewAI Enterprise allows users to create AI agents by chatting, generating the initial crew plan, agents, and tasks [0:04:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[0:04:52]</a>), [0:05:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[0:05:03]</a>), [0:05:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[0:05:07]</a>). It can visually display tasks and agents, allowing for modifications [0:07:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[0:07:50]</a>). This UI can also generate downloadable code or allow direct deployment [0:08:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[0:08:21]</a>), [0:08:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[0:08:25]</a>).
*   **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: For more technical users, `crei create` can be used locally to define crew properties like providers and models [0:10:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[0:10:18]</a>), [0:10:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[0:10:23]</a>), [0:10:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[0:10:35]</a>).
*   **Testing**: CrewAI includes `crew AI test` for evaluating agent performance with different models, providing quality and hallucination scores, and execution times [0:11:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[0:11:39]</a>), [0:11:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[0:11:43]</a>), [0:11:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[0:11:46]</a>).
*   **API and Integrations**: Once deployed, a CrewAI crew becomes an API, enabling integration with other applications like Zapier, HubSpot, or Slack [0:15:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[0:15:43]</a>), [0:15:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[0:15:45]</a>), [0:15:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[0:15:48]</a>), [0:22:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[0:22:57]</a>).

### Generating Structured Output
Initially, AI agents work mainly with text-in, text-out [0:36:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[0:36:47]</a>). However, for reports or other structured outputs, more precise formats are needed [0:36:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[0:36:55]</a>).

*   **Pydantic Objects / JSON Output**: CrewAI supports generating Pydantic objects or JSON output, which allows for programmatic use of the agent's results [0:37:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[0:37:02]</a>), [0:37:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[0:37:05]</a>), [0:37:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[0:37:08]</a>). This is defined in the final task of the agent's workflow [0:39:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[0:39:40]</a>).
*   **Hooks**: CrewAI uses "after kickoff" hooks to run functions after a crew completes its tasks [0:47:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[0:47:20]</a>). These hooks can load templates, interpolate variables from the structured output, and then return a final, interpolated output [0:48:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[0:48:19]</a>), [0:49:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[0:49:16]</a>).

### Model Selection and Agent Roles
Choosing the right model is crucial; smaller models (e.g., 7B, 14B) may take longer and go into "blind alleys," while GPT-4o mini is often a good starting point [0:11:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[0:11:04]</a>), [0:11:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[0:11:07]</a>), [0:11:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[0:11:13]</a>), [0:11:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[0:11:23]</a>). Assigning specific roles (e.g., "senior email content specialist") to agents can significantly affect their behavior and the quality of their outputs, akin to prompting different personas in Chat GPT [0:13:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[0:13:13]</a>), [0:13:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[0:13:21]</a>), [0:13:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[0:13:31]</a>).

### Workflow Integration Tools
*   **Webflow**: Used for creating landing pages and collecting user inputs through forms [0:44:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[0:44:45]</a>), [0:44:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[0:44:46]</a>).
*   **Zapier**: Connects Webflow form submissions to CrewAI, triggering the agent workflow [0:15:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[0:15:54]</a>), [0:23:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[0:23:07]</a>), [0:23:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[0:23:11]</a>).
*   **Resend**: A transactional email service used to send the final email or attach generated reports [0:24:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[0:24:32]</a>), [0:24:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[0:24:45]</a>).
*   **PDF.co**: A service that converts HTML output from AI agents into PDF files [1:21:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[0:21:42]</a>), [1:21:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:46">[0:21:46]</a>), [1:21:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:48">[0:21:48]</a>).

## Learning and Optimization

While AI tools like Cursor can rapidly generate code and logic for agents and tasks [0:41:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[0:41:45]</a>), initial outputs may be "fuzzy" [0:46:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[0:46:40]</a>). It is often best to start with a basic working solution and then iterate and optimize for precision and consistency [0:44:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[0:44:48]</a>), [0:45:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[0:45:00]</a>), [0:45:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[0:45:51]</a>). This involves refining prompts, agent roles, and task definitions [0:37:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[0:37:56]</a>), [0:46:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[0:46:46]</a>). Adding tools like search and scraping (e.g., using Serper) can provide agents with more relevant and up-to-date information [1:14:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[0:14:16]</a>), [1:14:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[0:14:23]</a>).

> [!info] Recommended Learning
> To dive deeper into AI agents and CrewAI, consider the courses offered by Andrew Ng on DeepLearning.AI [1:41:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[0:41:10]</a>). The first course provides an introduction for beginners, covering agents, tools, and LLMs [1:41:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20">[0:41:20]</a>), [1:41:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:24">[0:41:24]</a>). A second, more practical course discusses real-world company applications and includes interviews, such as with the CTO of Gen on how PWC [[optimizing_workflow_with_ai_design_tools | uses AI tools]] in production [1:41:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[0:41:41]</a>), [1:41:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[0:41:43]</a>), [1:41:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:47">[0:41:47]</a>), [1:41:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:50">[0:41:50]</a>).

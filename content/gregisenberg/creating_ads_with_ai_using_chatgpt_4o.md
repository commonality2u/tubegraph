[[creating_aigenerated_commercials | Creating AI-generated commercials]] that are successful can significantly increase a business's Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The key skill is learning how to prompt ChatGPT 4o, the new image model, to maximize its output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This guide covers techniques for creating winning ads, memes, and visual content using ChatGPT 4o <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Why ChatGPT 4o for Ads?
ChatGPT 4o is a multimodal language model, not solely an image model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This means prompting is less critical and can be more straightforward compared to other [[using_ai_design_tools_like_midjourney_and_chatgpt | AI design tools like MidJourney and ChatGPT]] or Ideogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. ChatGPT 4o has a better understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Ads can be created in about two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Essential Elements for Effective AI Ads
The most crucial elements for creating good ads are the inspiration images and product images provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Providing Inspiration and Product Images
A common strategy is to provide an inspiration ad that you wish to adjust, along with your own custom product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

**Example: Jones Road Beauty Ad**
*   **Prompt**: "Add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   This simple prompt, combined with an inspiration ad and a product image, led to a well-structured ad with the woman at the top, overlapping products, and text below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   This method allows for super consistent and reliable ad creation through edits and adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   To test conversion for different audiences, one could generate hundreds of characters (men, women, old, young, different colors) and see what performs best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. ChatGPT can create photorealistic images of different audiences, or you can pull from your own photoshoots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This enables experimentation at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### When to Use Reference Images
Models like ChatGPT 4o have a strong understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge Wallets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. If your product is new, small, or lacks significant online presence (millions in ad spend monthly), always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. For well-known brands, you can simply prompt it by name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

**Example: Adidas Ad (No Reference Image)**
*   This example used a detailed prose description for the desired image, inspired by Sora's explore page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Key Prompting Elements**:
    *   Use "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" keywords to prevent cartoonish or weird colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
    *   Specify font types (e.g., "font type exo2 bold italic") as the model has a decent understanding of well-known fonts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
    *   Experiment with color styles and aspect ratios in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   The resulting ad featured a woman running with pyramids in the background, creatively incorporating the Adidas shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Remaking Existing Ads
You can provide an existing ad and instruct ChatGPT to recreate it for a different product, adjusting elements like background, pricing, or copy.

**Example: Athletic Greens Ad**
*   **Process**: Take an inspiration ad (e.g., for "Rise") and combine it with your product imagery (e.g., Athletic Greens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Prompt**: "Recreate this ad for ag1. Adjust the background to better fit athletic green Style. Change the price... to $85 now. Generate the image." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a> (Stating "generate the image" ensures an image result rather than text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>).
*   The AI successfully replicated the ad style, product placement, pricing, and copy, even adding a cool gradient background and icons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This process of remaking ads is already common in the industry through inspiration sources and templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### Changing the Concept of an Existing Ad
Existing ads can be adapted for new themes or seasons.

**Example: Ridge Wallet Ad**
*   An existing Black Friday ad for a gunmetal Ridge wallet was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Prompt**: "Swap it out and change it to a Christmas style ad." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>
*   The resulting ad effectively transformed the concept to a Christmas theme with the new product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   This approach opens up possibilities for targeting based on major holidays, niche holidays (e.g., National Hot Dog Day), or even birthdays (e.g., "Happy Birthday, 30% off by Ridge wallet") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   AI enables more personal, funny, and entertaining ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### Leveraging News Cycles for Timely Ads
Companies can now quickly take advantage of short news cycle moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

**Example: Rippling Ad**
*   Inspired by a controversy, an ad was created in the style of an old Wall Street Journal newspaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
*   **Copy**: "Rippling so good our competitors can't even resist sneaking a peak." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>
*   AI could potentially monitor news feeds (e.g., Twitter) and automatically produce these ads en masse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## Finding Ad Inspiration
Tools like Creative OS, Forplay, and icon.me provide inspiration and templating tools by reading and tagging ads from the Meta Ad Library, making them easily searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

## Using Sora for Prompt Ideation
Sora (which uses the same underlying model as ChatGPT 4o) offers an explore page where users can view images and their corresponding prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   It's a great way to understand how the best prompts work and for ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   Clicking on any image reveals its prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   You can remix or adjust prompts directly within Sora, changing aspect ratios or uploading reference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   Sora is noted for having less strict policy guidelines and potentially better photo realism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   It can help [[using_ai_to_create_viral_content | create viral content]] and find aesthetics not commonly used in a specific space, leading to more engagement and affinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## Prompting Best Practices for ChatGPT 4o
*   **Be Clear and Direct**: State exactly what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Start New Chats for Adjustments**: If the initial prompt struggles, start a new chat for adjustments instead of continuing in the same conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The model uses the previously generated (and potentially flawed) image as a reference, leading to worse results over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Starting a new chat ensures consistency with improvements from the new prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Specify Language**: Explicitly prompt it to write in English to avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.
*   **Default Behavior**: ChatGPT 4o typically generates one image at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a> (Sora allows up to four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>). The "temperature" (randomness of output) is quite low, so similar prompts usually yield similar results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.

## Live Example: Creating an Ad for LCA
This demonstration shows how to create an ad for a design agency (LCA) specializing in [[building_apps_with_ai_tools | building apps with AI tools]] and AI interfaces for large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

1.  **Identify Key Brand Elements**: Screenshots were taken of the logo, typography, bolding/italics, coloring, and client brands (e.g., Dropbox, Salesforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
2.  **Choose Inspiration**: A vintage Rolex ad was chosen to convey a "luxury" vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.
3.  **Initial Prompt Construction**:
    *   "Generate a digital ad for LCA (Late Checkout Agency). LCA is a SWAT team/design agency only for the most interesting brands on the planet helping them with building AI first tools. It only works with the best companies. I have provided some screenshots from their website for you to use as inspiration in the ad as well as a reference vintage Rolex ad as inspiration. Use this to capture the luxury vibe of the company. Generate the image." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>
    *   This was a "higher risk" ad due to vague instructions and a less well-known company, relying on AI's creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.
4.  **First Result Analysis**: The ad featured a man with fire in the background, good copy ("Leaders at billion dollar Brands choose LCA to Define their future"), but it generated a Rolex watch instead of incorporating LCA's services or clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
5.  **Adjustments in a New Chat**: A new chat was opened to refine the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.
    *   **Prompt Modification**: "Rather than generating a watch show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>
6.  **Second Result**: The ad maintained a similar look but replaced the watch with logos of companies LCA works with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>. It even included a CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.
7.  **Further Refinements**: To guide the AI more precisely, one could specify:
    *   Man pointing: "the man is pointing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.
    *   Specific logos: "include all of these logos" and list them by name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
    *   Text/Image placement: "text on the side with the image on the right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>.

## Future Considerations
*   **API Availability**: When ChatGPT 4o's API becomes generally available, creating hundreds of audience-specific ads will be trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Video Content**: While direct video generation isn't the primary function, images can be animated or used as inspiration for video content in tools like Runway and Sora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
*   **Dimensions**: The AI usually defaults to a 9:16 aspect ratio, but specific dimensions (e.g., 1:1, 9:16) can be specified in the prompt for different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

This era presents an incredible opportunity to [[automating_content_creation_with_ai | automate content creation with AI]] for unique and standout memes and ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

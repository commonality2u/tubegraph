Joseph Choy, an expert in consumer app growth, highlights how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming app development and marketing, especially through platforms like TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. He emphasizes that TikTok organic content currently represents the biggest underpriced distribution channel due to the low cost of content creation and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## AI in App Functionality and Development

AI is being increasingly embedded into mobile applications to enhance core functionality and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>:

*   **Color Analysis Apps:** Apps like "What Colors" utilize AI to analyze a user's hair, skin tone, and eye color to recommend suitable clothing and makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This provides a digital alternative to expensive human consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **Looksmaxing Apps:** The "Umax" app, for instance, scans a user's face to assess potential for physical appearance improvement, offering tips on aspects like jawline, skin care, and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.
*   **Sports Performance Analysis:**
    *   **Golf Swing Analysis:** AI can be used to develop apps that analyze a live view of a user's golf swing, providing tips on angle and speed for improvement, effectively acting as an [[innovative_ai_functionalities_in_apps | AI golf coach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. The alternative of a human coach can be significantly more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
    *   **MMA and Other Sports:** Apps like "KO" for MMA training feature wireframe skeleton overlays to analyze movements, a concept applicable to other sports like tennis, golf, or pickleball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
*   **Poker Hand Analysis:** AI can power apps that help poker players analyze hand histories and strategies, offering advice on betting and common mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. These can serve as educational tools for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

The recent emergence and improvement of AI vision technologies, such as GPT Vision, make these [[embedding_ai_to_enhance_app_functionality | AI-driven analysis functionalities]] more accessible and powerful for app developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

## AI in App Marketing Strategies on TikTok

The marketing tactics for apps are increasingly borrowing from the e-commerce space, especially on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Many successful strategies involve AI to generate content and optimize distribution:

*   **Mass-Producing Content with AI:** Companies like Tabs Chocolate, an e-commerce product that scaled to $10 million/year, used mass UGC (User Generated Content) creators to produce content daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. These tactics are now being applied to consumer SaaS businesses with higher margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   **AI-Generated Visuals:** Many viral TikTok videos use AI-generated images (e.g., Midjourney) instead of real photos, making content creation faster and easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This allows for rapid experimentation with different hooks and visual themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   **Slideshows:** Surprisingly, slideshows on TikTok (carousels) are performing very well, despite lacking the "human feeling" of influencer videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. They offer greater scalability and a lower barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Leveraging TikTok Shop Creators for Apps:**
    *   **Identifying Opportunities:** The TikTok Shop Affiliate Center provides valuable data to identify successful e-commerce creators who are generating high sales volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    *   **Pivoting to Apps:** These creators, skilled in converting views into sales, could be leveraged to promote apps instead of just physical e-commerce products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
    *   **Utility-Driven Content:** Developers can create apps that assist these creators in selling their existing products, such as a skincare app that analyzes a face for before-and-after videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. This allows apps to be integrated subtly into marketing content, often getting free promotion because the app provides utility for the creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

### Key Marketing Principles Applied to AI Apps

*   **TikTok as the New App Store:** Unlike the early days of the App Store where discovery was centralized, TikTok, Instagram, and similar platforms are now the primary channels for content discovery and, by extension, app downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Gaining traction on TikTok can significantly boost an app's App Store optimization (ASO) and organic downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Marketing and Incentives:** TikTok Shop allows brands to upload products and creators to sign up as affiliates, earning commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Some brands offer substantial prizes (e.g., MacBooks, Rolexes, Teslas) to top affiliates to monopolize creator attention, making it hard for competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Redefining Influencer Marketing:** On TikTok's "For You Page," content is prioritized over who created it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>. This allows brands to hire creators as "actors" for content creation, even if they have zero followers, rather than paying for their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. This makes influencer marketing significantly cheaper and more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.
*   **Niche Targeting and High LTV:** Identifying niches with high Lifetime Value (LTV) customers who are willing to pay more for solutions, such as golfers or poker players, presents a significant opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
*   **Capitalizing on "Cult Movements":** Developing apps that cater to existing, deeply rooted online "movements" or ideologies (e.g., looksmaxing, wealth generation) can lead to highly engaged and loyal user bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. These movements often revolve around universal desires like health, wealth, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.
    *   The "Umax" app for looksmaxing capitalized on a deep internet movement focused on physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.
    *   Crayo, an app that automates video creation, partnered with YouTubers who teach teenagers how to make money, productizing a "cult of money" course into software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>.

## Prerequisites for Success

While these AI-driven marketing and development strategies offer immense opportunity, it's crucial that the underlying product is high quality and retentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. A strong product with good retention metrics allows developers to understand customer lifetime value (LTV) and customer acquisition cost (CAC), enabling more effective and scalable marketing spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. Without a good product, marketing efforts lead to a "leaky bucket," where users are acquired but do not stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. This is critical for [[building_ai_apps_for_organic_growth | organic growth]] and long-term success.

This article explores an approachable way to make money on the internet by leveraging AI and "vibe coding" to create and sell custom software, often by identifying needs on platforms like Upwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The core strategy involves finding a buyer *before* building the app, ensuring that the idea is validated and desired by a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Identifying Business Problems and Startup Ideas

A key method for finding business problems that can be solved with software is to scour platforms like Upwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This approach helps identify what existing business problems and [[microsaas_business_ideas | SaaS businesses]] people are looking to create or improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Specific strategies include:
*   **Replacing Existing Software** Look for jobs asking for help with existing software (e.g., Airtable) where you believe you can build a better or cheaper custom app solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Identifying Automations** Search for job listings related to "automations," as many can be transformed into an app with a frontend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. For example, consolidating multiple tools like Google Forms, Airtable, Typeform, and Calendly into a single custom workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Unbundling Existing SaaS** An emerging opportunity is to "unbundle" or replicate features of large SaaS platforms (like Ahrefs) using public APIs, potentially offering a much cheaper alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. This also involves looking at existing APIs and building apps around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.
*   **Direct Outreach** Reach out to business owners and inquire about their most annoying tasks or most expensive software they use, then propose building a custom app to solve their specific pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.
*   **Building Broadly** Making many different types of apps can increase learning and serendipity, leading to new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.

## Validating Startup Ideas

The most crucial step is to find someone willing to buy the app *before* you build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This approach ensures immediate [[creating_validated_and_resonant_startup_ideas | validation]] and significantly de-risks the venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.

### Leveraging Upwork for Validation
Upwork serves as a marketplace where demand for custom solutions is clearly articulated in job postings.
*   **Analyze Job Descriptions** Look for specific problems, desired functionalities, and budget ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Assess Complexity** Prioritize "CRUD apps" (Create, Read, Update, Delete) that primarily involve putting data in a database, pulling it out, and visualizing it, as these are generally easier and quicker to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Avoid overly complex integrations or features like payment processors if starting out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   **Evaluate Pricing** While some jobs might have low fixed prices (e.g., $125), the core problem identified might be worth significantly more to other clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. The first app sold for $750, with potential for recurring revenue from hosting and future features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Submit Proposals with Prototypes** For simpler apps, build a quick prototype and send a Loom video demoing it as part of your proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This directly shows the client your solution and validates the need.

### The "Vibe Coding" Approach

"Vibe coding" refers to rapidly building software using AI-powered tools, focusing on getting from idea to MVP with minimal friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

*   **Prompt Engineering with AI**
    *   Feed job descriptions into AI tools like ChatGPT to format requirements into a Product Requirements Document (PRD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
    *   Use the PRD to prompt AI coding assistants (like Replet) to build the initial prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Rapid Prototyping Tools**
    *   **Replet:** A platform that allows rapid development and deployment. It handles package management, deployments, and provides a starting point for any project, overcoming initial "writer's block" for coders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
    *   **VO:** An AI tool for generating UI mockups and frontend code. This is especially useful for quickly creating polished visual prototypes, even from client wireframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   **Iterative Development & Refinement**
    *   After the AI generates the initial app, a human developer (or the user themselves) can fine-tune the code, especially for complex features or to anticipate user-driven breakage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
    *   For specific issues, Replet's "bounty" feature allows hiring other developers for small, fixed-price tasks, which can be a good use of money instead of extensive troubleshooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

## Business Models and Scaling

This approach primarily focuses on a B2B consulting or agency model rather than a broad consumer SaaS model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.

*   **Custom App Sales** You can sell custom-built apps for fixed prices, often ranging from hundreds to a few thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.
*   **Recurring Revenue** Charge clients for ongoing support, feature additions, and hosting services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Agency Model** Evolve into a development agency by offering continued services to clients and specializing in custom solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.
*   **Scaling through Duplication** Once a solution for a specific problem is built and sold, it can often be adapted and sold to other businesses facing the exact same problem in the same industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.
*   **B2B vs. B2C** Building software for businesses is often less complex and more direct than building for consumers, which typically requires significant marketing and distribution efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. The speaker ranks opportunities:
    *   **Easy Mode:** Get paid for a service (custom app development) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.
    *   **Medium Mode:** Build software for B2B (like a specialized SaaS for specific business types, e.g., 10 clients paying $1,000/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.
    *   **Hard Mode:** Build viral consumer social apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

Solo developers utilizing this approach can potentially earn $5,000 to $10,000 per month without outside help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. The core benefit is "getting paid to learn" and rapidly building a portfolio of functional applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.

From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

While Google V3 is widely discussed, fewer resources demonstrate how to monetize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. PJ, known for his viral AI films on X with hundreds of thousands of likes, has developed a clear process for making money with V3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This guide outlines his approach, covering prompts, processes, and tools like ChatGPT and Final Cut Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Why Content Goes Viral

Creating viral content with AI goes beyond technical skills; it's about understanding why people engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. With the immense increase in content due to generative AI, the ability to make content that people want to watch and share is more critical than just technical production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

It's crucial to connect with what you are uniquely interested in, as riches are often found in niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Anyone willing to put in the work can achieve success, as LLMs (Large Language Models) make cinematic content creation easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The core is creating entertaining content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Case Study: The "Puppine" Pharmaceutical Commercial

PJ's viral pharmaceutical ad, "Puppine," was created 100% with Google V3 AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The ad masterfully starts conventionally before evolving into an emotional roller coaster of satire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Ideation and Scripting

The process often starts with a "kernel of an idea hook" that is unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. For "Puppine," the initial idea was a satirical take on a pharmaceutical commercial, where a placebo pill leads to a dog delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This evolved into a pill that secretes pheromones to attract puppies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

The scripting process leverages AI extensively:
*   **Initial Prompts**: Begin with generalized instructions for [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | ChatGPT 4o]] (or other LLMs like Claude and Grok, especially Grok's "unhinged" mode for humor) to generate cliche scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Refinement**: Tear apart the initial output and instruct the AI to generate comedic examples, aiming for "zingers" or one-liners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. For example, lines like "He listens twice as good as my ex-husband and only climbs into the lap of half as many of my friends" were AI-generated and adapted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Iterative Process**: Continuously refeed preferred lines and directions (e.g., "Make it unhinged," "Make it non sequiturs") to the AI, refining the script over multiple prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Approximately 70% of the lines in the "Puppine" commercial originated from ChatGPT through this iterative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Style Guidance**: If you lack a clear comedic vision, you can prompt the AI to create jokes "in the style of Seth Rogen" or "imagine you're Bill Burr doing a standup comedy routine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Alternatively, take existing jokes from known satirical works (like "Deep Thoughts with Jack Handy") and reconstitute them into V3 settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Prompting for V3 (Google's Video AI)

Once the script is locked in, convert each dialogue line into a V3 prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   **Structure**: Use a simple prompt structure, describing what's happening, including poses, shot types, camera types, and background details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. ChatGPT can extrapolate full V3 prompts from simple dialogue lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Character Consistency**: While V3 primarily supports text-to-video (not image-to-video for consistent characters), you can describe characters in detail (e.g., "an old guy with short gray hair," "a white guy in his 30s with a mustache and a beard and strong chin with muscular arms") to achieve similar looks across shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   **Cost and Iteration**: Each V3 shot costs approximately $2-$3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. It's recommended to run shots one at a time to get feedback and refine prompts, as some generations might not work or may lack audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. For the "Puppine" ad, it cost around $500 in V3 credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.
*   **Audio and Subtitles**: V3 generates audio for the video, but it can be thin or lack voice consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. Not including quotes in prompts can reduce weird gibberish subtitles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.
*   **Camera Movement**: Prompting specific camera movements (e.g., "camera push in" or "dolly in") can make shots feel less AI-generated and more cinematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. You can also specify character emotions, which the AI can convey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

### Editing and Final Production

After generating clips (expect a 3:1 or 5:1 bad-to-good clip ratio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>, stitch them together using video editing software. Popular options include Final Cut Pro (PJ's choice), Cap Cut (equally good for this purpose), or DaVinci Resolve (free and professional-tier) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

### Crafting the Viral Hook

The headline and hook are as important as the video content itself, particularly on platforms like X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.
*   **Provocative Statement**: Start with a statement that intrigues the audience. PJ's hook for "Puppine" was: "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials. I made this for $500 in V3 credits in less than a day. What's the argument for spending 500K now? Steal my prompt below." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>
*   **Elements of a Good Hook**:
    *   **Flex**: Establish credibility (e.g., "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
    *   **Trendjacking**: Incorporate trending topics (e.g., V3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
    *   **Cost Comparison**: Highlight the massive cost difference (e.g., $500k vs. $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
    *   **Questions**: Engage the audience and generate replies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
    *   **Call to Value**: Encourage clicks by offering valuable content (e.g., "Steal my prompt") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   **Avoid Cliche Titles**: While phrases like "Hollywood is cooked" or "Oh my god, what the [heck]" work, find unique variations to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

## [[shortterm_moneymaking_opportunities_with_ai_technology | Making Money with AI-Generated Content]]

Here are several strategies for [[building_a_business_around_aigenerated_content | building a business around AI-generated content]]:

1.  **Build a Personal Brand**: Use V3 to create content you're proud of, establishing yourself in the AI content ecosystem. An audience is worth a lot of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
2.  **Attract Direct Clients**: Create sample commercials or content for specific industries (e.g., food products, beer companies, CPG brands, underwear brands) and pitch directly to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. You can charge anywhere from $5,000 upwards, recognizing your filmmaking skill and time are valuable, even if AI reduces production cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
3.  **Build a Portfolio for Agencies**: Create a portfolio of general or niche-specific commercials (e.g., knife commercials) to attract agencies. Don't be afraid to analyze and "steal" the pacing and flow from award-winning commercials to level up your skills, then tweak them to be unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.
4.  **Create Narrative Series with Brand Integrations**: Develop unique narrative universes (like Neural Viz's "moniverse") and integrate brands directly into the story as product placements or "artifacts from our time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>. This also works by taking popular social formats (e.g., "Man on the street," "Zillow videos") and adding an AI twist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.
5.  **Sell Courses/Digital Products**: Bundle your knowledge and expertise into courses, PDFs, or other digital products related to AI content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.
6.  **Do Consulting with Larger Companies**: Offer consulting services to Fortune 500 companies on integrating generative AI, ensuring legal compliance and security procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Charge based on the scale of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
7.  **Build a Sketch Comedy Channel**: Create a Key & Peele-style sketch comedy show. While harder to monetize directly, massive audiences (like those seen on TikTok) can attract brand integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.
8.  **Do Narrative Films (with caution)**: While long-form narrative films are possible, the rapid iteration of AI technology means the quality of early parts of a film might differ from later parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. Prioritize episodic weekly content over trying to replicate the old Hollywood model with its large budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.
9.  **Pitch Brands on Narrative Content**: Offer brands a unique narrative series where their products are integrated as central elements or "relics and artifacts" within the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.
10. **Pick a Small Sub-Niche**: Target underserved niches with high demand and low supply of content. Examples include:
    *   **Bible Content**: Stories from the Bible (open-sourced IP) have billions of daily active users and high engagement, with many views even for lower-quality AI content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.
    *   **BookTok/Romantasy**: Reach out to authors to create book promos or scenes from their books, as popular romantic series authors would pay serious money for marketing materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

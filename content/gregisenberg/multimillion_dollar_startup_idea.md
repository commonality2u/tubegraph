An "incredible multi-million dollar a year startup idea" is proposed: a SaaS (Software as a Service) product designed to predict the engagement and virality of YouTube content before it's posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This concept aims to help YouTubers optimize their content for maximum reach and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Core Concept

The startup idea stems from a viral tweet by Eddie, a 17-year-old with a track record of successful apps, who proposed an algorithm to simulate user reactions to tweets, predicting their virality before they are posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The proposed startup adapts this concept for YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

The service would allow YouTubers to input potential titles and thumbnails for their videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The system would then predict the likely engagement metrics, such as the number of comments, likes, and subscribers the video would receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

While YouTube currently offers A/B testing for thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, this proposed product would offer a "more deeper" analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, potentially including other factors like video length and its impact on engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## Application and Design

When tested using an [[AI powered startup ideas | AI product designer]] (Poly.ai), the initial concept for the YouTube prediction tool was named "predict," with a tagline emphasizing "AI powered analytics to optimize your YouTube content and maximize your engagement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The tool's features would aim to optimize every aspect of content through A/B testing and engagement prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

The ideal design for such a SaaS product would feature a "glassy, minimalist" interface with "colorful calls to action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, specifically using a "glassmorphism" style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Key elements in the interface would include:
*   Sections for "Version A" (original content) including title, description, and thumbnail inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
*   The ability to predict performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   "AI recommendations" based on analysis, indicating which version is likely to perform better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
*   Visualizations such as a "cumulative engagement chart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
*   Statistical confidence indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   Sections for "recent optimizations" and "AI suggestions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.
*   A title optimizer and performance comparison tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

## Potential and Outlook

The creator believes this idea has significant potential for success, suggesting it could be a multi-million dollar annual business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The product, if implemented effectively, would be highly valuable to YouTubers seeking to maximize their content's reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

The host explicitly states, "I hope someone takes that idea, that's it's gonna work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, highlighting the confidence in the concept's viability.

The creation of validated and resonant startup ideas like this can benefit from iterating with multiple AI tools, such as using [[AI startup ideas and market opportunities | AI product designers]] like Poly.ai and V0, or large language models like Claude and ChatGPT, to refine and visualize the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. This approach leverages the strengths of different platforms to achieve the best possible outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

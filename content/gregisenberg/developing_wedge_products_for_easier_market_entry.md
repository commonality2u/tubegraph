[[gotomarket_strategies_for_vertical_saas | Vertical SaaS]] businesses often employ a strategic approach to market entry and expansion by utilizing "wedge products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. This method contrasts with attempting to build an all-in-one solution from the outset, which can be time-consuming and capital-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

## What is a Wedge Product?
A wedge product is defined as a "get in the door product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>. It serves as an initial offering designed to gain market penetration and establish a reputation with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. The ultimate goal in [[gotomarket_strategies_for_vertical_saas | vertical SaaS]] is often to become the "one-stop shop" or "all-in-one solution" for an industry, serving as the primary "source of record" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>. However, very few companies start with this comprehensive offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.

## Characteristics of an Effective Wedge Product
A successful wedge product typically possesses several key attributes:
*   **Addresses a critical pain point** It targets an area where processes are manual (e.g., "on paper") or current solutions are poor, but the problem is highly important to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **Easy to implement and deploy** It should not require a lengthy implementation period (e.g., not a "12-month implementation") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.
*   **Reputation prover** It demonstrates value quickly and builds trust with the customer, paving the way for future product adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. Many wedge products fail because their strategic role as a "reputation prover" is not adequately considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.
*   **Low friction acquisition** Ideally, it facilitates [[gotomarket_strategies_for_vertical_saas | marketing-led customer acquisition]] rather than relying on heavy sales efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:44]</a>.

## Case Study: Roofer.com
Roofer.com provides a strong example of a successful wedge product strategy in the home services industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   **Industry**: Roofing companies, a large market with a healthy mix of small, mid-market, and enterprise businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:14]</a>.
*   **Wedge Product**: Instead of starting with an all-in-one roofing software, Roofer.com began with a "proposal tool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:30]</a>. This tool utilized Google Maps to provide real-time quotes, simplifying the traditional awkward and manual proposal process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:17]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: The proposal tool was free for roofing companies, and Roofer.com earned a percentage of each booking that occurred through the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:06]</a>.
*   **Acquisition**: This enabled them to acquire roofing companies through [[strategies_for_launching_and_growing_consumer_brands | digital marketing]] (e.g., Instagram, Facebook ads), which is unconventional for home services that typically rely on heavy sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:49]</a>.
*   **Expansion**: After establishing trust and a user base with the proposal tool, Roofer.com then expanded its offerings, launching a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:20]</a>. This demonstrated a progression towards becoming an all-in-one solution by moving down the life cycle of roofing company operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:29]</a>.

## Strategic Implications: Capturing Payments
A key strategic advantage of wedge products is their potential to lead to the capture of transactions, specifically payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:29]</a>. [[building_businesses_with_high_margins | Adding payments]] to a [[gotomarket_strategies_for_vertical_saas | vertical SaaS]] solution is crucial for [[building_businesses_with_high_margins | building massive companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:40]</a>.

For example, Toast, a restaurant software company, significantly increased its market size potential by integrating payment processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:43]</a>. While the software-only market might be limited, taking a percentage of the entire transaction volume (e.g., a trillion dollars in U.S. restaurant revenue) drastically expands the total addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:48:03]</a>.

If a wedge product positions the company before or after the core transaction, it creates an opportunity to eventually own that transaction, leading to substantial scaling opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:21]</a>.

## Pricing Considerations
When pricing a [[productized_services_for_high_ltv_software | product]] in [[gotomarket_strategies_for_vertical_saas | vertical SaaS]], particularly after a wedge product has proven value, it's essential to understand the direct financial impact the solution provides to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:50:11]</a>. Products that demonstrably increase revenue, decrease costs, prevent customer churn, or ensure compliance are easier to price and sell because they offer clear Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:42]</a>.

For instance, a retention tool for trade schools, by saving students who might otherwise drop out, directly translates to significant revenue savings for the school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:26]</a>. If a product saves five students, each paying $20,000 in tuition, it represents substantial value that can justify a higher price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:32]</a>. The pricing model can then be structured as a portion of the value delivered, such as 20% to 50% of the money saved or generated for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:16]</a>.

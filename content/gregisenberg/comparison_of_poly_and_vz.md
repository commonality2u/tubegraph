This article compares [[poly_app_functionality_and_features | Poly]] and [[using_vzer_for_web_development | VZ]], two AI product design tools, based on a first-time user experience with [[poly_app_functionality_and_features | Poly]] and existing familiarity with [[using_vzer_for_web_development | VZ]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The comparison aims to assess their effectiveness in generating production-ready designs and front-end code from natural language prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Poly: AI Product Designer

[[poly_app_functionality_and_features | Poly]] is an AI product designer from a Y Combinator (YC) startup, touted for its ability to produce beautiful designs and production-ready code from simple English descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

### Key Features and User Experience
*   **Prompt-Based Design:** Functions much like ChatGPT but for design, allowing users to write what they want to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45">[02:45]</a>.
*   **Input Methods:** Supports microphone input and image uploads, enabling users to upload hand-drawn wireframes or inspiration images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04">[03:04]</a>.
*   **User Interface:** Autocreates a first project upon signup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26">[02:26]</a>. Offers light and dark mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00">[08:00]</a>. Provides options to edit elements like font, radius, and colors after generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11">[08:11]</a>.
*   **Credit System:** Free users receive 250 credits, with pages costing 50 credits and components 25 credits each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26">[08:26]</a>.
*   **Design Persistence:** Keeps a history of designs on the right-hand side, and includes a rollback button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46">[16:46]</a>.

### Evaluation of Poly's Performance
The user tested [[poly_app_functionality_and_features | Poly]] by attempting to design a YouTube analytics and prediction SaaS product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[04:15]</a>.

*   **Initial Output:** The first attempt generated only a landing page for the product, not the actual functional interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08">[11:08]</a>. Buttons like "Get Started" and "See Demo" were non-functional, leading to a black screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40">[10:40]</a>. The design did not achieve the requested "glassy" aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26">[10:26]</a>.
*   **Generation Time:** Pages can take up to a minute or longer to generate, and the tool lacks a progress bar, making the waiting process less transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01">[09:01]</a>.
*   **Prompt Specificity:** The tool requires precise design terms (e.g., "glass morphism") to yield desired aesthetic results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33">[13:33]</a>. Without explicit design terms, the output may not align with the user's aesthetic taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17">[14:17]</a>.
*   **Iterative Design:** It required multiple prompts to refine the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52">[15:52]</a>. The second attempt yielded a more detailed product interface with relevant elements like analytics charts, although some details (like "Image" format for YouTube) were still inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45">[23:45]</a>.
*   **Strengths:** The generated product interface for the analytics tool was considered "pretty cool" and "helpful," and it included features like a cumulative engagement chart and statistical confidence metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54">[23:54]</a>. It also built out the code, which is seen as a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05">[27:05]</a>.

## VZ: AI Product Designer

[[using_vzer_for_web_development | VZ]] is presented as a well-known product in the AI designer space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36">[00:36]</a>. The user has prior experience with [[using_vzer_for_web_development | VZ]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18">[01:18]</a>.

### Key Features and User Experience
*   **Transparency in Generation:** [[using_vzer_for_web_development | VZ]] provides reasoning and a "thinking" process during generation, which makes the user feel more at ease compared to [[poly_app_functionality_and_features | Poly]]'s "black box" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05">[02:05]</a>.
*   **Interactive Feedback:** Allows users to ask questions and receive feedback on design elements (e.g., whether a design feels "glass-morphic"). The tool will respond and offer to enhance the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42">[24:42]</a>.
*   **Output Quality:** In a comparative test, [[using_vzer_for_web_development | VZ]] also generated a design that was very similar to the provided inspiration image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:23">[22:23]</a>. It built out the product interface, including elements for AB testing YouTube content versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37">[22:37]</a>.
*   **Design Nuances:** It lacked the ability to hover over charts to see specific data points, a feature present in [[poly_app_functionality_and_features | Poly]]'s output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50">[26:50]</a>.
*   **Overall Impression:** Visually, [[using_vzer_for_web_development | VZ]] was perceived as "a little bit nicer" than [[poly_app_functionality_and_features | Poly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17">[27:17]</a>.

## Conclusion and Recommendation

Both [[poly_app_functionality_and_features | Poly]] and [[using_vzer_for_web_development | VZ]] are capable AI product designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:16">[28:16]</a>.

*   **Poly Strengths:** Generates production-ready code, and its final design iteration provided a detailed and helpful product interface with unique hover functionalities on charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54">[23:54]</a>.
*   **VZ Strengths:** Offers more transparency in its generation process, provides interactive feedback, and generally feels more "at ease" to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05">[21:05]</a>.

The speaker's recommendation leans slightly towards [[using_vzer_for_web_development | VZ]] due to its feedback mechanism and slightly nicer visual design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03">[28:03]</a>. However, the rapidly evolving nature of AI tools means that the better product today might be surpassed tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52">[27:52]</a>.

Ultimately, to get the most out of these AI product designers, it's recommended to use a combination of tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:30">[28:30]</a>. Similar to how users might leverage multiple AI tools like ChatGPT or [[comparison_of_chatgpt_pro_and_perplexity_ai_for_startup_development | Perplexity AI]] for different purposes, combining [[poly_app_functionality_and_features | Poly]] and [[using_vzer_for_web_development | VZ]] could yield the best results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:39">[28:39]</a>. This multi-tool approach allows users to capitalize on the specific strengths and nuances of each platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:04">[29:04]</a>.

Traditional wisdom often emphasizes building startups around prevailing trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. However, a less discussed but potentially more advantageous strategy involves focusing on **anti-trends** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This approach can make it easier to carve out a niche in competitive markets like software and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## What are Anti-Trends?
An anti-trend involves positioning a startup directly opposite a popular trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For example, in an era where everyone is talking about AI, an "AI-free" product or service could be a compelling anti-trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This "AI-free" stance could attract significant demand, despite billions being invested in [[aidriven_startups | AI-driven startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Being the first to identify and capitalize on such an [[importance_of_antitrend_positioning | anti-trend positioning]] can create a strong competitive moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

A study suggests that mentioning artificial intelligence in product descriptions can actually lower consumer purchase intent, particularly in the B2C sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This indicates that for some audiences, an "AI-free" approach, especially on a website, might lead to positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This highlights the potential for [[emergence_of_antitrend_business_models | antitrend business models]].

## How to Identify Anti-Trends

Identifying anti-trends often begins with observing the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Several tools can also assist in this process:

### 1. Pinterest Trends
Pinterest provides insights into trending topics, allowing users to see monthly and weekly changes in search popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. By examining what is currently trending, one can consider doing the opposite to identify potential anti-trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. For example, if "Brat Summer" is trending, "Demure Fall" could be its anti-trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Pinterest Trends also shows related trends, which can spark [[startup_ideas_for_entrepreneurs | startup ideas]] around products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### 2. Google Trends
Google Trends allows users to track the search interest of a topic over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. It can reveal if a trend is growing sustainably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. A key feature is "people also search" and, more importantly, "questions" related to the trend, which provides insight into the audience's mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### 3. Glimpse Chrome Extension
Glimpse supercharges Google Trends by adding features like more extensive related trends and data on social media activity (e.g., if a topic is more active on Instagram or Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This can help determine where to build an audience or where competition is lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Glimpse also offers a "Discover Trends" tab to find rising search volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

### 4. Cloe (Cloud)
Cloe, an [[AI startup ideas and incubation | AI-driven]] tool, can identify top creators and websites within a specific niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. This is useful for competitive research and understanding the community surrounding an anti-trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

### 5. Ahrefs
Ahrefs is a powerful SEO tool that can be used to analyze:
*   Website traffic of competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>
*   Low-hanging fruit for SEO and backlinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>
*   Top pages (indicating what content resonates with the audience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>
*   Organic competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>
*   Keyword difficulty and related questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>
*   Geographic search interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>

### 6. View Stats
View Stats, a tool by MrBeast, helps analyze the performance of creators, including subscriber trends, earnings, and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. This helps assess the level of competition and engagement within a niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## Workflow for Anti-Trend Idea Generation
1.  **Identify a prevailing trend:** Start by noting common trends (e.g., hustle culture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
2.  **Define the anti-trend:** Consider the opposite of the trend (e.g., slow living as the antithesis of hustle culture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
3.  **Research with tools:** Use Pinterest Trends, Google Trends, and Glimpse to understand the anti-trend's growth, related topics, and audience questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
4.  **Observe and take notes:** Document observations about the audience's philosophies and principles. For example, for slow living, this might include putting down phones, resting, and connecting with community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
5.  **Brainstorm products/services:** Based on observations, generate [[startup_ideas_and_entrepreneurship_insights | products and services]] that cater to the anti-trend's community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
6.  **Competitive analysis:** Use Cloe, Ahrefs, and View Stats to identify top creators, websites, and competitive landscapes, looking for low-hanging fruit or areas with less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This helps in developing [[strategies_for_startup_success | strategies for startup success]].

For instance, the "slow living" trend has shown progressive, sustainable growth over the past five years globally, making it an attractive area for building businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

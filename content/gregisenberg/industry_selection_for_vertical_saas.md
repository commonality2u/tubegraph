Building a successful vertical SaaS business begins with strategically choosing the right industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This process is less an art and more a scientific, mathematical approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The core principle is to focus on selecting an industry, rather than starting with a software idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Why Vertical SaaS?
Vertical SaaS is not a new concept; software use cases have historically been tied to optimizing businesses, creating efficiency, and generating cost or time savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Over the last 10-15 years, many founders shifted away from industry-specific software to chase broader, multi-billion dollar "unicorn hunting" opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This often led to market constraints and fewer successful outcomes for venture capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

However, significant opportunities remain in "boring" industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, allowing founders to build tailored software that leads to enduring businesses with strong retention rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Key Characteristics for Industry Selection
When evaluating industries, consider the following characteristics:

### Market Size and Segmentation
*   **Revenue Size**: Assess the total revenue generated by companies within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For example, General Medical and Surgical Hospitals in the US generate nearly a trillion dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Number of Companies**: This metric is crucial for understanding market segmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   **Avoid Top-Heavy Industries**: Industries with very few companies (e.g., 2,500 for Surgical Hospitals) are enterprise-driven, requiring extensive features and making sales incredibly difficult, especially for bootstrapped startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   **Ideal Segmentation**: Look for a healthy mix of small businesses (doing a couple million in revenue), mid-market businesses ($10-100 million in revenue), and enterprise businesses (over $100 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Smaller and mid-market businesses are easier to penetrate with a smaller feature set or even a single feature, allowing the company to grow and develop broader capabilities over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### Example: Machine Shops
Machine shops present a promising opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This industry generates $240 billion in revenue and has 22,000 companies, indicating a beautiful segmentation with a healthy mix of small and mid-market businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:10:06]</a>. The average machine shop does $2 million a year in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Understanding the Industry and Its Operations
Even without prior domain expertise, it's possible to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. The key is to engage in rigorous research and learning.

### Mapping the Customer Journey and Operations
Visualize the entire end-to-end operations of businesses within the target industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. This process helps identify where software opportunities exist and their potential size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Example: Restaurants (Toast)**: Toast, a publicly traded vertical SaaS business for restaurants, visualized every aspect of a restaurant's operations in its S1 filing, from the back office to delivery and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Example: Trade Schools (Corsky)**: Similarly, for trade schools, operations can be mapped out from admissions and student training (often in garages with real equipment) to IT, student services, compliance, and job placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:14:02]</a>. This comprehensive mapping helps pinpoint areas ripe for software solutions.

### Analyzing Profit & Loss (P&L) Statements
Obtain and analyze P&L statements from as many businesses in the industry as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Sources**: Look at publicly traded companies' financials or talk to industry-focused bankers who deal with buying and selling businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **Insights**: P&Ls reveal where companies spend money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Identify expenses related to people that could be automated by software, existing software spending, and its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition**: Software solutions should aim to:
    1.  Increase revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>
    2.  Decrease costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>
    3.  Prevent customer churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>
    4.  Maintain compliance (especially in highly regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>

## Competitive Analysis
Beyond general market research, deeply investigate the existing software landscape within the chosen industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
*   **Legacy Providers**: Many industries have decades-old ERPs or all-in-one solutions that are ripe for disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Horizontal Solutions**: Look for instances where businesses are stitching together multiple non-industry-specific software (e.g., generic CRMs, Trello, Asana, spreadsheets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. These industries are "dying for an all-in-one" solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.
*   **Paper Processes**: Surprisingly, many industries still rely on manual, paper-based processes for critical functions like job tracking, inventory, or maintenance logs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. This represents a significant opportunity for digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Industry Research
AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude can act as valuable research assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **Market Data**: AI is effective for gathering high-level information such as market size, revenue, and segmentation details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
*   **Operational Mapping**: AI can generate detailed step-by-step descriptions of an industry's operations (e.g., customer inquiry, order processing, design, machining, quality control for machine shops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **Identifying Opportunities**: Prompt AI to identify:
    *   Areas still run on pen and paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.
    *   Areas not yet leveraging [[role_of_ai_and_payments_in_vertical_saas | AI]] (e.g., predictive maintenance, optimized scheduling, automated quality control) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:12]</a>.
    *   Areas using a "myriad of horizontal solutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

**Crucial Caveat**: While AI can provide initial insights, it's vital to validate this information through real-world observation. Visit businesses, talk to owners, and shadow operations to ensure the online data reflects reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:21]</a>.

## Go-to-Market Strategy
Understanding the distribution model is critical before investing significant time in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>. A great product without users is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
*   **Study Successful Precedents**: Research how existing vertical SaaS companies in the chosen space acquired their first 10, 100, and 1,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:36:15]</a>.
*   **Sales Model**: Be aware that many traditional industries still require heavy outside sales models, which can be slower than product-led or [[marketing_strategies_for_saas_apps | marketing-led customer acquisition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>. Venture capitalists often prefer the latter for faster growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:17]</a>.
*   **Content and Media**: Consider how content creation and media (e.g., industry-specific newsletters, even with humor like "Machine Shop Meme" emails) can build an audience and foster advocacy, eventually leading to software sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:39:42]</a>.

## Wedge Products
A [[importance_of_wedge_products_in_saas | wedge product]] is your "get in the door" offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. The ultimate goal is to become the all-in-one solution for an industry, but no one starts there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.
*   **Characteristics**: Find a critical area that is currently handled poorly (on paper or by bad competitors), but is highly important to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:23]</a>. A wedge product should be easy to implement quickly, serving as a "reputation prover" <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:40]</a>.
*   **Example: Roofer.com**: This company built a proposal tool for roofing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. It used Google Maps for real-time quotes, was free for the roofing company (taking a percentage of the booking), and allowed for digital customer acquisition, which was unheard of in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:43:51]</a>. Once trust was established, they expanded to offer a CRM, and eventually, an all-in-one solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:34]</a>.

## Monetization Potential
A significant [[monetization_potential_through_micro_saas | monetization potential]] in vertical SaaS lies in owning the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:29]</a>.
*   **Payments Integration**: Incorporating [[role_of_ai_and_payments_in_vertical_saas | payments]] into your solution can dramatically increase the addressable market and allow for massive scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:40]</a>. For example, Toast's market size increased from $120 million (software only) to potentially a trillion dollars (with payments, taking a percentage of restaurant transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:48:03]</a>.
*   **Strategic Placement**: If you can build a wedge product that precedes or follows the transaction, you can eventually capture the transaction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:21]</a>.

## Pricing Framework
Pricing should be meticulously considered, often as a function of the value delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:44]</a>.
*   **Cost of the Problem**: Understand how much the problem you are solving costs the customer today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:09]</a>.
*   **Value-Based Pricing**: Price your product based on the tangible return on investment (ROI) it provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:32]</a>. For example, a student retention tool for trade schools could be priced based on the tuition saved from preventing student dropouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:26]</a>.
*   **Percentage of ROI**: Aim to charge a portion of the money you help the customer make or save, typically starting around 50% and adjusting based on market feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:52:22]</a>. Focus only on products that clearly increase revenue, decrease costs, prevent customer churn, or ensure compliance, as these provide clear ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:42]</a>.

This systematic approach to industry selection, combined with a deep understanding of operations, competition, and monetization, forms the foundation for [[building_a_successful_vertical_saas_business | building a successful vertical SaaS business]].

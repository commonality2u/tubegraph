## Why Vibe Marketing is Emerging

The rise of [[vibe_marketing_strategies_and_tools | Vibe Marketing]] is attributed to three converging factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>:
1.  **AI capability:** [[AI Agents in Marketing | AI]] has become proficient enough at marketing tasks to handle execution, a recent development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
2.  **[[Vibe Coding Tools and Automation | Vibe Coding]] accessibility:** [[Vibe coding for creating apps | Vibe Coding tools]] have made automation accessible to non-developers, requiring no coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
3.  **Reduced tool building costs:** The cost of building custom tools has significantly decreased, allowing for personalized software for minimal expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Old World vs. New World Marketing

### The Old World
Traditional marketing involved larger teams with 10 specialists (SEO, copywriters, designers, analytics, media buyers) working in silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. These teams operated through meetings and Slack threads, leading to longer launch times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### The New World
The new era of [[vibe_marketing_strategies_and_tools | Vibe Marketing]] eliminates the need for millions in funding or large teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. It requires only a single smart marketer with good taste, paired with [[AI Agents in Marketing | AI agents]] and workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This setup allows for real-time testing of numerous marketing angles with hundreds of [[AI Agents in Marketing | AI agents]], enabling launches in days instead of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

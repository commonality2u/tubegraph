To acquire customers for a startup without a large social media following or significant ad spend, focusing on strategic partnerships and community engagement can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This approach involves leveraging existing audiences and providing extreme value.

## The Dream 100 Method

The "Dream 100" is a core concept for [[marketing_through_influencer_partnerships | leveraging creators and influencer partnerships for business growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The idea is to identify and connect with people or organizations who already have access to your target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This can be more effective than traditional social media or advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Process for the Dream 100

1.  **Create a List:** Make a spreadsheet (e.g., Google Sheet) of 100 (or even 10-20) individuals or organizations that communicate with your desired audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   **Example (Web Design Agency for Founders):**
        *   A podcast host who speaks to founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
        *   Platforms like Product Hunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
        *   Organizers of local entrepreneur meetups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
    *   Thoroughly research each entry, including their website, social media, and audience size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This research itself can generate many ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
2.  **Strategize Your Approach:** Determine what you can offer to these individuals or organizations that would provide significant value to them, thereby exposing you to their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   **Paid Advertisement:** Directly pay for an ad on their platform (e.g., blog) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
    *   **Collaboration:** Pitch an idea for a collaboration, such as being an occasional podcast host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This can generate significant leads without needing a personal social media presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
    *   **Gifting:** Offer a thoughtful, personalized gift to build rapport and demonstrate your commitment. This can be small and meaningful or a larger, significant gesture depending on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

### The Canvas Strategy for Outreach

When reaching out to busy or influential people, use the "Canvas Strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This method, popularized by Ryan Holiday, focuses on being helpful to "gatekeepers" or those above you in a hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

*   **Offer Value, Don't Just Ask:** Avoid directly asking for favors (e.g., "Can I come on your podcast?") as it can be perceived as insulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Instead, prepare a pitch that clearly outlines the value you bring to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Be Strategic with Funds:** Rather than spending on generic branding or marketing agencies, allocate a budget towards high-leverage collaborations with top "Dream 100" contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.

> "Contacting one of these people gets you more leads or gets you more traffic than doing all of the other stuff like doing all the Social Media stuff and doing all the other things you could be doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>

### Real-World Impact

One business generated "50 to 60 million euro" primarily through these partnership strategies over 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. A single connection, like with Jake Napp (author of "Sprint"), can lead to massive growth, creating entirely new business segments responsible for "tens of millions of dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## Utilizing Groups and Communities

Another powerful strategy is to find where your audience congregates and spend time there, delivering extreme value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

*   **Join Relevant Groups:** Identify and join groups on platforms like School, Discord, Facebook, or even Reddit and Quora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
*   **Provide Value Consistently:**
    *   Spend the first month purely on being the most valuable person, without spamming or directly seeking work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.
    *   Answer questions thoroughly (e.g., on Quora) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
    *   Share free templates or helpful resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   **Engage with Creators:**
    *   Turn on notifications for creators in your niche and be among the first to leave thoughtful, valuable comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. This builds trust with the creator and attracts other engaged users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
    *   Share the creator's content to show genuine support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

## High-Effort, Low-Quality Content

For those uncomfortable with a personal brand or being the "face," create highly valuable, long-form content that isn't focused on an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

*   **Focus on Utility:** Create tutorials that are "ludicrously over-the-top valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.
*   **No Need for High Production:** The content doesn't need to be visually perfect. Low-quality video with high-effort, valuable information is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>. People often listen or watch passively to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.
*   **Address Specific Problems:** Find common questions on platforms like Quora or within communities, then create in-depth videos or tutorials that answer them comprehensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.

### Benefits

These strategies allow new businesses to generate leads and gain momentum quickly, often within a month, without relying on social media influence or paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. They prioritize high-leverage activities over menial tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. While content creation can enhance these efforts by stacking the deck in your favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>, it's not a prerequisite for initial success.

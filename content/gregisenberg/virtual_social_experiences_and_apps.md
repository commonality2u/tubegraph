The concept of [[reinventing_social_networks_with_a_focus_on_privacy_and_nostalgia | reinventing social networks]] and creating new virtual social experiences is a recurring theme in startup ideas from Danny Grant's list of 139 suggestions. These ideas often explore how to make digital interactions more engaging, social, and user-friendly, sometimes integrating elements of existing successful platforms or adapting old formats to new niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

## Virtual Workspace

One idea proposes a "virtual workspace" to compete with platforms like Tandem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. Tandem, which started as an app where users could see teammates in a "third space," pivoted to a combination of Slack and video conferencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>. The suggested idea aims to make existing communication tools like Slack more social <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

### Challenges
*   **Building Primitives:** A significant hurdle is the need to first build the core functionalities that users expect from platforms like Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.
*   **Differentiation:** After establishing basic features, the next challenge is to innovate and create a unique and social experience that stands out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.
*   **User Migration:** Getting users to switch from established platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams is incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

> "This is one of those ideas where I think, you know, they call it a tarpit idea. It's an idea that seems good on paper but like once you actually go and uh go into it it's actually a bad idea because there's so much investment that you need to put into something like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>

## Silent Disco World

Another concept envisions the "whole world as a silent disco," drawing inspiration from Turntable.fm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>. Turntable.fm allowed users to create virtual rooms, play music, chat, and interact with avatars, feeling almost like a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:39">[01:12:39]</a>. The core idea is to create a "network DJ station" where the entire world becomes one large silent disco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>. While the technical implementation might not be overly complex, the major challenge lies in gaining widespread user adoption and navigating the complexities of music licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.

## Social Coding (JSFiddle Meets Twitter)

A technical yet social idea proposes combining JSFiddle with Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>. JSFiddle allows developers to write, compile, and run code online, particularly JavaScript, without needing a local development environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>. Despite its popularity, JSFiddle is not social <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. The proposed idea is to make it "half writing code and half meming and remixing," creating a social space where developers can share, discuss, and remix code snippets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>. This aligns with a pattern in Danny Grant's ideas, which often blend technical functionality with social interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>. Her own app, Jam.dev (for bug tracking), follows a similar social-technical model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.

## "Shopify for X" in Social Apps

The "Shopify for X" concept suggests creating no-code tools tailored for specific product types, similar to how Shopify provides a no-code e-commerce solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>. Applied to social apps, this means building:
*   No-code marketplaces for apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>
*   No-code messaging apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>
*   No-code Instagram-like apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>

This approach addresses the current landscape of no-code tools, which are either too limited or overly complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. While platforms like Bubble are already doing pieces of this, the vision is for a dedicated marketplace where users can easily duplicate and license app ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:49">[01:15:49]</a>. This direction is seen as inevitable for the future of app development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>.

## HQ Trivia for Dating

One of the most compelling [[innovative_dating_app_concepts | innovative dating app concepts]] is "HQ Trivia for dating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>. HQ Trivia, popular in 2018-2019, was a live trivia show with daily push notifications and cash prizes that attracted millions of daily players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>. Although the original HQ Trivia faced internal issues leading to its downfall, the format itself was not the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>.

The prediction is that the HQ Trivia format will be revived and applied to new niches, such as dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.
*   **Format:** A live dating show, similar to HQ Trivia, could be highly engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>.
*   **Execution:** To succeed, it would need a catchy name, an interesting premise, and potentially start in major cities like Los Angeles or New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a>.
*   **Engagement:** The experience should feel like a reality TV show, making users want to know the "characters" involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>.

This idea falls under a broader trend of applying the "HQ Trivia for X" format, which is seen as a promising area for future development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.

## What Are Type Beats?
"Type beats" are a subset of the hip-hop and rap music genre. They are instrumental tracks designed to sound similar to the style of well-known artists, such as a "Kendrick type beat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01]</a>. There are thousands of keyword searches for these types of beats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14]</a>.

## AI in Beat Production
Traditionally, producers might create around 10 type beats in a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54]</a>. However, [[business_opportunities_with_ai_in_video_production | AI models]] for beat production and layering sounds have made the creation process significantly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39]</a>. With AI tools, producers can potentially create thousands of type beats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01]</a>. The outputs from [[using_ai_in_content_creation | AI]] are already decent and are expected to improve further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies
The primary ways to monetize type beats involve licensing and selling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32]</a>.

### YouTube Distribution as a Funnel
A common distribution strategy involves:
*   Registering the type beats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13]</a>.
*   Posting them to YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15]</a>.
*   When users search for a specific type beat, the videos are served up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21]</a>.
*   Producers earn ad revenue and streaming revenue from people listening to the beats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23]</a>.
*   The video description includes a link back to a company or marketplace where users can license or buy the beat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29]</a>.
*   Advertisements on YouTube can also drive traffic to these videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43]</a>.

### Marketplaces
Key marketplaces for selling and licensing type beats include:
*   **typebeats.com** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13]</a>
*   **BeatStars** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23]</a>
    *   Top type beat producers on BeatStars can earn up to $60,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33]</a>.
    *   Leases for type beats typically cost between $15 and $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35]</a>.

### Licensing Structure
The typical economic structure for licensing a beat involves:
*   A license for a set period, e.g., one year for $29, which grants exclusive use during that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16]</a>.
*   The option to buy full rights to a beat at a higher price, e.g., $295 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26]</a>.
*   Many artists buy a batch of beats (e.g., 10) to create multiple tracks, playing a numbers game in the music industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34]</a>.

### Additional Revenue Streams
*   **YouTube Ad Revenue:** Significant income can be generated from YouTube ad revenue, especially for channels with many subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40]</a>.
*   **Streaming Revenue:** Earning revenue from plays on streaming platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Marketing:** This business model is also well-suited for [[strategies_for_monetizing_content_with_ai | affiliate marketing]], where producers can earn recurring revenue by including affiliate links for software as a service (SaaS) products used in their workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47]</a>.

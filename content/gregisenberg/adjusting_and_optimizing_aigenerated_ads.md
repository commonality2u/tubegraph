Creating advertisements with [[use_of_ai_tools_in_ad_creation | AI tools]] can significantly increase return on ad spend (ROAS) and lead to a more profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The key lies in mastering the skills to prompt large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT 4o to generate winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This approach allows for rapid experimentation and scaling of ad creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, which is crucial for identifying what resonates with different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Prompting with ChatGPT 4o

Unlike pure image models such as Midjourney or Ideogram, ChatGPT 4o is a multimodal language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This means that direct and straightforward prompting is often more effective, as the model has a strong understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### The Role of Inspiration and Product Images
For effective ad creation, providing inspiration images and product images is more crucial than complex prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

*   **For New or Small Products**: Always provide a reference image if your product is relatively new, small, or lacks significant online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **For Well-Known Brands**: If the product or brand is well-known (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge wallets), ChatGPT 4o has a strong understanding of these concepts and may not require a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### General Prompting Advice
*   **Clarity and Directness**: Be very clear and direct in what you want from the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **New Chat for Adjustments**: If the initial prompt doesn't yield the desired results, start a new chat for adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to a degradation of image quality because the model uses the previous (AI-generated) image as a reference, inheriting its flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **"Generate the image"**: Include "generate the image" at the end of your prompt to ensure image results, preventing the AI from generating text descriptions of the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Keywords for Realism**: Use keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to ensure high-quality, non-cartoonish images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Font Types**: For well-known fonts, the model has a decent understanding and can represent them if specified (e.g., "font type exo2 bold italic") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratios**: You can specify desired aspect ratios (e.g., 1:1, 9:16) in the prompt, though it often defaults to 9:6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Examples of AI-Generated Ads

### 1. Using Inspiration and Product Images
A common approach is to provide an inspiration ad and your own product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Prompt Example**: "Add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Benefit**: This method allows for creating super consistent and reliable ads by making simple edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Optimization**: Generate variations with different characters (men, women, old, young, diverse colors) to see what converts best for different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. ChatGPT 4o excels at creating photorealistic images of various audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This capability enables [[optimizing_ad_performance_with_ai | optimizing ad performance with AI]] by allowing ad creatives to become the targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### 2. Creating Ads Without Reference Images
For well-known brands, reference images may not be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The model's existing knowledge of concepts like "Adidas" or "Nike" allows for highly creative outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Prompt Example**: A detailed description of the desired image, including elements like "female runner," "Egyptian desert with pyramids," and specific font types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Result**: AI can generate highly creative and previously impossible ad concepts, such as a runner in an Adidas shape with pyramids in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### 3. Recreating and Adjusting Existing Ads
AI can take an existing ad, incorporate a new product image, and make specific changes like pricing or background style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Prompt Example**: "Recreate this ad for AG1, adjust the background to better fit athletic green style, change the price to $110 / out to $85 now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Industry Practice**: This practice of remixing or templating existing successful ads is already common in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. AI simply makes it more accessible and automates the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### 4. Changing the Concept of an Existing Ad
AI can be used to dramatically alter the theme of an existing ad, such as changing a Black Friday ad to a Christmas-themed one while swapping the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Prompt Example**: "Swap it out and change it to a Christmas style ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Seasonal and Niche Targeting**: This capability allows for creating targeted ads for major holidays (Christmas, New Year's) or even niche events (National Hot Dog Day) and personalized ads (e.g., "Happy Birthday, 30% off") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. This is an example of [[applications_of_ai_in_marketing_and_growth_strategies | applications of AI in marketing and growth strategies]].

### 5. Leveraging New Cycle Moments
Companies can now rapidly create ads that capitalize on current events or news cycles, which was previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **Example**: An ad referencing a specific news controversy for a company like Rippling, using clever, funny copy in a vintage newspaper style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
*   **Future Potential**: [[use_of_ai_agents_in_marketing_strategies | AI agents]] could potentially monitor news feeds and generate these ads on mass automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## Sources for Ad Inspiration

To find inspiration and templates for ads, consider these tools:
*   **Creative OS**: Offers inspiration and templating tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **ForPlay** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   **Icon.me**: A recently launched tool that integrates with Meta's ad library, tagging and making ads searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   **Sora Explore Page**: A good source for understanding how effective prompts are structured and for ideation, as it displays the prompt used for each image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Live Ad Creation Example: LCA

When creating an ad for a new company like LCA (Late Checkout Agency), which focuses on designing AI interfaces for top brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>:

1.  **Gather Assets**: Screenshot relevant elements from the company's website, such as logos, typography, brand colors, and client lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
2.  **Choose Inspiration**: Select an inspiration ad that aligns with the desired brand vibe (e.g., a vintage Rolex ad for a luxury feel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.
3.  **Initial Prompting**:
    *   Provide clear instructions and context about the company and its services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
    *   Explicitly mention the provided screenshots and the reference ad, indicating their purpose (e.g., to capture a "luxury vibe") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
    *   Be aware that if a brand is not well-known, the AI relies more on its own creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.
4.  **Iterative Refinement**:
    *   **One-shot vs. Iteration**: While some simple ads may be generated on the first try, more complex or novel concepts usually require two to three iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
    *   **New Chat for Edits**: As mentioned, start a new chat for each significant adjustment to avoid image degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.
    *   **Specific Adjustments**: Clearly prompt for what needs to be replaced or modified (e.g., "rather than generating a watch, show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.
    *   **Consistency**: The "temperature" of LLMs is generally low, meaning similar prompts tend to produce similar results, allowing for consistent adjustments without completely changing the core image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.

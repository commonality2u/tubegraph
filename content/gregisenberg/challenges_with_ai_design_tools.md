AI design tools, while promising, present several challenges that users may encounter when attempting to generate desired outputs. The experience with platforms like Poly and V0 highlights common hurdles, from output quality to user interaction and the need for specific prompting.

## Poly.ai Challenges

Poly.ai, initially touted as an AI product designer capable of translating English prompts into "beautiful designs" and "production ready code," faced several functional and design-related issues during a live demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Key challenges include:
*   **Design Discrepancies** Poly.ai struggled to produce designs that fully adhered to specific aesthetic requests, such as a "glassy minimalist" look, initially failing to achieve a "glass morphism" aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
*   **Lack of Functional Interactivity** Generated designs often lacked expected interactive elements. Buttons like "Get Started" would lead to a black screen, and "See Demo" would not showcase an actual clickable product interface, but rather static images or a blank page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   **Irrelevant Product Images** The product images or dashboards generated were often generic and irrelevant to the specific use case (e.g., general website analytics dashboards for a YouTube-specific tool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
*   **Slow Generation & No Progress Bar** The generation process for designs could be slow, taking minutes, without a progress bar to indicate status, leading to user uncertainty and frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **"Black Box" Operation** Poly.ai operates as a "black box" without providing feedback or reasoning for its design choices, making it difficult for users to understand why a certain output was generated or how to refine their prompts effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **Credit-Based System** The use of a credit system for generations can obscure the actual cost of using the tool, making it less transparent than a direct monetary charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Requirement for Multiple Prompts** Achieving a more satisfactory design often required multiple, iterative prompts, indicating that the initial output might not meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

Despite these issues, Poly.ai did manage to create some visually appealing elements and detailed conceptual dashboards, even if the core functionality was lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

## V0 Challenges

V0 generally offers a more refined experience compared to Poly.ai, particularly in its communication with the user. However, it still faces some limitations:
*   **Literal Interpretation of Images** V0 tends to literally copy design elements from provided images, which can be both a strength and a weakness, as it might not innovate or adapt the design beyond the exact reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
*   **Limited Interactivity in Rendered Designs** While V0 designs are often visually appealing, they may lack specific interactive features, such as hover effects on charts, which were present in Poly.ai's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

V0's ability to provide reasoning behind its design choices and engage in a dialogue about design modifications (e.g., explaining why a design isn't fully "glass morphic" and how it plans to enhance it) makes it more user-friendly and predictable than Poly.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

## General Challenges in [[Benefits and challenges of integrating AI in software development | Integrating AI in Software Development]]

*   **[[importance_of_foundational_web_design_knowledge_when_using_ai_tools | Importance of Foundational Web Design Knowledge when using AI tools]]**: A significant challenge is that users need a foundational understanding of design terms and current trends (e.g., "glass morphism") to craft effective prompts and get the most out of AI design tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Without this specific vocabulary, the AI may not understand the desired aesthetic, leading to unsatisfactory results.
*   **High User Expectations**: The rapid advancement of AI has set a very high bar for output quality. Users now expect "incredible" results to integrate AI products into their daily workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
*   **Refinement and Iteration**: Even with advanced tools, achieving the perfect design often requires iterative prompting and refinement, similar to how a human designer would work, but perhaps with different methods of feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Combining Tools**: To [[maximizing_output_from_ai_tools | maximize output from AI tools]] and overcome individual tool limitations, users may need to employ multiple AI design tools (e.g., using V0 for initial design and Poly.ai for specific code generation or visual elements), similar to how one might use different AI models for writing or research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.

Overall, while AI design tools show significant [[potential_of_ai_in_product_design | potential of AI in product design]], they are still evolving. Users must adapt their approach, including learning specialized terminology and potentially integrating multiple tools, to navigate current challenges and achieve desired outcomes.

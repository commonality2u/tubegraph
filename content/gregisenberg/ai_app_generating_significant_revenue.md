The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new avenues for entrepreneurs, with some AI applications generating significant revenue within a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>. These ventures often leverage existing AI models, like ChatGPT, and focus on niche markets with strong branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:11">[04:07:11]</a>.

## The Riz App and Plug AI Phenomenon

A notable example is the "Riz app," an [[ai_driven_mobile_app_startup_ideas | AI dating coach]] built on ChatGPT, which was reported to be making $190,000 per month with 333,000 downloads monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>. The idea for this app originated from a Tinder subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:17">[02:15:17]</a>.

It was later clarified that the app making $190,000 MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) was actually "Plug AI," a texting assistant that helps users generate pickup lines from screenshots of text messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:27">[08:39:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:04">[08:42:04]</a>. "Riz AI" is a competitor and also a top AI dating assistant app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>. This highlights the intense competition in the AI app market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>.

## The Founder's Success Story

The 23-year-old co-founder of the company "AI Riz," which launched Plug AI, leads a small three-person development studio that is actively hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:24">[05:21:24]</a>. This studio is reportedly closing in on $500,000 in monthly revenue across three apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

The three apps developed by AI Riz are:
*   **Plug AI** (texting assistant/dating coach) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:27">[08:39:27]</a>
*   **Astra** (life advice coach, focusing on compatibility, personal growth, and dreams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>
*   **Pallet** (AI-powered color season determination, personalized style, and makeup suggestions based on a selfie) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>

The success of these apps is attributed to brilliant strategies:
*   **Leveraging Existing Technology:** They do not build extensive new technology but rather utilize what is already available, such as ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.
*   **Strong Branding and Positioning:** They come up with catchy names and focused positioning for their apps, targeting specific [[ai_applications_for_niche_markets | niche markets]] (e.g., dating coaching, style advice) instead of trying to be an app for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

## Profitability and Sustainability

While "Plug AI" generates $190,000/month, the founder's company as a whole is approaching $500,000/month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. After Apple's 33% cut, the profit margin is estimated to be around 65% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

Concerns about the sustainability of such [[ai_app_development_process | AI-driven mobile app startup ideas]] often arise due to reliance on underlying platforms like OpenAI, which could change their [[pricing_models_for_ai_apps | API Usage in AI App Development]] or policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>. However, the founder's strategy of launching multiple apps in different verticals (diversification) mitigates this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>. Even if one app falters, others can sustain the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>. The skills acquired in running these businesses are also transferable to future ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.

## Philosophy of Financial Stability

There is a perspective that achieving personal financial stability, sometimes referred to as one's "first nut" or base capital, is a crucial step before attempting to "change the world" on a larger scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>. Businesses like these AI apps, even if deemed "flash in the pan" by some, allow founders to gain significant capital, retire parents, support causes, or buy a first home, thus achieving financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>. This practical approach to business is often overlooked in discussions focused solely on grand visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:33:00">[25:33:00]</a>.

## Anti-Trend Opportunities

For every trend, there is an anti-trend, and some of the most interesting [[ai_startup_opportunities | startup ideas]] emerge from these counter-movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>. While AI apps are booming, there is an emerging demand for human-centric services that mirror AI offerings. For instance, a human dating coach or stylist could leverage the same marketing power and positioning as an AI app, but offer a premium, human-led experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>.

This human-centric approach could allow for higher pricing and face less competition compared to the crowded AI assistant market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. For example, the founder of Plug AI could offer a premium upgrade where a human provides the dating advice, serving as a "stranger entry point" into a coaching program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. This highlights [[examples_of_profitable_ai_app_business_models | AI app development process]] often inspiring non-AI ventures.

When considering building a GPT wrapper or similar AI app, focusing on non-obvious use cases is recommended, as obvious ones (like dating or therapy, exemplified by `therapistai.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a> and [[dr_ai_app_concept_and_features | Dr AI app concept and features]]) are already saturated with competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.

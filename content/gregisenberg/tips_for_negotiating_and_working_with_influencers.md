David Park, founder of the AI startup Jenny AI, scaled his company from zero to $10 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) using various growth tactics, including [[influencer_marketing_and_outreach_tactics | influencer marketing]] and user-generated content (UGC) campaigns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> His approach emphasizes strategic engagement and a scientific, iterative method to content creation.

## Organic Short-Form Content: A Foundation for Influencer Collaboration

In the current social media landscape, follower count is less important than content virality. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> A new account with one or ten followers can go just as viral as an account with a million followers if the content resonates. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>

### Sponsoring "Fresh Accounts"

It is often more advantageous to sponsor a new account created recently, even if they have low follower counts, compared to established YouTubers with millions of subscribers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>

*   **Cost-Effectiveness**: New accounts typically charge significantly less (e.g., 1/100th the price) because they are often excited to be paid for what they might otherwise do for free. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   **Algorithm Boost**: A fresh account that is getting views likely has the algorithm boosting their content, indicating current relevance and resonance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
*   **Engagement**: Established creators might be past their peak, relying on momentum or a declining trend, whereas new accounts are on an uptrend. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>

### Creating Your Own Accounts

Instead of solely finding and sponsoring existing accounts, consider creating new accounts yourself and having a creator act as the "face" of your product. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>

*   **Case Study: Mang Mang Duck**: Jenny AI partnered with Mang Mang Duck, paying him $4,000 per month for 20 videos. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> This collaboration, starting with a zero-follower account, generated 7 million impressions in the first month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a> and eventually grew to 70,000 followers with half a billion views across platforms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>
    *   The creator was already teaching about writing, which aligned well with Jenny AI's product. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>
    *   Many creators with large followings (e.g., 300,000 on TikTok) might not be monetizing effectively and could be open to such deals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>
    *   Payment commitments can be short-term (e.g., three months), allowing for testing the channel's effectiveness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>
    *   Videos can be low-effort for the creator (5-10 minutes a day) by supplying them with screen grabs and product videos, requiring only a new hook from them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>

### The Viral Series Strategy

The ultimate goal when working with a creator is to find a viral video series format that can be replicated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>

*   **Replication, Not Reinvention**: People are creatures of habit and enjoy seeing similar content repeatedly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a> Once a video goes viral, the challenge is to adapt it into a series, continuously re-posting variations to maximize its upside. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>
*   **Format Product Fit**: Ensure the viral format naturally integrates with your product. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>
    *   Going viral for the sake of it is "empty calories" and won't lead to conversions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>
    *   Example: Jenny AI's "POV: You have a paper or an essay due" series, which generated over 300 million views and half a million dollars in revenue, effectively integrated the product into a relatable scenario. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>
*   **Iteration and Volume**: Post frequently (e.g., one or more videos per day) to test different hooks, content angles, skits, memes, or educational content. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a> This "shots on goal" approach increases the likelihood of finding a "mega banger" video that gets millions of views. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>
*   **Scaling the Virality Cycle**:
    1.  **Farm multiple accounts**: Instead of one account per platform, create many (e.g., Jenny AI had seven accounts on each platform, totaling 24 accounts posting daily). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>
    2.  **Experiment**: Test various hooks and ideas, observing what competitors are doing and what's gaining attention in other industries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>
    3.  **Find a viral video**: After enough experimentation, a video will go viral. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>
    4.  **Create a series**: Turn the viral video into a repeatable series. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>
    5.  **Translate for new markets**: Create similar videos with creators who speak other languages (e.g., Mandarin), as these can perform very well. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>
    6.  **Sponsor reposts**: Pay other pages (e.g., meme pages on Instagram) to repost your viral content for a second life. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>
    7.  **Use for paid ads**: Leverage mega-viral content for paid advertising campaigns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>
    8.  **Adapt**: Eventually, copycats will emerge, and the series will become played out, requiring you to return to step one to find new hooks and ideas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>

## Finding Influencers

The most effective way to find relevant influencers is to understand who your users follow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>

*   **Ask Users Directly**: During user interviews, ask for their social media handles or inquire about influencers they follow related to your product's niche. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a> This provides unbiased information about who truly influences them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>
*   **Leverage Platform Features**:
    *   On platforms like Instagram, click on an influencer's profile and use the "suggest similar accounts" feature. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>
    *   Create a new Instagram or TikTok account, manually follow your initial list of influencers, and watch their videos all the way through. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a> The algorithm will then start showing you other similar influencers in your "For You Page." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>
        *   This strategy helps you find "crazy deals" with emerging creators who have amazing content but low follower counts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>
        *   Sponsoring creators who appear on your "For You Page" when you're not following them indicates their content has the capacity to be pushed to larger, non-follower audiences, increasing your upside. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>

## Reaching Out to Influencers

When reaching out, utilize all available communication channels and focus on personalization. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>

*   **Multi-Channel Approach**: Use DMs, emails, LinkedIn, or even obscure platforms like old blogs if you can find them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a> Finding less common contact methods can make your message stand out. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>
*   **Personalization and Conciseness**:
    *   Messages should be detailed and tailored, demonstrating you are a genuine fan of their content. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>
    *   Explain why they should partner with you and why their audience would love your product. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>
    *   Avoid irrelevant details about your company, such as funding rounds or number of employees. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>
    *   Be concise; no one reads long paragraphs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>
*   **Clearly State "Paid Promotion"**: Influencers are constantly offered free products or subscriptions. Make it clear upfront that this is a paid promotion to be taken seriously. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>
*   **Expect Low Response Rates**: Assume most messages won't receive a response, especially early on. Develop "tougher skin" and focus on optimizing your outreach rather than being discouraged. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a> As your product gains recognition, it becomes easier to secure partnerships. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>

## Negotiating with Influencers

Align incentives to ensure both parties want a high-converting video. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>

*   **Avoid Upfront Payment**: Do not pay all the money upfront, as it diminishes your leverage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>
*   **Performance-Based Pay**: Structure payments to include a percentage based on conversions (using personal coupon codes) or view counts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>
*   **Transparency**: Be straightforward about your budget and expected ROI. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a> Request their demographics and past sponsored video performance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>
*   **Negotiate Down from Top-Tier Pricing**: Inquire about the price for the most comprehensive package (e.g., link in bio, Instagram story, posts on all short-form accounts, full usage rights, complete product focus). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a> Then, remove elements you don't need to get to a fairer price. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a> Finally, propose a bulk deal (e.g., three videos per month) for a further discount. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>
*   **Ignore Follower-Based Pricing**: Disregard common advice to pay based on follower count; it's often misinformation that leads to overpaying and poor ROI. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>

## Posting Content and Scaling

Maintain consistency and trust the influencer's creative expertise within your guidelines. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>

*   **Adapt to Influencer Style**: Content should align closely with the influencer's existing style so it doesn't deviate too far and alienate their audience, which would negatively impact retention and conversion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>
*   **Trust the Influencer's "Cook"**: If inexperienced, trust the influencer to create content similar to their usual posts, providing guidance on when and how your product should be featured. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>
*   **Integrate into Existing Series**: Ideally, your product can be inserted into an influencer's popular existing series (e.g., "Top 10 AI tools"). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>
*   **Scale and Automate**: Aim to have videos going out every few hours. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a> To do this without micromanaging, provide influencers with a clear blueprint of expectations (how the product should be spoken about, minimum portrayal time, preferred video types, expected engagement/views) and set up package deals so they can "set and forget" and "cook" on their own. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a> This lean approach allows a small team (e.g., two people managing spending hundreds of thousands per month) to handle large volumes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>
*   **Don't Fear a "Straight-Up Ad"**: While organic views might be lower, a blatant ad that clearly addresses a pain point will convert better because the target audience will remember it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a> Subtle ads are easily missed in the noise of social media. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>

## Final Tips for Success

*   **Balance Art and Science**: Influencer marketing requires both creative understanding of content and rigorous data tracking, campaign management, and organizational skills. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>
*   **Build Relationships**: Develop genuine human-to-human relationships with creators, as this helps break through the noise. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>
*   **Find Common Ground**: Leverage any advantage or common ground you might have with a creator (e.g., shared background, neighborhood) to increase your chances of a response and partnership. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>

The traditional marketing funnel is an outdated and deceptive way to understand modern marketing [00:00:07]. Instead, the concept of [[digital_gravity_and_growth_strategies | digital gravity]] proposes a new framework for building brands and companies [00:00:21].

## Understanding Digital Gravity

[[digital_gravity_and_growth_strategies | Digital gravity]] posits that building a brand or company involves accumulating "digital mass" on the internet [00:02:03]. The more digital mass a brand has, the greater its influence within its specific niche or sphere [00:02:09]. This mass is primarily built through consistent content creation and pervasive marketing efforts wherever the target customer is present [00:02:14].

Traditional marketing funnels suggest a linear path where people enter and exit, buying a product at the end [00:01:12]. However, real purchasing behavior is more cyclical: customers interact with a brand, disengage, get "sucked back in," rotate around it multiple times, and then finally make a purchase [00:01:22]. The funnel model fails to account for customers leaving and returning [00:04:15].

## Building Digital Mass

The analogy used to describe [[digital_gravity_and_growth_strategies | digital gravity]] is that of a comet (customer) flying by a small spec (new company) with no influence [00:03:18]. As the company grows and builds more mass, it exerts greater influence, drawing more people into its orbit who then eventually "touch down," leading to revenue [00:03:30]. This generates a growth flywheel, where revenue is reinvested to build even more mass [00:03:49].

### Continuous Marketing vs. Campaigns
Unlike traditional "campaigns" which originate from military terminology and imply a start and stop [00:05:32], modern marketing is continuous [00:06:01]. This means constantly creating content that adds mass to the company [00:06:13], continuously running ads, and testing to find the cheapest cost-per-click (CPC) for maximum impact [00:06:23]. A website or app, like marketing, should be viewed as a living, breathing entity that is never truly "done" once published [00:06:41].

## B2B Digital Gravity Playbook
For B2B companies, with typically smaller target audiences (e.g., 50,000 people) [00:10:04], the strategy focuses on pervasive presence and value delivery.

### 1. Target Audience Identification & Paid Ads
*   **Email Scraping**: Identify and scrape emails of the target audience using tools like Apollo.io or even LinkedIn [00:10:08].
*   **Custom Match Lists**: Import these emails into platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads to create custom match lists [00:10:53]. Typically, 30-40% of emails might match on platforms like Facebook Ads [00:11:03].
*   **Always-On Ads**: Run ads indefinitely in the background [00:11:16].
*   **UGC AI Avatar Ads**: Utilize [[using_ai_and_technology_in_marketing | AI]] tools like HeyGen for avatars and ElevenLabs for voice to create user-generated content (UGC)-style ads [00:11:20].
    *   The founder can create a [[using_ai_and_technology_in_marketing | digital clone]] of themselves to build fame within the target audience [00:11:31].
    *   Create hundreds of variations with different hooks, settings, backgrounds, and pain points [00:11:53].
    *   Allocate 80% of the ad budget to the best-performing ads (lowest CPC), while 20% remains for continuous testing (Alpha Beta campaign structure) [00:12:11].
    *   Founder-led ads create a story and leverage the idea that people buy from people, not just brands [00:13:48].

### 2. Cold Email Strategy
*   **Tools**: Use services like Mail Reef (for specialized AWS servers for cold email) [00:14:38] and Smartlead or Instantly [[using_ai_and_technology_in_marketing | AI]] for sending [00:14:56].
*   **Domain Isolation**: Maintain separate domains for transactional emails (from product's core domain), newsletter/marketing emails (its own domain), and cold emails (separate domains) [00:15:21]. This prevents the core domain from being flagged as spam [00:15:52].
*   **Messaging**: Emails should align with ads, using a problem-solution orientation [00:17:13].
*   **Rationale**: Cold emailing works, especially when targeting a specific problem and providing value [00:18:28]. It's about persistence; founders shouldn't fear "burning" an audience that likely doesn't care yet [00:18:09].

### 3. Content and Media Business
*   **Podcast Creation**: Record customer conversations to understand pain points, formalize them into a podcast [00:21:45].
*   **Newsletter Distribution**: Sequence the scraped email list to send out weekly podcast episodes with a summary and key takeaways [00:22:08]. MailerLite, Beehiive, and Substack are tools for this [00:22:35].
*   **Leverage as Media Company**: Building a media arm creates leverage, turning marketing from a cost center into a profit center [00:23:11].
    *   *Example (Rupa Health)*: A podcast gained 180,000 downloads/month, becoming a top medical podcast, which was then used to negotiate better deals with lab companies and sell ad placements to subsidize growth costs [00:23:23].
*   **Content Repurposing**: Use [[using_ai_and_technology_in_marketing | AI]] tools like Swell AI to transcribe podcasts, create clips, show notes, blog posts, and white papers from long-form content [00:27:52].
*   **Social Media Presence**: Schedule repurposed content daily across all platforms (LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.) to grow media accounts organically [00:28:40].
    *   *Instagram Strategy*: Run Instagram-only ads for impressions with a call to action in the caption to "follow this account for more content like this" [00:29:22]. This can yield followers at very low costs (e.g., 30 cents a piece) [00:29:57].
    *   The goal is to get free impressions by having large accounts [00:30:23] and creating ads that feel like native content [00:30:46].
*   **Overall Impact**: Within 12 months, this combined strategy leads to massive ad remarketing, a large engaged email list, a popular podcast generating revenue and negotiation power, and strong social media presence, establishing the company as a known entity [00:31:18].

### 4. B2B Case Studies
*   **Rupa Health**: Grew CEO's Instagram and company account using targeted ads to healthtech investors, leading to inbound investment inquiries [00:13:18].
*   **Aero Electronics**: A $6 billion market cap company that owns virtually every electronics blog and magazine, using its media arm to drive its core business of reselling electronics components [00:26:16].
*   **Red Bull**: Functions as a media company that sells energy drinks [00:26:47].
*   **Y Combinator**: A venture capital firm that operates as a media company, doubling down on YouTube content to attract founders [00:26:54].

### 5. Benefits of a Media Business in B2B
*   **Customer Acquisition**: An [[blog_and_newsletter_business_models | email newsletter]] can drive significant, cost-effective traffic (e.g., 80,000 clicks/month for $450, compared to $500,000 via paid clicks) [00:32:44].
*   **Trust and Inbound Leads**: Long-form content, like podcasts, builds deep trust with the audience, leading to high-value inbound leads who are already convinced of the brand's expertise [00:35:18].
*   **Mental Real Estate**: By consistently providing value and expertise, a company owns "mental real estate" in the audience's mind for specific categories or problems [00:36:48]. This makes it difficult for competitors to dislodge them [00:36:53].

## B2C Digital Gravity Playbook
Consumer marketing is highly competitive [00:39:13] and requires an "unbelievable" approach [00:39:07], but winning in this space can be extremely rewarding [00:39:19].

### 1. Market & Product Strategy
*   **Huge Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: Consumer products require a large TAM to create broad enough content for a wide audience [00:39:57].
*   **Focus on Application**: Build an application that people truly want, focusing on a single function done exceptionally well [00:41:07].
*   **Pricing for Impulse Purchase**: A price point like $7.99/week (translating to $29/month) can facilitate impulse purchases, leading to significant revenue over a short period [00:41:34].

### 2. Paid Advertising & Content
*   **Primary Ad Channels**: Facebook Ads and TikTok Ads are crucial [00:42:04].
*   **Conversion Events**: Optimize for deep links leading to app installs and in-app actions (e.g., signup or paid action) [00:42:09].
*   **UGC Creators/Influencers**: Hire 5-10 UGC creators for about $1,000/month to produce daily videos that cross-post across platforms [00:42:44]. These creators act as a testbed for viral content related to the product [00:42:55].
    *   Content often follows a hook-pain point-product as hero structure [00:43:05]. The goal is to make ads feel like valuable or entertaining content [00:43:15].
*   **TikTok Account Strategy**: Spin up 10 different TikTok accounts to create and remix variations of best-performing UGC content [00:43:42]. Use [[using_ai_and_technology_in_marketing | AI]] tools like ChatGPT for scripts, HeyGen for videos, and ElevenLabs for audio [00:43:55]. CapCut can be used for green screen removal to place the app behind the AI avatar [00:44:02].
*   **Website Pixeling**: Pixel every visitor to the website (using Facebook, TikTok, Google pixels) [00:44:39]. This allows for indefinite remarketing, drawing users back into the brand's orbit [00:45:01].
*   **Email Nurture**: Capture emails on the website and layer on an [[blog_and_newsletter_business_models | email nurture]] sequence to upsell the product [00:45:52].

### 3. Influencer Outreach & Affiliate Play
*   **Large-Scale Outreach**: Scrape emails of YouTube creators/influencers in the product's category [00:46:20]. Tools can automatically extract emails from YouTube bios [00:46:35].
*   **Cold Outreach**: Contact creators to inquire about their pricing for sponsored content [00:46:59].
*   **Arbitrage**: Analyze average views versus proposed costs to find pricing discrepancies in the "imperfect market" of influencer rates [00:47:20].
*   **Deal Structure**: Typically, a three-video package (e.g., $1,500) is effective as it builds trust with the audience [00:47:38]. Supplement with an affiliate commission (e.g., 30% recurring) to create stickiness and a "moat" against competitors [00:47:52].
*   **Cross-Platform Application**: This same strategy can be applied to Instagram (using tools like IGleads.io to scrape emails from hashtags/keywords) and TikTok [00:48:46].
*   **CPM Advantage**: Working directly with creators often yields a significantly lower CPM (cost per mille/thousand views) compared to buying ads directly on platforms (e.g., $5 CPM vs. $10 on TikTok) [00:49:33].

### 4. Programmatic SEO
*   **Strategy**: For products with many related long-tail keywords, implement programmatic SEO [00:50:11].
    *   **Domain Authority (DA)**: As the app gains trust and backlinks from other websites, its DA increases [00:50:30]. Once a DA of 40+ is reached, it becomes easier to rank for lower difficulty keywords [00:51:14].
    *   **Content Generation**: Scrape top-ranking content for target keywords [00:51:29], use [[using_ai_and_technology_in_marketing | AI]] tools (like ChatGPT) to create blog post outlines and write content section by section for quality and readability [00:51:38].
    *   **Publishing at Scale**: Publish thousands of articles (e.g., 10,000) [00:52:20].
    *   **Human Refinement**: Once a page gets traffic (even one session), a human SEO or content specialist refines the content to ensure it ranks well for Google and resonates with human readers [00:52:48].
    *   **Calls to Action**: Include calls to action (CTAs) to sign up for the app after the first paragraph, within every scroll frame, and as a full-screen pop-up at 25-50% scroll rate [00:53:29].
    *   **Integration with Pixeling**: Landing on these SEO pages pixels users, feeding them into the remarketing funnel [00:54:01].

### 5. B2C Case Studies
*   **Women's Health App**: Targeted a large TAM (1 in 3 women have the problem), achieving ebook downloads at 40 cents [00:40:13]. The [[creating_and_selling_digital_products | ebook]] itself can be created using [[using_ai_and_technology_in_marketing | AI]] [00:40:39].
*   **Cal AI & Rizz GPT**: These apps achieve millions in monthly recurring revenue with a $5 CPM for user acquisition [00:49:33].
*   **Sunflower Sober (Sober Tracking App)**: Leveraged [[using_ai_and_technology_in_marketing | AI]] within the app (an AI sponsor) for unbelievable engagement, with acquisition primarily through Facebook ads [00:54:26].

Despite the current obsession with short-form social media, significant opportunities still exist in traditional ad channels for those who can identify what audiences are looking for [00:55:06].

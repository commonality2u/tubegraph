[[Influencer marketing tactics for growth | Influencer marketing]] is a key strategy for app growth, particularly for products like Cal AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. When developing a go-to-market strategy for a new application, especially one leveraging AI, understanding and implementing effective [[influencer_marketing_tactics_for_growth | influencer marketing]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

## Designing for Influencer Marketing

When an influencer showcases an app, several design considerations come into play to ensure maximum impact and clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>:
*   **Visual Appeal** Ensure the app looks appealing enough to capture attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Simplicity** The app's value proposition must be immediately understandable to the viewer, especially given that a phone screen might only be visible for two seconds in an influencer video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.
*   **Digestibility** Gamified and digestible elements benefit not only the user experience but also the effectiveness of [[influencer_marketing_tactics_for_growth | influencer marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.
*   **Branding Placement** Place the app's name prominently on the homepage and on key screens, such as the scanning screen, which are likely to be featured most by influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   **"Wow Factor" Feature** Identify and emphasize the most compelling feature of the app that will captivate the audience and encourage downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. For example, in the context of a medical AI app, the skin scan feature with a danger level diagnosis would be a strong "wow factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.
*   **Reverse Engineering** A significant insight is to "reverse engineer" the design process by first considering how an influencer will present the product, and then designing the product around that presentation strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.

## Identifying Target Influencers

When seeking influencers, it's crucial to focus on the **audience** of the influencer rather than just their niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. For instance, while a doctor influencer might be niche-appropriate, their audience might consist primarily of aspiring medical professionals rather than the target consumer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.

A practical method to identify the target audience is to manually review comments on an influencer's posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. For an app like "Dr. AI" (a hypothetical medical AI app), a target audience might be concerned parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>. Therefore, influencers who are mothers and create "mom hack" content or "day in the life" videos would be ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

### Influencer Engagement and Storytelling
*   **Reaching Out** Engage with influencers through both email and direct messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.
*   **Seamless Integration** Aim for seamless integration of the product into the influencer's content. For example, a mom influencer could share a realistic scenario where they used the app to address a child's health concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>.
*   **Emotional Hooks** Campaigns should play on emotions, such as the fear of potential illness or the relief of quick, accessible information, to drive downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

## Pricing Structures with Influencers

When working with influencers, understanding RPM (Revenue Per Mille/Thousand Views) and CPM (Cost Per Mille/Thousand Views) is vital for profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>:
*   **Upfront Payment** Influencers prefer upfront payments rather than pay-per-view models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.
*   **Predicting Views** To ensure RPM is greater than CPM, accurately predict the likely views an influencer's content will receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.
*   **Example Calculation** If an app can generate $5 RPM (revenue per thousand views), and an influencer is expected to generate 1 million views from four posts, paying them under $5,000 for these posts would result in a profitable CPM (e.g., $4 CPM for $4,000 paid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>.
*   **Subscription Pricing** For utility apps where usage might be intermittent, a weekly pricing model (e.g., $4 a week) can be effective. This capitalizes on repeat users who re-subscribe on a need basis rather than maintaining a continuous subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
*   **A/B Testing** Consistently A/B test different pricing structures (e.g., $4 vs. $7 weekly, monthly, annual, with and without free trials) to determine the highest proceeds per download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>.

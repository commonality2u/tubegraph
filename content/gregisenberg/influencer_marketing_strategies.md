[[influencer_marketing_for_app_promotion | Influencer marketing]] is a primary lever to drive downloads for apps, especially those that may have low shareability organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This strategy can involve direct engagement with [[tips_for_negotiating_and_working_with_influencers | influencers]] or utilizing user-generated content (UGC) creators for paid advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

## Designing Apps for Influencer Marketing

When designing an app with [[influencer_marketing_and_outreach_tactics | influencer marketing]] in mind, it's crucial to consider how it will appear in an [[influencer_marketing_on_tik_tok | influencer]]'s video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>:

*   **Simplicity and Clarity** The app should be simple and clear enough for a viewer to understand its value proposition quickly, even if the phone is on screen for only a couple of seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. If the app is too convoluted, [[influencer_marketing_and_outreach_tactics | influencer marketing]] may not be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. Gamified and digestible elements, like a "danger level" metric, are not only good for the user experience but also enhance presentation in [[influencer_marketing_on_tik_tok | influencer]] videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.
*   **Branding** Place the app's name prominently on the homepage and on screens that [[tips_for_negotiating_and_working_with_influencers | influencers]] are most likely to showcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.
*   **"Wow" Factor** Identify the specific feature that will impress the audience and make them want to download the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. For example, a "scan skin" feature that provides a danger level and diagnosis is more impactful than a symptom quiz or a general chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.

## Influencer Selection and Content Strategy

When choosing [[tips_for_negotiating_and_working_with_influencers | influencers]], focus on their audience rather than just their niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. The audience is often similar to the [[tips_for_negotiating_and_working_with_influencers | influencer]] themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>.

*   **Audience Research** Manually read comments on an [[influencer_marketing_on_tik_tok | influencer]]'s videos to gauge their audience demographics and interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. For an app like Dr. AI, concerned parents (moms) are a key target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.
*   **Finding Similar Influencers** Once a suitable [[tips_for_negotiating_and_working_with_influencers | influencer]] is identified, explore who they follow or are followed by to discover other potential creators in the same demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.
*   **Seamless Integration** Encourage [[tips_for_negotiating_and_working_with_influencers | influencers]] to integrate the app naturally into their content, ideally through a skit or a realistic personal scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
*   **Emotional Angle** Content can play on emotions, such as a slight fear-mongering angle to highlight the app's utility in reassuring users about potential health concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. For example, a mom might share a story about her child's bump and how the app provided quick reassurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.

## Outreach and Pricing Strategies

Outreach to [[tips_for_negotiating_and_working_with_influencers | influencers]] can be done via both email and direct message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.

Key metrics for pricing [[influencer_marketing_as_a_service | influencer marketing as a service]] are:

*   **RPM (Revenue Per Thousand Views)**: The revenue generated for every thousand views on an [[tips_for_negotiating_and_working_with_influencers | influencer]]'s post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.
*   **CPM (Cost Per Thousand Views)**: The money spent on the post for every thousand views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.

To ensure profitability, RPM should be greater than CPM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.

*   **Upfront Payment** [[tips_for_negotiating_and_working_with_influencers | Influencers]] prefer to be paid upfront, not on a pay-per-view basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.
*   **Predicting Views** Estimate the likely number of views an [[tips_for_negotiating_and_working_with_influencers | influencer]]'s content will receive to structure a profitable deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. A common deal structure is four posts a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.
    *   *Example:* If an [[tips_for_negotiating_and_working_with_influencers | influencer]] averages 250,000 views per video, four videos would equate to 1 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. Assuming an RPM of $5 (which should be measured over time), paying the [[tips_for_negotiating_and_working_with_influencers | influencer]] under $5,000 for 1 million views would result in a profitable CPM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>.
*   **Pricing Strategy for App Subscriptions** For utility apps that users might need intermittently, a weekly pricing model (e.g., $4-$7 a week) can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. The focus is on capitalizing on repeat users who subscribe when needed, use the app, then unsubscribe, only to return for future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. A/B testing different pricing models (weekly, monthly, yearly) and free trial variations is crucial to determine the highest proceeds per download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.

For software companies, especially those targeting small and medium businesses (SMBs), influencer marketing has become a significant trend. This approach helps build trust and effectively educate potential users on how to utilize the software at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

## Core Strategy: YouTube Influencers and Affiliate Programs

A key strategy involves partnering with YouTubers to discuss and demonstrate the software product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. This is often structured with an affiliate program, offering recurring commissions (e.g., 30%) on sales generated through the influencer's content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. Influencers can be compensated with an upfront fee (e.g., $500 per video) in addition to these recurring commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

### Done-for-You Service Model

For software founders who lack the time or resources, a "done-for-you" [[influencer_marketing_and_partnerships|influencer marketing as a service]] can be invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.

This service involves:
1.  **Identifying Target Software Companies**
    *   Look for software companies that are "building in public" or frequently discussed on platforms like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. Examples include Instantly, Swell, or Harpy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.
2.  **Influencer Outreach**
    *   Offer unlimited influencer outreach, specifically targeting YouTube influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.
    *   YouTube channels typically list an email address in their "About" section, though it may be behind a CAPTCHA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
    *   Services like Fiverr can be used to find freelancers who specialize in YouTube lead generation or scraping these email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
3.  **Cold Email Campaigns**
    *   Utilize cold email software (e.g., Instantly) to reach out to collected influencer contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
    *   To maximize outreach, use multiple domains (e.g., 20) with multiple inboxes per domain (e.g., 2 inboxes), allowing for a high volume of daily emails (e.g., 32,000 cold emails per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
4.  **Brokering Deals and Optimization**
    *   Charge clients a monthly fee (e.g., $2,000-$3,000) for managing the influencer outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
    *   Clients may provide a budget for influencer payments (e.g., $50,000 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
    *   Analyze influencer data: Compare subscriber counts, view counts, and costs to identify "underpricing" opportunities and achieve a higher Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
    *   Generate reports showing affiliate commissions and ROI for the client, allowing for reinvestment into top-performing influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.

### Benefits and Growth Flywheel

*   **Established Relationships**: Over time, this process can lead to a core group of reliable influencers who consistently generate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **Organic Growth**: Once a product gains sufficient traction through paid influencer marketing, up-and-coming influencers in the same niche may review it for free, simply to earn affiliate commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. This creates a "growth flywheel" or "digital gravity" effect, attracting more affiliates and leading to sustained organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
*   **Revenue-Focused Approach**: Unlike many traditional influencer agencies, this model prioritizes conversion rates and return on ad spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

## Marketing the Influencer Service Itself

To attract software clients, the service provider can leverage YouTube as a top-of-funnel marketing channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.

### Tactics for Self-Promotion
*   **Daily Videos**: Create daily videos sharing experiments, lessons learned, and showcasing results (anonymized data) from influencer campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.
*   **Show, Don't Tell**: Instead of just talking about results, directly show growth graphs (up and to the right) in emails and videos to prove efficacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   **Authenticity**: Professional production isn't necessary; raw, authentic videos (e.g., Loom recordings with good audio) can be highly effective because the content's value outweighs production quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Long-Form Content**: Long-form content (videos over an hour) is significantly more impactful for B2B and service businesses, as it builds deeper trust required for higher-ticket sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.
*   **Negative CAC**: By generating ad revenue from YouTube and affiliate commissions from promoted tools, the service provider can achieve a "zero to negative Customer Acquisition Cost" (CAC), allowing for reinvestment into further marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.
*   **High-Value Impressions**: Topics related to digital marketing (like "Google Ads for XYZ") attract high-value impressions, leading to higher ad revenues for content creators due to competitive bidding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>.
*   **Top-of-Funnel Expertise**: Consistently producing valuable tutorial content positions the creator as an expert, leading to inbound leads for their service business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. This approach makes it possible to scale an agency rapidly, potentially reaching $30,000 per month within 200 days of daily video creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>.

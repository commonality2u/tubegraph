Influencer marketing is a significant trend, particularly for B2B and SMB software companies, as it helps build trust and educates users on how to effectively use software at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

## Core Strategy for Software Companies

One effective strategy involves leveraging YouTube influencers to discuss and demonstrate a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. This often involves an affiliate program, where influencers earn recurring commissions, for instance, 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. Companies might pay an initial fee (e.g., $500 per video) in addition to these commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

One company's growth strategy was entirely focused on YouTube videos, involving outreach to 300 YouTubers and manually finding their emails and commenting on videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. This approach is time-consuming, leading to the idea of a "done-for-you" [[marketing_through_influencer_partnerships | influencer marketing]] service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

## How to Implement a Done-for-You Influencer Marketing Service

1.  **Identify Software Companies**: Find software companies that are building their products publicly, often seen on platforms like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.
2.  **Offer Unlimited Influencer Outreach**: Propose a service of unlimited outreach to YouTube influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.
3.  **Gather Influencer Contacts**: YouTube channels often display email addresses in their "About" section, though they may be behind a captcha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. Services on platforms like Fiverr can scrape these emails for "YouTube lead generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.
4.  **Cold Email Campaigns**: Use a cold email software to reach out to these influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. This acts as a service company that brokers relationships and deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
5.  **Budget and Analysis**: Clients provide a budget (e.g., $50,000 per month) for influencer work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. After contacting many influencers (e.g., 500), analyze their subscriber counts, view counts, and costs to create a ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. This helps identify underpriced subsets of influencers for better ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
6.  **Reporting and Reinvestment**: Generate reports showing affiliate commissions from influencers to identify those creating the most revenue impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. Reinvest capital into top-performing influencers and cycle in new groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.

## Benefits and Flywheel Effect

By getting enough influencers to talk about a product, a "growth flywheel" is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. Up-and-coming influencers in the same niche may review the product for free, driven by the desire to earn affiliate commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. This creates a "digital gravity" that attracts more affiliates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>, resulting in a virtuous cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. This approach directly addresses a common challenge for founders in the software space, who often lack the time or knowledge to set up such systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

## Positioning for Success

To differentiate an [[influencer_marketing_and_its_impact | influencer marketing]] agency, focus on being revenue-focused and RoaS (Return on Ad Spend) focused, rather than simply getting influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. A founder letter on the website that shares a personal story about past struggles with ineffective influencer spending can resonate with potential clients who have faced similar issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

## Integrating with Content Marketing

This strategy can be paired with a strong content marketing presence, especially on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. Daily videos about influencer marketing experiments, sharing anonymous data and "up and to the right" graphs of affiliate commissions, can establish expertise and generate inbound leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. This [[growth_strategies_using_creators_and_social_media | growth strategy using creators and social media]] turns the channel into a top-of-funnel for service businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.

### The Power of Long-Form Content

Long-form content (e.g., videos over an hour) is significantly more impactful for B2B and service businesses, generating 10x more revenue than short-form content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. This type of content builds deep trust, essential for selling higher-ticket items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.

Even "sweaty" or less professionally produced videos (e.g., Loom videos with good audio and an iPhone) can be effective if the content is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. If 1% of 2,000 views convert into a paying customer (e.g., $5,000 base fee per month), it can generate substantial new revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>. This demonstrates that long-form content acts as a "virtual sales letter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.

For additional [[marketing_strategies_for_ai_products | marketing strategies for AI products]], long-form YouTube tutorials demonstrating how to use AI writers to create SEO content can be highly effective, leading to a viral funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. Impressions for high-value search terms like "Google ads for XYZ" are expensive, and YouTube RPMs will be high due to the high value of the audience and long watch times from tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>.

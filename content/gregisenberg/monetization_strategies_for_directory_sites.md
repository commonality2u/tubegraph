Online directories offer a significant opportunity for [[building_passive_income_through_online_directories | passive income]], with the potential to generate anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000 per month, requiring only about 15 minutes of work per week to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Frey's first directory website, built in October 2022, has been [[monetizing_online_directories | monetized]] for 18 consecutive months, requiring minimal maintenance, and earned approximately $2,300 in a recent month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Common [[Monetizing Websites Through Different Strategies | Monetization Strategies]]

### Display Ads
Display advertising is a common and straightforward method for [[monetizing_online_directories | monetizing directory websites]], offering a highly passive income stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This is particularly effective for static pillar page directories due to their long page format, allowing for numerous ad placements, similar to how longer YouTube videos generate more ad revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.

Examples of directories primarily using display ads:
*   **RoadsideAmerica.com**: A directory for quirky roadside attractions in the United States, receives 85,000 monthly visitors. Approximately 96% of its traffic is Tier 1 (US, Canada, Australia, UK). It is estimated to passively generate $5,000 to $7,000 per month through display ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **AtlasObscura.com**: A worldwide directory of off-the-beaten-path attractions, attracts 1.1 million monthly visitors with 90-91% Tier 1 traffic. It is [[Monetizing websites through different strategies | monetized]] through display ads (AdSense) and also sells a book. Conservative estimates suggest it makes around $30,000 per month from AdSense, potentially closer to $50,000-$60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **FindAGrave.com**: A directory for burial sites, boasts 1.4 million monthly visitors and 92% Tier 1 traffic. Its main form of [[Monetizing websites through different strategies | monetization]] is AdSense, with estimated earnings ranging from $60,000 to $100,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## [[Monetization Strategies Beyond Ads | Advanced Monetization Strategies]]

While display ads offer passive income, there are strategies to significantly increase earning potential and build more valuable businesses:

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
A key opportunity lies in building software on top of directories. Directories can capture substantial traffic within a specific niche, and this engaged audience can then be funneled into a SaaS product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. With AI tools, SaaS can be built almost instantly, leading to higher valuations typical of software businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Farm Directory with SaaS Integration
> A directory for farms and CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture) uses its website traffic to funnel users into a SaaS product it owns. The directory features advertisements for this software, making it a "perfect example" of leveraging relevant website traffic for a proprietary SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

### Affiliate Marketing
For niches like the pet space, affiliate marketing offers interesting plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>. If users are searching for dog parks, there might be an alignment of search intent with products related to dog health or supplies, making affiliate programs relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.

### Newsletters and Lead Magnets
Building an email list or creating a lead magnet can be a powerful way to collect valuable data from users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. This data itself can be a significant asset, as seen with companies like BarkBox, which was acquired for $90 million largely due to the value of the DNA data they collected, far exceeding their annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. A dog park directory, for instance, could create a [[monetization_through_newsletters | newsletter]] to gather data about dog owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>.

### Selling Leads to Service-Based Businesses
Programmatic directories that specialize in connecting users with service-based businesses by selling leads are highlighted as having "amazing" earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

## Income Potential and Business Philosophy

A directory website can provide "mailbox money"â€”enough to cover bills and rent monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>. This passive income can allow creators to pursue other passions, maintain a full-time job, or serve as a foundation for a much larger business idea, such as transforming a dog park directory into a SaaS product for public parks or a consumer product competing with established pet brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that online directories are often underrated and overlooked by typical tech founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>. Despite their "boring" appearance, their effectiveness in attracting traffic and generating income is undeniable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.

[[Creating art and branding with AI | Creating Disney-style images]] and content, similar to Pixar animations, is achievable using various AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This type of content can significantly drive revenue for businesses through effective storytelling in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Shift in Business Operations with AI
Recent shifts in business, influenced by factors like the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of AI, have transformed product development, marketing, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>:

*   **Product Development**: Traditionally, launching a product involved raising VC capital and hiring software engineers, taking years and significant costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Now, with AI, products can be built instantly at low cost and with zero employees, eliminating the need for extensive engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This change represents a major "technical shift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: The previous model relied on social media budgets, creative teams, professional advertising, and seasonal big campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Today, "solopreneurs" are pushing into the mainstream by transparently sharing their financial progress and stories, engaging audiences daily through "always-on" marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This signifies an "audience shift" in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Operations**: Historically, hiring talent for productivity and requiring physical office spaces were standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The "cultural shift" now allows for remote working, reducing office costs and enabling teams to build faster with fewer people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

An individual can now perform the work of five or six people by [[utilizing_ai_tools_for_content_creation_and_marketing | utilizing AI tools for content creation and marketing]] like ChatGPT and Leonardo AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## Sequential Prompting for AI Content Creation
Beyond conversational and master prompts, a third technique for [[creative_workflows_and_tools_in_ai_design | using AI]] is "sequential prompting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This method involves using ChatGPT to generate a prompt that will then be used in a *different* AI tool to create a specific output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This allows for a layered approach to content creation:

1.  **ChatGPT**: Generate a prompt based on input (e.g., an image) and desired output characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
2.  **Secondary AI Tool (e.g., Leonardo AI)**: Take the generated prompt and feed it into an image generation tool to create an image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
3.  **Further Tools (e.g., Cling AI, Eleven Labs)**: Continue the sequence by taking the output (e.g., an image) and using it in another tool to add animation or voiceovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

This entire process can be manually performed for rapid iteration and feedback, and then automated using tools like Zapier or by integrating APIs for a seamless user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Workflow: Creating Disney-Style AI Avatars and Content

### Step 1: Generating a Consistent Character Prompt with ChatGPT
To create a Disney-style AI avatar, a specific prompt structure is needed to customize and control the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

1.  **Input Image and Details**: Provide ChatGPT with an image reference (e.g., of a child) and basic details like name, age, and gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
2.  **Prompt Structure**: ChatGPT is instructed to describe the person as a prompt, including details like hairstyle, skin tone, and accessories, based on the uploaded image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. ChatGPT has the ability to read and assess images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
3.  **Output Prompt**: ChatGPT generates a detailed prompt that ensures consistency for the character across different scenes or narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

### Step 2: Generating Images with Leonardo AI
The prompt from ChatGPT is then used in Leonardo AI, an AI tool capable of creating various fun and stylized images, including Disney-style or even Simpson-style images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

1.  **Paste Prompt**: Copy the generated prompt from ChatGPT into Leonardo AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
2.  **Generate Image**: Adjust settings like aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9 for widescreen) and ensure "Prompt Enhance" is off to maintain prompt integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. The image can be generated within seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
3.  **Programmatic Use**: Leonardo AI has an API, allowing for programmatic image generation. This means a user could upload an image to a custom interface, which then connects to ChatGPT's API to get a prompt, and then sends that prompt to Leonardo AI's API to generate the final image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

### Step 3: Animating Images with Cling AI
Cling AI specializes in turning images into videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

1.  **Upload Image**: Download the generated image from Leonardo AI and upload it to Cling AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.
2.  **Add Prompts**: Additional prompts can be added to instruct specific actions within the scene (e.g., "sip the cup") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.
3.  **Generate Video**: Cling AI can turn static images into moving video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>.
4.  **Lip Sync Feature**: Cling AI also includes a "dub feature" that allows characters to lip-sync to words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.
While useful, video generation is currently slower, taking about four minutes for a five-second clip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. This suggests a potential for manual human assistance for premium video offerings until speed improves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

### Step 4: Removing Backgrounds with Remove.BG
For use cases like stickers, removing the image background is crucial.

1.  **Upload Image**: Take the generated image and upload it to Remove.BG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
2.  **Automatic Background Removal**: Remove.BG uses AI to automatically cut out the background, creating a transparent PNG sticker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
3.  **API Integration**: Like other tools, Remove.BG has an API, allowing for automated background removal in a workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.

## Business Opportunities with AI-Generated Content

## Apple Watch and Sleep Apnea Detection

The Apple Watch has introduced a feature capable of diagnosing sleep apnea, a disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This is significant because an estimated 80% to 90% of people with sleep apnea are undiagnosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. The widespread use of Apple Watches means that many individuals will automatically receive alerts about potential sleep apnea, prompting them to seek further information and treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

This development creates new business opportunities, including:
*   **Sleep Apnea Clinics:** An increase in diagnoses will lead to higher demand for these clinics, which facilitate the rigorous process required to obtain a CPAP machine, a device that pushes air to keep airways clear during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. CPAP machines typically cost around $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **CPAP Machine Distributorships:** Owning a distributorship for companies like ResMed could be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Review Websites:** Creating affiliate websites that review different sleep apnea hardware and alternative treatments is a viable business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   **Alternative Treatments:** Many people are reluctant to wear CPAP machines due to their appearance and discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. This opens an opportunity for direct-to-consumer (DTC) businesses offering oral devices and other alternative treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.
*   **Mobile Applications:** Developing apps that utilize Apple Watch data to monitor sleep apnea in more depth or provide coaching for users is another area for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   **Financing Businesses:** Offering financing solutions for individuals needing to purchase sleep apnea hardware could also be an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

## Expanding Health Monitoring Trends

The impact of new technology like the Apple Watch's sleep apnea detection highlights a broader trend in health monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. This includes:
*   **Blood Glucose Monitoring:** It's anticipated that within the next five years, Apple Watches may include blood glucose sensors, enabling widespread personal blood sugar monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs), such as those from Dexcom, already reveal surprising information about the impact of food on blood sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.
*   **[[ai_technology_in_healthcare | AI]] in Diagnostics:** Using [[ai_technology_in_healthcare | AI]] tools like Claude can identify other undiagnosed illnesses detectable by wearables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Examples include:
    *   **Atrial Fibrillation (AFib):** Many smartwatches can detect irregular heart rhythms indicative of AFib <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.
    *   **Hypertension and Diabetes:** These conditions may also become more detectable through wearable technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.
    *   **Stress and Anxiety:** Wearables could potentially identify these states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **Mental Health Assessments:** [[ai_technology_in_healthcare | AI]] can streamline mental health assessments, making diagnoses for conditions like ADHD, anxiety, and depression more accessible and affordable than traditional methods which can cost thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. ADHD, in particular, is widely undiagnosed, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

These [[future_trends_in_consumer_tech | future trends in consumer tech]] indicate a "super cycle" where minor advancements in devices like the Apple Watch can prompt millions to consider new health aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

## Computer Vision in Physical Spaces

While [[ai_technology_in_healthcare | AI]] in health is growing, another area of innovation is computer vision applied to physical spaces. Previously a high-cost enterprise solution, it's now becoming more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.
*   **Retail Analytics:** Simple webcams or old iPhones can be used in businesses like delis to create heat maps showing customer movement, popular areas, lingering spots, and skipped items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   **Anonymized Facial Recognition:** This technology can identify repeat customers, analyze peak times for new versus returning visitors, and pinpoint areas of confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.
*   **Safety and Security:** Computer vision systems can identify smoke, potential fires, or the presence of weapons like guns or knives in commercial spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. This technology is being explored as a replacement for security guards in high-risk environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

The ethical implications of such pervasive monitoring in physical spaces are debated, with some finding it creepy, especially given the existing digital tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>. However, it could enhance customer experience, for instance, by allowing staff to know customer preferences upon entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

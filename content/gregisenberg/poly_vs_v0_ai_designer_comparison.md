From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

This article explores and compares two AI product design tools, Poly and V0, based on a live demonstration of their capabilities. The primary goal was to assess whether these AI product designers can deliver on their promise of creating "production ready code" and "beautiful designs" from English prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Poly: Initial Impressions and Workflow

Poly, a Y Combinator startup, is described as an AI product designer that allows users to write English prompts to generate designs and front-end code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The user tried Poly for the first time on camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, having seen impressive output examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

The interface of Poly resembles a chat-based AI like ChatGPT, where users can type or use a microphone to input their design requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. A notable [[features_and_control_levels_of_various_ai_coding_platforms | feature]] is the ability to upload an image, such as a hand-drawn wireframe, for the AI to reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### First Design Attempt: YouTube Analytics Tool

For the demonstration, the user proposed building a multi-million dollar business idea: an AI tool for YouTubers that predicts video engagement (comments, likes, subscribers) based on title and thumbnail changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This idea was inspired by a viral tweet about an algorithm predicting tweet performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

The initial prompt to Poly included:
*   **Concept**: An algorithm to predict YouTube video engagement based on title and thumbnail changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Request**: Create a SaaS (Software as a Service) product that does this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Style**: "Glassy minimalist and with colorful calls to action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. An image reference of a tweet analytics tool was also provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

#### Initial Results and [[challenges_with_ai_design_tools | Challenges]]

The first output from Poly was a landing page for the product, named "To Predict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. However, it largely failed to meet expectations:
*   **No Product Interface**: It only generated a landing page, not the actual product interface or internal dashboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Non-Functional Demo**: Clicking "Get Started" or "See Demo" resulted in a "black screen of death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Style Mismatch**: The design did not feel "glassy" as requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Generation Time**: It took "a few minutes" to generate, with no progress bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Second Design Attempt: Refinement with Specific Terminology

To address the style issue, the user learned the specific design term "glass morphism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. The user reprompted Poly, expressing disappointment and explicitly asking it to create the product interface with glassmorphism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

### Third Design Attempt: Product Interface

The third attempt yielded a much improved result. While not perfectly glassy, it showed significant progress towards the requested style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Crucially, it generated an actual product interface with features like:
*   Version A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>
*   Commutative engagement charts with hover functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>
*   Statistical confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>
*   Recent optimizations and AI suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>
*   Title Optimizer and performance comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>

The design included "beautiful" charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>, but some details, like referencing "image" instead of "video" format, still needed correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

## V0: Comparison and Workflow

V0 by Vercel is another well-known product in the [[ai_in_design_industry | AI designer space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The user had previous experience with V0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Using the same prompt and image as for Poly, V0's generation process offered a key advantage: it provided a reasoning for its actions, stating its understanding of the request and how it planned to execute it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. This transparency made the user feel "way more at ease" compared to Poly's "black box" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

### V0 Design Results

V0 also produced a design for the YouTube analytics tool, which "literally just copied the image" provided, but also built out the functional product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Key features included:
*   Version A/B testing elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>
*   Sections for original content title, description, and thumbnail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>
*   Performance prediction with AI recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>

When asked if the design was "glass morphic," V0 acknowledged that while it had some glass-like elements, it would enhance them for a "more pronounced blur effects, light borders and depth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. This interactive feedback mechanism was highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial Experience**   | Unfamiliar, felt like shouting into a "dark hole" due to lack of feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. | More transparent, provided reasoning for actions, made the user feel "at ease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.          |
| **Generation Speed**     | Felt slower, took a "minute or two" without a progress bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.                  | Felt faster due to conversational feedback, actual speed might be similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.                 |
| **Output Quality**       | Needed multiple prompts to generate product interface; final product was functional and in-depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. | Generated product interface faster, but initially "literally copied the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.          |
| **Visual Appeal**        | Good, but arguably "a little bit uglier" than V0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.                              | Arguably "a little bit nicer" visually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.                                                 |
| **Interactive Feedback** | Minimal; no questions asked, no rationale provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.                            | Conversational; acknowledged requests and explained how it would implement them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.             |
| **Feature Retention**    | Retains previous designs on the right sidebar, rollback feature available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.        | (Not explicitly mentioned if it saves history, but implied similar functionality)                                                                 |
| **Credit System**        | Uses credits (50 per page, 25 per component) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.                               | (Not explicitly mentioned in the transcript, but V0 also uses a credit system)                                                                   |

### Key Takeaways and Recommendations

*   **Prompt Engineering is Crucial**: To get the most out of these tools, users need to understand and use specific design terms (like "glassmorphism") and know what's trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. The claim of an "AI product designer at your service" implies it should understand intent, but currently, users still need precise input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This highlights [[challenges_with_ai_design_tools | challenges with AI design tools]].
*   **The Bar is High**: User expectations for AI products are now incredibly high; the output needs to be "incredible" to be integrated into a workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **V0 Currently Leads**: Based on this comparison, V0 is slightly better due to its conversational feedback and arguably nicer visual design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   **Leverage Multiple Tools**: The ultimate "AI product designer" experience comes from using a combination of tools like V0 and Poly, alongside large language models such as [[using_ai_models_like_claude_and_v0_with_cursor_ai | Claude]], ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini. Each tool has its nuances and strengths that can be combined for optimal results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. This is a common theme across [[ai_coding_tools_comparison | AI coding tools comparison]] and [[features_and_control_levels_of_various_ai_coding_platforms | features and control levels]] of various AI coding platforms.
*   **Startup Idea**: The demonstrated idea of a SaaS product for YouTube analytics and engagement prediction is considered a "multi-million dollar year business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, and the user encourages others to pursue it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.

From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Online directories offer a significant opportunity for generating passive income, with potential earnings ranging from $2,000 to $10,000 per month from a single directory, often requiring as little as 15 minutes of maintenance per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This approach focuses on creating "evergreen, location-based directories" that require minimal ongoing updates due to the nature of their data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## Frey's Approach to Online Directories

Frey, an experienced online directory builder, highlights that his first directory, built in October 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, has been monetized for 18 months straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. It currently generates around $2,300 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> and takes approximately 15 minutes a month to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This method, often simpler than traditional directory websites with modern maps, focuses on basic, highly optimized content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. While AI tools can be recommended for parts of the process, they are not strictly necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Core Principles for Building Directories

The process of [[starting_an_online_directory | building an online directory]] to generate passive income involves several key steps:
*   **Finding and Validating a Niche**: Identifying a problem and ensuring there's demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Data Acquisition and Enrichment**: Gathering and enhancing relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Website Implementation**: Setting up the directory using a Content Management System (CMS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Monetization Strategies**: Implementing ways to generate income, from display ads to more complex models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Case Studies of Successful Directories

Several examples demonstrate the potential of online directories, even those with seemingly "boring" or niche content:

*   **RoadsideAmerica.com**: A directory of quirky roadside attractions in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Despite a dated appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, it receives 85,000 monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, with 96% Tier 1 traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. It is monetized through display ads and is estimated to make $5,000 to $7,000 per month passively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This is a basic static directory, similar to the type Frey teaches how to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **AtlasObscura.com**: A worldwide directory of off-the-beaten-path attractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This directory boasts over 1 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, with 90-91% Tier 1 traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. It is monetized through display ads (AdSense) and also sells a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Conservative estimates place its AdSense earnings around $30,000 a month, potentially closer to $50,000-$60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **FindAGrave.com**: A directory for locating burial sites, including those of historical figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This niche site receives 1.4 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, with 92% Tier 1 traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Its primary monetization is AdSense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, with estimated earnings of $60,000-$70,000 per month, potentially reaching $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

These examples highlight that highly specific, problem-solving directories can achieve substantial traffic and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Building an Online Directory: A Step-by-Step Example (Dog Parks)

### 1. Niche Selection and Validation
[[Validating and finding niche ideas for directories | Finding a niche]] involves identifying keywords with high search volume and low competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

*   **Identifying Evergreen and Location-Based Niches**: Frey prefers "evergreen location-based directories" because the data remains relevant over time, reducing upkeep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Using Ahrefs**: Ahrefs' Keyword Explorer is used by typing "near me" to find local queries with high search volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. The "sweet spot" for monthly searches is between 30,000 and 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Specific Niches**:
    *   **Seasonal Niches**: Like "pumpkin patches near me," as they only monetize well for a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   **Difficult Data Acquisition**: Niches like "earthquake near me" where data is hard to obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
    *   **Branded Keywords**: Such as "Taco Bell near me," as large brands likely have their own solutions and the search intent is often too one-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Example Niche: Dog Parks Near Me**: This keyword gets 73,000 monthly searches and has a moderate keyword difficulty of 27/100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. More importantly, it shows "fragmentation in search intent," with users looking for "indoor dog park," "off-leash dog park," or "dog water park" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. This multi-dimensional intent allows for richer data and more useful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Generally, a keyword difficulty under 20 is considered easy, though this metric can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

### 2. Competitive Research (Google)
After identifying a niche, perform competitive research by searching Google for "[Niche] [City]" (e.g., "Dog Park Los Angeles") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

*   **Identify Competitors**: Look for existing directories on the first page of results.
*   **Assess Opportunities for Improvement**: Analyze competitors like "nyabone.com," which is a basic dog park directory getting 21,000 monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Despite its simplicity, only listing names and addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>, its traffic indicates an unmet need. This signals a "bounty" to build a better, more feature-rich directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. Even dominant sites like "BringFido.com" (which gets 13,000 monthly visitors for dog parks) can be improved by adding detailed features like dog bags, water fountains, or benches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

### 3. Validating the Problem (Social Listening)
Use platforms like Reddit to confirm user pain points and needs. Search for "[Niche] Reddit" (e.g., "Dog Park Los Angeles Reddit") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.

*   **Find Discussions**: Look for forums where people are actively seeking information or discussing difficulties related to the niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
*   **Identify Specific Needs**: A Reddit post about dog parks in New York (where they're called "dog runs") revealed a user wishing for descriptions and photos, noting that "not all dog runs are created equal" and wanting to find "really nice ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. This is a strong signal that users desire curated, hyperspecific features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.
*   **Confirm Problem Worth Solving**: This validation confirms that people are looking elsewhere for solutions, indicating a clear problem to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.

### 4. Data Acquisition
The primary method for acquiring data for directories is web scraping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.

*   **Tools**: Outscraper.com is a recommended tool for Google Maps scraping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.
*   **Google Maps Categories**: Start by going to Google Maps and searching for your niche (e.g., "Dog Park Los Angeles") to identify if there's a dedicated Google category (e.g., "dog park") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. Scraping an exact match category yields cleaner data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
*   **Plain Queries**: If an exact category isn't available, a "plain query" (e.g., "off leash dog parks") can be used, but it will result in more "junk" data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Desired Data Points**: Essential data points include name, phone number, address, postal code, state, reviews, street view, operating hours, and location link (crucial for data enrichment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.
*   **Nationwide Directories**: It's often beneficial to create nationwide directories to leverage all available search volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>. For example, scraping for "dog park" across the US yielded 6,245 listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.

### 5. Data Cleaning and Enrichment
Cleaning involves removing irrelevant or low-quality listings, such as those without addresses or with very few reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

*   **Manual vs. AI for Cleaning**: While large datasets might require manual initial cleanup to remove obvious junk (e.g., Walmart listings showing up for "dog park" due to reviews) to prevent "throwing the baby out with the bath water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>, AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude can assist with parsing if given solid prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
*   **Data Enrichment**: This is critical for differentiating your directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. It involves adding specific features that users are looking for but existing directories or Google Maps don't easily provide.
    *   **Methods**: Manually reviewing Google Maps reviews for recurring tags (e.g., "shade," "parking," "water," "benches," "dog bags," "trash cans") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
    *   **Automation**: Frey is developing a tool that uses the location ID/Google URL to automate data enrichment by reading reviews and identifying specific features (e.g., "does this dog park have shade?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>. This automation saves immense time, especially for large datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.

### 6. Website Implementation ([[Building an online directory with WordPress and Ahrefs | WordPress]] & Pillar Pages)

*   **CMS Choice**: While more modern tools like Framer or Bolt.new are emerging, a basic WordPress setup can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. Frey's first directory used Elementor Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.
*   **Static Pillar Page Directory**: This is a "level one" directory build, differing from traditional map-based directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.
    *   **Concept**: A single, very long, comprehensive page that serves as a "pillar page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. It's a slightly outdated SEO principle but still works well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>.
    *   **Structure**: Includes a header with the main keyword, a table of contents, and targets city-specific keywords (e.g., "Dog Park Long Beach") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. Each section provides enriched data for listings (e.g., photos, address, phone, hours, map embed, reviews, and specific features like "shade" or "benches") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.
    *   **SEO Benefits**: This format leverages the highest search volume keywords, which are often location-specific pages (e.g., "dog friendly restaurant New York") rather than individual listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. A single state page can rank for over 1,300 keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>.
    *   **Internal Linking**: A simple internal linking strategy where users can click on different states to explore parks within those regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.
    *   **Monetization Suitability**: Ideal for display ad monetization due to the naturally long pages, allowing for many ad placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies for Online Directories

[[monetizing_online_directories | Monetizing online directories]] goes beyond basic display ads:

*   **Display Ads**: Placing AdSense or similar display ads is a primary source of passive income for many directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Frey considers AdSense the closest he's experienced to passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Long pillar pages are particularly effective for this due to numerous ad placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>.
*   **Selling Products/Books**: Some directories, like AtlasObscura.com, supplement ad revenue by selling related products such as books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **[[building_and_monetizing_lead_generation | Building SaaS on Top of Directories]]**: A key strategy is to use directories to gain traffic and eyeballs in a specific niche, then develop a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product on top of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This provides higher SaaS multiples and leverages the consistent traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. An example is a farm/CSA directory that funnels relevant traffic into their own SaaS product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. AI can be used to build software instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **[[monetizing_online_directories_through_ads_and_affiliate_marketing | Affiliate Marketing]]**: Especially in niches like the pet space, there's potential for affiliate plays (e.g., partnering with companies like BarkBox) if the product aligns with user intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   **Lead Generation/Data Collection**: Create lead magnets or newsletters to collect data on users (e.g., dog owners for a dog park directory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. This data can be valuable, as seen with companies like BarkBox, which was acquired for its data on dog and cat DNA kits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.
*   **Programmatic SEO/Lead Selling**: Higher earning potential exists with programmatic directories that sell leads to service-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>.

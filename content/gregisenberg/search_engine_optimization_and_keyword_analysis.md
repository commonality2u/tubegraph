Understanding [[effective_use_of_seo_and_paid_ads_for_startup_growth | SEO]] (Search Engine Optimization) and keyword analysis is crucial for creating successful products, whether in the CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) or software sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This approach involves leveraging data and trends to identify demand and competitive landscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Many lessons learned from CPG can be applied to software startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Ahrefs: A Key Tool for Keyword Analysis

Ahrefs is a powerful tool primarily used in the [[seo_strategies_for_highvalue_keywords | SEO]] world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. It helps evaluate opportunities by providing insights into search volume and keyword difficulty for any given term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Key Metrics
Ahrefs displays two core metrics for any keyword:
*   **Keyword Difficulty (KD)**: A score from 0 to 100 indicating how hard it is to rank for a term on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. A high score (e.g., 88 for "electrolytes") suggests significant competition, requiring substantial time, money, and expertise to rank in the top search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Search Volume**: The general sense of how many times a keyword or term is searched on Google each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Evaluating Category Demand and Trends
Ahrefs is effective for evaluating category demand and trends in specific spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. For example, analyzing "electrolytes" shows rising demand over the years with seasonal peaks in June and July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

It also reveals geographic opportunities. For instance, the search volume for "electrolytes" is predominantly in English-speaking Western countries (US, UK, Canada, Australia account for 74% of global searches), suggesting an opportunity to build similar products in non-English speaking markets like Germany, India, or the Philippines where demand may be untapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This approach of taking proven business models from one region and applying them to another is considered smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### Identifying Opportunities and Competition
Ahrefs helps identify where existing demand is and how crowded a space is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. An example is the "Solitaire" keyword, which has 8.5 million monthly searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. An SEO expert could identify undervalued web properties ranking lower in search results, acquire them, and improve their [[seo_strategies_for_highvalue_keywords | SEO]] to drive them to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Alternatively, as seen with Solitaire, if top-ranking sites are unwilling to sell due to their profitability, one can build a new site from scratch and invest in SEO to outrank competitors over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### Application for Startups
Before building any product, especially software like accounting software for vets, it's advisable to use Ahrefs to "gut check" the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. This helps assess if there's organic demand and if the category is too crowded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

## Beyond the Data: Understanding the "Why"

While Ahrefs provides data, it's crucial to understand the "why" behind the trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. For example, the explosive growth of CBD in 2019 was due to the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalized hemp-based products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Its subsequent decline correlates with the rise of Delta-9 THC, a legal hemp-derived product that offers similar effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:14:05]</a>. This analytical approach, asking "why" trends occur, is key to identifying real opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## Connecting SEO to Product Development and Marketing

When launching a product, whether physical or software, the primary focus should be on distribution and customer acquisition channels before building the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. This involves figuring out which niche to target and how to speak to that audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. Companies with strong distribution and operational excellence can succeed even with subpar products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.

## AI's Role in [[using_ai_for_seo_optimization | SEO Optimization]] and Research

AI tools can act as "research agents" to parse data and category trends, providing valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. For instance, Manis, an AI tool, can research competitors, analyze product details, and research specific customer needs (e.g., skincare for older adults) very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. This capability offers an "unfair advantage" because it allows for extensive market research that historically would have cost tens of thousands of dollars and taken much longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.

AI can also assist in the initial design phase for CPG products. Tools like Midjourney can generate V1 packaging designs, which can then be refined by a freelance designer for a much lower cost than hiring a full agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. This helps founders clarify their vision before making significant investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

## Conclusion: Distribution First

Regardless of whether one is building a software or physical product, success hinges on working backward from distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. First-time founders often focus on product, while second-time founders prioritize distribution, a truism in entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>. Focusing on how to acquire customers and identifying winning channels is paramount before developing the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>.

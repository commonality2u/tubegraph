Many people are waiting for AI development to become easier before they begin building projects, but there's a significant opportunity right now for those who dive in early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Starting when it's still challenging offers a distinct advantage, as those who begin now will be creating even more advanced sites by the time the process becomes simpler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Advantage of Early Adoption

Currently, there are not many individuals pushing the boundaries of AI websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This environment presents potentially the most profitable industries and interesting niches to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The advice for anyone considering waiting is to start now, as the process will become easier over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>.

### Embracing the Challenge
While the initial setup for [[building_a_successful_ai_startup | AI development]] can be challenging, as experienced by the speaker during a previous podcast where he "struggled through" making an app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[00:01:03]</a>, overcoming these early hurdles is key. The initial struggles are often due to setting up the foundational template and API connections, which, once established, make subsequent changes much smoother and more enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:40">[02:37:40]</a>.

> [!tip] Learning Through Errors
> Expecting errors is a crucial part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. In the early stages, errors are natural and can often be resolved by simply copying and pasting the error message back into the AI tool for a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:22">[02:25:22]</a>. This iterative process of encountering and resolving errors helps developers improve their skills and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:36">[02:36:36]</a>. It's important to remember that these large language models (LLMs) are non-deterministic, meaning they can behave differently in various situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:04">[02:41:04]</a>.

## Benefits of Starting Now

*   **Massive Opportunity**: The current landscape offers a huge chance to create agencies and build projects, as few people are exploring the cutting edge of AI website development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>.
*   **Rapid [[using_ai_for_rapid_mvp_development | MVP Development]]**: A minimal viable product can be built in as little as a day, or even an hour or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>. This allows for quick experimentation and testing of numerous ideas to see what gains traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>.
*   **Iterative Improvement**: Start with core functionality, even if the design isn't perfect, and then refine the aesthetics later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>. The core functionality is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Idea Illustration**: Tools like V0 enable users to visually illustrate complex ideas and features, replacing traditional text-based communication with tangible prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. This is particularly useful for internal company proposals or pitching new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.
*   **Personal Reward**: Building something from your own ideas using AI can be "addicting" and deeply satisfying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.

## [[planning_before_using_ai_tools | Planning and Workflow]]

A key insight for [[tips_for_developers_using_ai_in_app_development | developers using AI in app development]] is the importance of having a full plan in mind before starting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Without a clear plan, developers can get stuck and find it difficult to maintain an organized project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:50">[01:39:50]</a>.

### Workflow Tips
*   **Component-based Development**: Focus on designing and building one component at a time (e.g., a card, a button, a profile section) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This approach makes it easier to visualize design changes in real-time, reduces generation time, and prevents overwhelming the AI's context window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Saving Progress**: Regularly save progress using version control systems like Git to allow easy reversion to previous states if issues arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>.
*   **Clear Prompts**: When communicating with AI, describe the current situation first, then specifically state what needs to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:28">[03:25:28]</a>. Being overly specific, even providing screenshots and annotations, helps the AI understand the exact desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:50">[03:29:50]</a>. If uncertain, instruct the AI to "create whatever is necessary to address this issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:07">[03:50:07]</a>.
*   **Resetting Context**: After completing a feature or resolving a major issue, it's beneficial to reset the AI's "composer" (or context window) to focus on new problems without being influenced by prior discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:09">[03:11:09]</a>.

## The Future of [[ai_in_startup_ideation_and_execution | AI in Startup Ideation and Execution]]

The ease of [[creating_startup_ideas_using_ai | creating startup ideas using AI]] and building apps will lead to new platforms, akin to TikTok, where people can share and remix web applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:36">[01:25:36]</a>. This will make the process of putting out software as simple as sharing a tweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a>, fostering a community of "builders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:18">[01:38:18]</a>. The ultimate goal is for AI to function exactly like a human designer or employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:18">[01:43:18]</a>.

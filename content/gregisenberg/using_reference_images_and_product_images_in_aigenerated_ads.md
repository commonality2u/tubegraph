Creating successful advertisements with [[creating_ads_using_ai_with_chatgpt_4o | AI]] can significantly increase return on ad spend (ROAS) and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The key lies in effectively prompting [[ai_models_for_generating_photorealistic_images_and_ad_content | AI models]] like ChatGPT 4o to generate winning ad creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This approach allows for rapid experimentation and scaling of ad content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Leveraging Reference and Product Imagery
For [[leveraging_ai_for_content_and_image_generation | AI models]] like ChatGPT 4o, which are multimodal language models rather than pure image models, prompting is less critical than providing strong inspiration and product images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The model's understanding of intent and creativity means straightforward prompts can yield excellent results when combined with relevant imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Example 1: Jones Road Beauty
This example demonstrates combining an inspiration ad with a custom product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Prompt**: "Add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Result**: The AI successfully created an ad that followed these instructions, featuring a woman at the top, overlapping products, and text below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Application**: By swapping out characters or product images, businesses can test various audiences (men, female, old, young, different colors) to see what converts best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This enables targeted advertising for specific personas using either AI-generated photorealistic images or custom photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Example 2: Adidas (No Reference Image)
For well-known brands like Nike or Adidas, a reference image is often unnecessary because [[ai_models_for_generating_photorealistic_images_and_ad_content | AI models]] have a strong understanding of their concepts and branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. However, for newer or smaller brands, providing a reference image is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

*   **Key Phrase**: Using "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" keywords is vital for generating photorealistic images, preventing the AI from defaulting to cartoonish styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Prompt Structure**: A detailed prose description of the desired image is effective.
    *   Example: "A female Runner is captured in mid stride running laterally in the for ground wearing her performance gear... behind stands the Egyptian desert with the pyramids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Additional Elements**: Specify font types (e.g., "exo2 bold italic"), color styles, and aspect ratios within the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Result**: A creative ad featuring a woman running with pyramids in the background, shaped like the Adidas logo, demonstrating capabilities previously impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Example 3: Athletic Greens
This ad demonstrates recreating a competitor's ad using their product imagery.
*   **Process**: An original Rise ad was used as a reference, combined with Athletic Greens product imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Prompt**: "Recreate this ad for ag1. Adjust the background to better fit athletic green Style. Change the price... to $110 SL out to $85 now. Generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Tip**: Explicitly stating "generate the image" prevents the AI from generating descriptive text instead of an image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Ethical Consideration**: While it may feel "dirty" to replicate a competitor's ad that cost significant time and money, this practice is common in the industry through inspiration sources, templates, and now, [[ai_models_for_generating_photorealistic_images_and_ad_content | AI]] tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### Example 4: Ridge Wallet (Changing Concepts)
This example shows how [[ai_models_for_generating_photorealistic_images_and_ad_content | AI]] can change the concept of an existing ad.
*   **Process**: A Black Friday ad for a Ridge wallet was used as a reference. The product image was swapped to a green Ridge wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Prompt**: "Swap it out and change it to a Christmas style ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Result**: The AI generated a Christmas-themed ad for the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Implication**: This capability allows for highly personalized and timely advertising, capitalizing on holidays, birthdays, or even real-time news cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. For instance, an ad could be generated for a company like Rippling, reacting to a news event with clever copy and a unique style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

## Sora for Prompt Inspiration
Sora, which uses the same underlying model as ChatGPT, offers an "explore page" where users can view images and their corresponding prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This serves as an excellent resource for:
*   Understanding effective prompting techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   Ideation and sparking creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   Finding existing ad examples to remix or adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
Sora is also noted for having less strict policy guidelines and potentially better photorealism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Prompting Best Practices
*   **Clarity and Directness**: Be very clear and direct in what you want the AI to generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **New Chat for Adjustments**: If an initial prompt doesn't yield the desired result, start a new chat for adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to a "recycle of worse and worse" images because the AI uses its own generated (and potentially flawed) image as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Starting fresh ensures the AI references original inputs.
*   **Specify Dimensions**: While AI models often default to common aspect ratios (e.g., 9x16), you can specify dimensions like 1x1 or 9x16 for different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

## Finding Ad Inspiration
Several tools gather and categorize ads from platforms like Meta's ad library, providing inspiration and templates:
*   Creative OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>
*   ForPlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   Icon.me <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>

## Live Demo: LCA Ad Creation
A live demonstration of [[using_ai_for_design_and_branding | creating an ad]] for "LCA," a design agency specializing in [[using_ai_tools_for_asset_and_ui_generation | AI interfaces]] and [[generating_content_with_ai_tools | AI-first products]], showcased the iterative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>:

1.  **Gathering Assets**: Screenshots of the company's logo, brand typography, client list (Dropbox, Salesforce), and general aesthetic were taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
2.  **Choosing Inspiration**: A vintage Rolex ad was selected as a reference to convey a "luxury vibe" for the agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.
3.  **Initial Prompting**:
    *   **Prompt**: "Generate a digital ad for LCA (Lay Checkout Agency). LCA is a SWAT team design agency only for the most interesting brands on the planet helping them with building AI first tools it only works with the best companies. I have provided some screenshots from their website for you to use as inspiration the ad as well as a reference vintage Rolex ad as inspiration use this to capture the luxury Vibe of the company. Generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.
    *   **Result 1**: The AI generated an ad featuring a man pointing with a watch (interpreted from the Rolex ad), good copy ("Leaders at billion dollar Brands choose LCA to Define their future"), and the LCA logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. The AI, however, generated a specific watch brand despite not being prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.
4.  **Refining with New Chat**: To replace the watch with company logos and avoid inheriting flaws from the first AI-generated image, a new chat was started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.
    *   **Prompt**: "Rather than generating a watch show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
    *   **Result 2**: The AI produced an ad with the LCA logo, a subheading "Design for the AI age," and logos of companies LCA works with (including an unworked-with Disney logo, highlighting occasional AI hallucination) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. The man's pose changed from pointing to showing his fist.
5.  **Further Refinement**: To guide the AI more precisely, subsequent prompts could specify elements like the man's pose, exact logos to include by name, or text placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

This process demonstrates how [[utilizing_ai_for_marketing_strategies | AI]] can be used to generate diverse and highly targeted ads at scale, fostering more personal and entertaining content that helps brands stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

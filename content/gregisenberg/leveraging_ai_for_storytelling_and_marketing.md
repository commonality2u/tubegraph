This article explores [[integration_of_storytelling_and_ai_in_video_marketing | leveraging AI for storytelling and marketing]], focusing on how AI tools enable the creation of compelling content and innovative business models. Omar, a guest expert, showcases how to generate Disney-style images and videos, and discusses broader shifts in business and marketing driven by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Power of AI for Storytelling and Marketing

Marketing fundamentally revolves around storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. AI tools like Leonardo AI and Cling AI allow users to create incredible content, such as Disney-style images and Pixar-like scenes, which can drive significant revenue for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Omar highlights his personal obsession with AI avatars, having used AI with his children to create images since ChatGPT first launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. By understanding these tools and effective prompting, individuals can build full workflows and generate business ideas without needing any employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Transformative Shifts in Business with AI

Omar identifies three major shifts in business, accelerated by events like COVID-19 and the advent of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>:

*   **Technical Shift (Product)**:
    *   Traditionally, launching a tech product required raising VC capital, years of development, and hiring expensive software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   With AI, products can now be built instantly at low cost and with zero employees, eliminating the need for large engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

*   **Audience Shift (Marketing)**:
    *   Traditional marketing involved social media budgets, creative teams, agencies, and "seasonal big campaigns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   The rise of solopreneurs (e.g., Peter Levels, Danny Postma, Marc Lou) and "always-on marketing" has transformed audience engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This approach emphasizes transparency, showing daily progress, and engaging audiences through continuous storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Even large organizations like WWE have adopted this "behind the curtain" marketing style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

*   **Cultural Shift (Operations)**:
    *   Historically, businesses relied on physical office spaces and hiring local talent for productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
    *   Remote working has become standard, allowing access to global talent and reducing office overheads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Leaner teams build faster, significantly shortening product cycles and reducing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Sequential Prompting for AI Content Creation

Omar introduces "sequential prompting" as a powerful technique, where ChatGPT is used to generate prompts for other AI tools, creating a multi-step workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Process of Sequential Prompting

1.  **Initial Prompt with Image Reference**: Start by giving ChatGPT an image (e.g., a child's photo) and basic details (name, age, gender) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. The prompt also guides ChatGPT on the desired output style (e.g., Disney/Pixar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
2.  **ChatGPT Generates a Detailed Prompt**: ChatGPT analyzes the image and uses the provided template to generate a detailed character description and a specific prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This output prompt ensures consistency for the character across different images or stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
3.  **Image Generation with Leonardo AI**: The generated prompt is then fed into an image generation AI tool like Leonardo AI. This tool creates high-resolution images based on the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. Leonardo AI also has an API for programmatic image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
4.  **Animation with Cling AI**: The generated images can be taken to Cling AI, which animates static images into short video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. Cling AI also offers a "dub" feature to lip-sync characters to spoken words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. Cling AI also provides an API for programmatic use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.
5.  **Voiceovers with ElevenLabs**: Additional tools like ElevenLabs can be integrated for voiceovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
6.  **Automation and User Experience**: This entire sequence can be automated using tools like Zapier or Make, or by connecting APIs programmatically with custom code. Developing a user-friendly front-end (e.g., with Webflow or Framer) can enhance the product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

## Business Opportunities from AI Storytelling

The capabilities of AI for content creation open up numerous business avenues, including:

*   **AI-First Personalized Greeting Cards (Moonpig 2.0)**: Inspired by Moonpig.com's success ($400 million revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>, an AI-first version could create personalized cards or GIFs with custom AI avatars of people and dynamic scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. ChatGPT can generate a business plan for such a venture, including revenue streams (premium sales, monthly memberships, upsell gifts) and technology stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.
*   **Personalized Children's Books (Teeny Tales)**: Creating custom storybooks where children can be protagonists in AI-generated imagery and narratives, similar to "Hoay Heroes" but with AI-driven illustration, significantly reducing overheads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.
*   **Memefication of Moments**: Using AI to quickly generate cartoon or Pixar-style memes from trending topics or personal photos for social media or group chats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. This can also serve as an [[leveraging_ai_for_content_creation_and_seo | indirect marketing strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   **AI-Generated Stickers**: Creating personalized "kiss-cut" stickers featuring AI-generated avatars of individuals (e.g., teachers, students) with custom messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. This can be automated by combining AI image generation (Leonardo AI) with background removal (Remove.bg) and print-on-demand APIs (Printful) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
*   **Educational Content**: Developing engaging, AI-powered educational systems based on school curricula, creating visual stories and images around historical events or specific topics to make learning more interactive for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. This could be a B2B model selling to schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>.

These opportunities emphasize that while core AI models are powerful, the true value lies in creating specific user experiences and brands around them, building unique products that cater to niche demands and offer significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. This forms part of the broader discussion on the [[future_of_media_and_storytelling_with_ai | future of media and storytelling with AI]] and the [[future_of_marketing_with_ai | future of marketing with AI]].

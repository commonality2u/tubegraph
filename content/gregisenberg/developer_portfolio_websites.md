The concept of creating specialized portfolio websites for developers was proposed by Danny Grant as part of a list of 139 startup ideas she shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This idea is positioned as "idea number two" from her list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## The Core Idea: Format.com for Developers
The main premise is to "help every developer create their own Danny town," which is presumed to be Danny Grant's personal portfolio website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The inspiration comes from Format.com, a platform that serves as a portfolio builder for creative professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The suggestion is to build a similar platform specifically tailored for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

While GitHub exists and serves as a de facto portfolio for developers, it is not as visually appealing or "beautiful" as a platform like Format.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This presents an opportunity to create a more aesthetically focused portfolio builder for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Business Potential
Format.com is a substantial business, with over 50,000 paying users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Users pay $12 a month annually or $24 a month on a monthly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Assuming an average of $15 per month, this translates to roughly $750,000 in monthly recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

Website builders are considered "beautiful businesses" because once a user creates their site, they are unlikely to churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. They have high retention rates and generally do not cost much to operate once built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This model "works really well for different [[niche_websites_and_domains | niches]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Building Strategy
A recommended approach to build a developer portfolio website builder is:
1.  **Creator-Led Strategy**: Similar to how one might partner with influential product managers (like Lenny Rachitsky) for a product spec tool, a developer portfolio site could leverage influential developers with large followings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
2.  **Start with Bespoke Designs**: Begin by designing one "really awesome developer portfolio site" for an influential developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The goal is to create something unique and interesting that excites them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
3.  **Refine and Scale**: After refining the process with a few initial users, the product can be developed into a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and begin charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

An example of a successful bootstrapped website builder is Card.co, founded by a single developer in Tennessee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. It offers simple one-page websites for a low annual fee (around $9) but is used by millions of people, demonstrating the viability of [[niche_websites_and_domains | niche website builders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

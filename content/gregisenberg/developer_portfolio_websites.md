## The Idea
The concept of "Shopify for X" is extended to developer portfolio sites, suggesting a dedicated platform to help every developer create their own portfolio website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. This idea was proposed by Danny Grant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

The aim is to build a "format.com for developers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. While GitHub exists, it is noted that it's "not as beautiful as a format" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>, indicating a gap for aesthetically pleasing and highly customizable portfolio solutions for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

## Market & Opportunity
Format.com, a portfolio builder for [[developing_digital_products_for_creative_industries | creative professionals]], has over 50,000 paying users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. This demonstrates a significant market for specialized portfolio builders.

## Business Potential
*   **Pricing**: Format.com charges $15 a month annually or $24 a month monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue**: Assuming an average of $15 a month for 50,000 users, this type of business can generate $750,000 in monthly recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Low Churn**: [[no_code_marketplaces_and_tools | Website Builders]] are considered "beautiful businesses" because once a site is built, users are unlikely to churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

## Building Strategy
The recommended approach involves a [[successful_examples_of_newsletterbased_startups | Creator-led]] strategy:
1.  **Build one awesome site**: Start by designing and building a "really awesome developer portfolio site" for a few influential developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. This involves reaching out to developers and offering to design their unique portfolio site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
2.  **Refine the product**: Once refined through this initial work, the product can be developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
3.  **Engage influencers**: Get "influencer developers" on board to help promote the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
4.  **Develop MVP**: Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and begin charging for the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

This type of business is seen as a "great cash flow" idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

## Why Website Builders are a Good Business
Despite potentially seeming "so 1999," [[no_code_marketplaces_and_tools | website Builders]] work and work "really well for different niches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. An example given is Card.co, a bootstrapped one-person business that charges a low annual fee (around $9/year) but is used by millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

There is a significant market opportunity for consultants who can help businesses run Facebook and Google ads without being perceived as "douchy" agencies or overly expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Even simple Google ads can be challenging for companies and event organizers to set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Offering a basic package of Meta and Google search ads can be a game-changer for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Many businesses, small and large, either need [[importance_of_paid_ads_for_business_growth | paid ads]] or don't realize their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. The current market for ad services is often dominated by expensive agencies or individuals who convey a sense of distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. There's ample room for one-person ad consultants specializing in specific niches, such as hair salons or products for female owners, by avoiding the "rich person on the internet" persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

Being a Meta ads expert can be highly beneficial if one avoids presenting themselves in a way that is solely focused on getting rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Addressing Misconceptions About Paid Ads

Many believe that Meta ads are ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This often stems from negative experiences with unreliable service providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. However, Meta ads are particularly effective for audiences over 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. In the "Ventureland" startup culture, it's sometimes considered a status symbol not to run ads, but this perspective can hinder growth for smaller businesses and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. Ads provide an effective way to generate leads and monetize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Strategies for Offering Ad Services

Instead of a monthly fee, consultants can take a percentage of revenue generated through ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. For example, one could identify local events like yoga retreats that aren't full and offer to fill them using Facebook ads in exchange for a cut of each ticket sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This approach works well for products or events where the consultant has some interest or understanding, such as creative retreats, wellness, or design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Event owners often enjoy putting on events more than selling them, making them ideal clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

Advisory services can involve literally sitting with clients, opening the Meta dashboard, and showing them how to run ads and set up funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This often involves taking a cut of their revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## The Role of Funnels and Conversion in Ad Campaigns

Paid ads are crucial for [[strategies_for_growing_online_audiences | growing online audiences]] and getting clients, especially for one-person shows or small teams who cannot afford massive branding campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. The ability to "put money into the machine" to find people and then convert them is powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

While some suggest starting with [[techniques_for_leveraging_social_media_for_organic_growth | organic content]] to refine messaging before moving to paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, learning how to run ads is a valuable discipline to avoid feeling helpless when trying to sell a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

### Key Metrics and Tools

*   **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS):** Aim for a positive return, e.g., making $1.50 back for every $1 spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.
*   **Funnels:** These are constantly tweaked to increase conversions. An example funnel spent $86,000 on Facebook and Google ads in June, generating $252,000 in revenue, resulting in a 38% ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>. This specific funnel led to 339 call bookings, with 273 attendees and 65 sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Framer** and **ClickFunnels** are used for building landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. ClickFunnels is particularly useful for quick testing by non-developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
    *   **ConvertKit** helps manage email marketing campaigns based on audience segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.

### Typical Funnel Structure: Video Sales Letter (VSL) Funnel

A common and effective funnel type is the Video Sales Letter (VSL) funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.

1.  **Opt-in Page:** This is the first page, offering something of value (e.g., a free training video, a downloadable lead magnet like a PDF or even a physical book) in exchange for an email address and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. The ad's primary goal is to "sell" the idea of watching this free video or getting the lead magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
2.  **Video Training (VSL):** After opting in, users watch a free training video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. This video serves as a pitch, demonstrating the value of the training and what it's like to be trained by the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. Instead of directly selling a product at the end, the video encourages booking a free call with a coach to learn about full programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.
3.  **Call Booking:** The video leads to a calendar (e.g., Calendly) for booking free consultation calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. These initial steps are often "ROI negative" as the primary goal is lead generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
4.  **Sales Conversion:** During the call, the team aims to convert the lead into a paying customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.

### Book Funnel

Another effective funnel is a "book funnel," where Facebook ads promote a free or low-cost physical book (which might be a monetized lead magnet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. This often results in a loss of money at the initial step but helps acquire email addresses and details, which can then be used in later monetization campaigns like Black Friday sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.

## Conversion Rate Optimization and Email Marketing

Conversion rate optimization isn't just about landing page conversion; it involves tweaking every step of the funnel, from sales calls to video content and surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. Initial funnels are launched quickly, and then individual elements are refined over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.

Email marketing is a key component, with companies sending many emails, particularly during sales campaigns (e.g., Black Friday, summer sale, Prime Day, back-to-school) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. While unsubscribes occur, the goal is to maximize sales with the fewest unsubscribes, balancing promotion with providing value through free content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

### Attribution and the "Shadow Funnel"

Tracking exact conversions from every channel can be complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. It's often more practical to focus on overall company growth, P&L, and Facebook ad spend ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>.

A "shadow funnel" refers to the trust-building element of having high-quality free content (like YouTube videos) available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. When potential customers see an ad, they often research the company, and finding extensive, quality content makes them more comfortable engaging with the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.

## The Art of Copywriting

Copywriting, or the text used in ads and landing pages, is a critical and challenging aspect of building effective campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>. Small changes in copy can significantly impact conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

### Copywriting Hacks

1.  **Increase Status:** Good copy often implies that purchasing a product or service will increase the customer's status among their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>. Even in corporate training, demonstrating increased usefulness to colleagues enhances one's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.
2.  **Pain vs. Pleasure:** Copy can be framed to either:
    *   **Move away from pain:** Highlighting how the product solves a painful problem (e.g., "never get stuck without your podcast equipment again") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. This approach is often more effective during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.
    *   **Move towards pleasure:** Emphasizing the positive experiences or benefits of the product (e.g., beautiful design, great sound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. This is often more effective during prosperous economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>.

## Websites vs. Funnels

The core distinction is that a **website** functions like a business card, presenting all available information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. A **funnel**, however, is a step-by-step process designed to guide a stranger to become a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.

Running effective paid advertisement campaigns, particularly on platforms like Meta (Facebook) and Google, is highlighted as a powerful way to grow a business and generate leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Despite common misconceptions that these ads "don't work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, they can be a game-changer for many, especially those targeting older demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

## The Market for Ad Services

There's a significant unmet need in the market for non-intimidating, non-agency companies or solopreneurs who can help others run Facebook and Google ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Many small to large businesses require paid advertising services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, but the current market often presents options that are either too expensive (agencies) or perceived as untrustworthy (individuals focused on flashy displays of wealth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

A successful approach for an ad consultant involves:
*   **Targeted Verticals:** Focusing on specific niches, such as hair salons, female product owners, or creative Patreon accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Building Trust:** Avoiding the "douchy" persona common among some online marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Performance-Based Pay:** Offering to take a percentage of revenue from sales generated directly by the ads, rather than a fixed monthly fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Contacting yoga retreats that aren't full and offering to fill spots for a cut of each ticket sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

## Misconceptions About Paid Ads

Many businesses, especially in the "Ventureland" startup culture, view not running paid ads as a "status symbol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This perspective, often influenced by Silicon Valley trends, can be detrimental to small businesses or those selling niche products (e.g., yoga retreats, creative products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

However, paid ads are particularly effective for audiences over 40, a significant portion of the global population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. For small teams or solopreneurs who cannot afford massive branding campaigns (like TV ads or billboards), simple ad campaigns feeding into a well-designed sales funnel can lead to call bookings and client acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

## The Role of Sales Funnels

[[building_successful_sales_funnels | Sales funnels]] are crucial for converting strangers into customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. Unlike a website, which acts as a static business card, a funnel is a step-by-step process designed to guide a prospect through a journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.

### Key Components of a Funnel
*   **Opt-in Page:** The initial page offering something of value (e.g., a free training video, a downloadable guide, a physical book) in exchange for an email address or contact details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. The ad's primary goal is to "sell" the idea of engaging with this free offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Value Delivery (e.g., Video Training):** After opting in, the prospect receives the promised free content. This content serves as a pitch, giving them a sense of what it's like to be trained by the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
*   **Call to Action (e.g., Call Booking):** At the end of the value delivery, the funnel directs prospects to book a free call with a sales coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. This is where the funnel starts to move towards monetization.

### AJ&Smart's $10 Million Funnel Example

AJ&Smart uses a specific Video Sales Letter (VSL) funnel structure:
1.  **Facebook Ad:** Sells a one-hour free training on facilitation basics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.
2.  **Opt-in Page:** Sells the idea of watching the free training video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
3.  **Video Training:** Based on Russell Brunson's "Expert Secrets," it concludes by inviting viewers to book a free call with a career coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.
4.  **Call Booking:** Prospects book a call via Calendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.
5.  **Sales Calls:** The team converts these bookings into sales for programs, such as a $7,500 facilitation program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

**Performance Example (June):**
*   Total ad spend (Facebook & Google): $86,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>
*   Total revenue: $252,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>
*   Return on Investment (ROI): 38% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>
*   Call bookings: 339, with 273 people attending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>
*   Units sold: 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>

This funnel has been consistently running for over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

### Book Funnels

Another effective funnel type is the "book funnel," where ads promote a physical book. This serves as a "front end" to acquire email addresses and details, even if it's initially unprofitable, as physical product ads tend to perform well on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. These leads can then be nurtured through email campaigns for future monetization, such as a Black Friday sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.

## Optimizing Conversion and ROI

While specific attribution tracking tools exist (e.g., Hyros), a simpler approach is to focus on the overall monthly profit and loss (P&L) and the ROI of ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. It's assumed that high-quality free content (a "shadow funnel" or "Goodwill bucket") builds trust and makes prospects more receptive to entering a paid funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

Conversion rate optimization isn't just about the landing page; it involves continuous tweaking of every step in the funnel, including sales calls, video content, and surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

### Copywriting for Conversion

Copywriting (the text in ads and landing pages) is a critical component of successful funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
*   **Status-Based Copy:** Consider how the product or service can increase the user's status among peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. For example, learning something that makes one more valuable to colleagues increases professional status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.
*   **Pain vs. Pleasure:** Copy can either focus on moving people *away from pain* or *towards pleasure* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.
    *   *Away from pain:* Highlighting how a product solves a problem or prevents an undesirable situation (e.g., "Never get stuck in the airport without your podcast equipment again") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. This is often more effective in bad economic times or for education services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.
    *   *Towards pleasure:* Emphasizing the positive benefits or desirable outcomes of using a product (e.g., "how beautiful this thing is and how nice it sounds") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. More effective in prosperous times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>.

### Email Marketing

Email campaigns are essential for [[building_and_monetizing_lead_generation | monetizing leads]] collected through funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>. Companies like AJ&Smart send many emails, leading to unsubscribes, but they accept this as part of the process, aiming to maximize sales while managing unsubscribe rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. They utilize tools like ConvertKit to manage email lists and track engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.

## Starting with Ads

While some suggest [[creating_and_testing_product_demand_through_online_ads | experimenting with organic content]] first to dial in messaging before moving to paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, learning how to run ads is a valuable discipline. It provides a means to generate leads and sales without feeling helpless or having to "beg people to buy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. The ideal scenario is to do both: test messaging organically and then amplify it with paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

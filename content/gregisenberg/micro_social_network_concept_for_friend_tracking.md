From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

A concept for a micro social network is proposed, focusing on helping friends track each other's locations to facilitate real-world meet-ups and create shared experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. The idea addresses a gap in current social media platforms that have become broad and public, losing the intimacy of close friend connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

## Problem Identified

The problem stems from people moving to new cities and friends being spread out globally, especially post-COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. It's difficult to know when friends might be in the same city to arrange plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. Current solutions are insufficient:
*   **Instagram Status Updates** 90% of Instagram status updates in some feeds are just people sharing their city, indicating a clear desire for this feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Instagram may not have anticipated this as a primary use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   **Apple's Find My Friends** While used by many close friends, Apple's Find My Friends is described as "flat" and lacking depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

## The Anti-Social Network Approach

The proposed micro social network aims to be a minimalist tool that does "one thing really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. It seeks to fill a void for users who desire a closed-off network with close friends, as opposed to the increasingly public nature of platforms like Twitter and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

> [!note] Building Social Apps
> Creating a consumer social startup is considered "hard mode" because it's exceptionally difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. However, the advent of AI makes product creation faster, potentially reducing the need for large initial investments and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. Consumer social is often described as "oil and water," almost impossible to mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Inspiration: The [[reinventing_path_and_nostalgiadriven_social_networking | Path]] App

The concept is heavily inspired by [[reinventing_path_and_nostalgiadriven_social_networking | Path]], a private social network from 10-12 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   **Premise:** [[reinventing_path_and_nostalgiadriven_social_networking | Path]] was a private network for close friends and family, limiting connections to around 75 to 150 friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.
*   **[[reinventing_path_and_nostalgiadriven_social_networking | Dunbar's Number]]:** The 150-person limit on [[reinventing_path_and_nostalgiadriven_social_networking | Path]] was based on a sociology theory called [[reinventing_path_and_nostalgiadriven_social_networking | Dunbar's Number]], which posits humans can only maintain about 150 meaningful connections at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   **"Anti-Facebook":** [[reinventing_path_and_nostalgiadriven_social_networking | Path]] was the "anti-version of the current state of social networks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. It monetized by selling sticker packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.
*   **Reinvention:** The idea is to "reinvent [[reinventing_path_and_nostalgiadriven_social_networking | Path]] for today's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a> standards, making it shinier and more modern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

## Key Features & Monetization

The proposed app would:
*   **Automatic Location Updates:** Users could push a button to automatically update their location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   **Proximity-Based Feed:** A simple feed would show friends based on their proximity to the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
*   **Conversation Starter:** The core function is to spark conversations and enable meet-ups by showing where friends are, even if not exact GPS coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.
*   **User Contribution:** Encourage users to contribute information to spark discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.
*   **Monetization:** A subscription model of $20-$30 per year is suggested, building on [[reinventing_path_and_nostalgiadriven_social_networking | Path]]'s success with sticker packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. This could be a multi-million dollar bootstrap business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

### Time Capsules of Shared Memories
Another idea is to create "time capsules of shared memories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.
*   **Problem:** Shared albums are seen as where "memories go to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. Users often find themselves deep in old photos in their iCloud library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Allow users to share a curated, ephemeral "physical time capsule" of memories (photos, memorabilia) made with friends from trips or events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.
*   **Ephemeral Nature:** The memories should be ephemeral, allowing users to discard them after a day or two weeks, avoiding obligation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.
*   **[[reinventing_path_and_nostalgiadriven_social_networking | Nostalgia]]-Driven:** This concept draws inspiration from the app "Clout" (around 2013), which monetized on [[reinventing_path_and_nostalgiadriven_social_networking | nostalgia]] by sending reminders of past memories, leading to viral sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. While Clout lacked network effects and relied on sharing to other platforms, the demand for [[reinventing_path_and_nostalgiadriven_social_networking | nostalgia]] remains strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity:** There's an opportunity for something in between a text message photo and a physical photo album on a nightstand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>. "[[reinventing_path_and_nostalgiadriven_social_networking | Nostalgia]] is a hell of a drug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>, and this idea could put smiles on faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities

The primary challenge for any consumer social app is establishing network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. If users' friends aren't on the app, its utility diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. However, the desire for a closed-off, private network among close friends is certainly present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

> [!tip] Future Monetization
> A wild idea for future monetization suggests that a traditional SaaS subscription model might be replaced by users committing their anonymized personal data to train large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. This could allow users to "pay" for premium subscriptions with their data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

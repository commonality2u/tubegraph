The ability to [[creating_aigenerated_commercials | create ads with AI]] that perform well can significantly impact a business's profitability, leading to increased return on ad spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of mastering prompting skills for AI image models like ChatGPT-4o <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Key Tools and Capabilities

The discussion primarily focuses on using **ChatGPT-4o** and **Sora** for [[innovations_in_ai_image_generation_and_design | AI image generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

*   **ChatGPT-4o:** This multimodal language model understands intent and creativity well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Prompting is less crucial compared to pure image models, as it has a better grasp of straightforward instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. It excels at [[generating_brand_assets_with_ai | creating photorealistic images]] of different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Sora:** Uses the same underlying model as ChatGPT-4o but offers an "explore page" where users can view images and their corresponding prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This page serves as a valuable resource for understanding effective prompting techniques and ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Sora is also noted for having less strict policy guidelines and potentially better photorealism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Prompting Strategies for Effective Ads

The most important elements for [[developing_creative_ad_content_for_digital_platforms | creating good ads]] with ChatGPT-4o are **inspiration images** and **product images** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Leveraging Reference Images
Providing an inspiration ad and a custom product image allows for super consistent and reliable ad creation through edits and adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **When to Use Reference Images:** Always provide a reference image if your product is relatively new, small, or lacks significant online presence (millions of dollars in ad spend per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **When Not to Use Reference Images:** For well-known concepts, ideas, or brands (like Nike or Adidas), AI models have a strong understanding and can generate relevant images without a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Keywords and Specificity
*   **"Ultra realistic" or "photo realistic":** These keywords are crucial for ensuring the output images appear lifelike and avoid cartoonish or oddly colored defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Detailed Descriptions:** A strong, detailed prose description of the desired image is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Font Types and Styles:** For well-known fonts, the AI will have a decent understanding, allowing for manipulation of font types, color styles, and aspect ratios within the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Specific Instructions:** To avoid the AI generating text that describes the ad, specify "generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### Tips for Iteration and Refinement
*   **Clear and Direct Prompts:** Be very clear and direct in what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Start a New Chat for Adjustments:** If an initial prompt struggles, start a new chat for adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to worse results because the AI uses its own generated (and potentially flawed) image as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. New chats maintain consistency while allowing for improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratios:** AI usually defaults to 9x16, but users can specify other dimensions like 1x1 or 9x16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

Several examples demonstrate the power of AI in ad creation:

*   **Jones Road Beauty:** An inspiration ad was adjusted using a product image, with the AI successfully layering elements (woman at top, overlapping product, text below) as instructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Adidas (No Reference Image):** A detailed prose prompt was used to generate an ultra-realistic image of a female runner in the Egyptian desert with pyramids, showing how well the AI understands well-known brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Athletic Greens (AG1):** An existing Rise ad was recreated for AG1, adjusting background style, price, and placing product images effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This highlights how AI streamlines the common industry practice of using inspiration ads and templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Ridge Wallet (Concept Change):** An existing Black Friday ad for a Ridge wallet was transformed into a Christmas-style ad by swapping the product image and changing the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Rippling (New Cycle Ad):** An ad was created leveraging a recent news cycle event (Rippling deal controversy) in the style of an old Wall Street Journal newspaper ad, demonstrating AI's ability to quickly capitalize on trending moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. This allows companies to take advantage of short-term news cycle moments, which was previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

## Finding Ad Inspiration

Several platforms can be used to find inspiration for [[generating_brand_assets_with_ai | AI-generated ads]]:
*   **Sora Explore Page:** Excellent for understanding how effective prompts work and for ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Creative OS:** Offers inspiration and templating tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **ForPlay** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   **Icon.me:** Recently launched, integrates with Meta Ad Library to provide searchable, tagged inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

The goal is to find an aesthetic not yet used in your specific market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## The Future of AI in Advertising

The API availability of these AI tools will make [[generating_app_assets_using_ai_tools | generating ads]] trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. It will be possible to create hundreds of ads in minutes by simply providing a reference ad and different audience characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This capability allows for **experimentation at scale**, a crucial factor in [[developing_creative_ad_content_for_digital_platforms | creating ads that convert]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The ad itself is becoming the targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

This technology allows for:
*   **Hyper-Personalization:** Ads can become more personal, funny, and entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.
*   **Targeting Niche Moments:** Generating ads for specific, often humorous, holidays (e.g., National Hot Dog Day) or personal events like birthdays (e.g., "Happy Birthday, 30% off Ridge wallet") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **Real-time Responsiveness:** AI can watch news feeds (like Twitter) and automatically produce ads based on trending moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## Live Demo: Creating an Ad for LCA

During a live demonstration for LCA, a design agency for the AI age, the process involved:
1.  **Gathering Brand Assets:** Screenshots of the company logo, typography, and client list were used as inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
2.  **Selecting Inspiration:** A vintage Rolex ad was chosen for its luxury aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.
3.  **Crafting the Prompt:** The prompt included:
    *   Defining LCA as a "SWAT team design agency" for top brands building AI-first products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.
    *   Instructions to use the provided screenshots and the Rolex ad to capture a "luxury vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
    *   "Generate the image" to ensure visual output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.
4.  **Initial Result & Refinement:** The first attempt generated an ad with a man pointing, but it included a Rolex watch, indicating the AI interpreted "Rolex ad" as a literal brand inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.
5.  **Second Iteration (New Chat):** To refine, a new chat was started. The prompt was adjusted to "show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images" instead of generating a watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>.
6.  **Outcome:** The AI successfully replaced the watch with client logos, maintained the luxury vibe, and created a digital-style ad with appropriate copy, even though it hallucinated one client (Disney) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

This live example demonstrates that while initial attempts may not be perfect (often requiring two or three tries for less strict prompts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>, the process allows for rapid iteration and creative guidance. The ability to [[creating_and_manipulating_aigenerated_art | generate creative visual content]] and [[converting_longform_content_into_memes | memes]] quickly is a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

This era presents an incredible opportunity to [[using_ai_to_create_viral_content | create viral content]], ads, and creative assets that stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

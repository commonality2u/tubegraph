Affiliate marketing, despite sometimes having a negative reputation associated with "cheesy ads" for questionable products, is viewed as a way to capture the money an advertiser would otherwise make by taking a bit more risk for potentially greater reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Goals & Business Structure

The goal for any entrepreneur starting out is to make $100,000 to $200,000 a year, which serves as a "Launchpad" for building more significant businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. While traditional startups might have a technical founder, designer, and business person, today's landscape often requires an "idea gallery guy/gal" and a "funnel guy/gal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>. This means having someone dedicated to generating new [[profitable_startup_ideas | ideas]] and another person focused on optimizing the customer journey and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>.

## Affiliate Marketing Models

There are two main approaches to affiliate marketing discussed:

### 1. Creator Affiliate

This model involves leveraging a pre-existing audience, such as through a newsletter or social media, to promote products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

*   **Newsletters:** A large newsletter can generate significant income from a single affiliate mention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. The strength of this model lies in the "moat" around your audience, especially if it's direct-to-consumer like an email newsletter, as it provides a stable platform less vulnerable to algorithm changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
*   **Example: Athletic Greens (AG1):** One individual reportedly makes $40,000 to $60,000 per month from Athletic Greens commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. Athletic Greens previously offered 30% lifetime commissions, meaning if a customer signs up for a $100/month subscription, the affiliate receives $30 per month until the customer cancels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. This generous commission structure incentivizes influential figures like Sahil and Huberman to promote the product, differentiating the business model for an otherwise non-new product (greens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

### 2. Directory Affiliate

This model involves creating curated lists or directories of products/services and integrating affiliate links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

*   **Leveraging Curation:** In a world with overwhelming information, people seek curation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. Creating specialized directories, such as a "robot lawnmower review website" providing "wirecutter style" reviews, can be a profitable approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Programmatic SEO & AI:** There's an arbitrage opportunity with SEO and AI tools to create landing pages at scale based on what people are searching for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. One could aim to create "one directory a month in different topics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.
*   **Converting Traffic:** To mitigate reliance on search engine algorithms, it's crucial to convert a percentage of directory visitors (e.g., 6-10%) to an email list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>. This builds an audience directly accessible, protecting against potential changes in search engine behavior, such as AI scraping content without attribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.
*   **Startup Cost and Potential:** Starting an affiliate website, especially for a niche like robot lawnmowers, could cost "zero" and potentially generate "hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars" within a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. Such ventures are considered "Launchpad" businesses due to their potential for high returns with minimal initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Affiliate Businesses

*   **Scalability:** Digital affiliate businesses, such as review websites, are considered "relatively scalable" and could potentially generate $300,000 to $1 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.
*   **Risk:** While digital businesses like affiliate websites are often preferred over physical ones (e.g., a lawnmowing company) due to perceived lower risk and higher scalability, the physical business can be "easy to get going with" for a scrappy entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
*   **SEO Vulnerability:** A dependence on SEO or social media algorithms can make an affiliate business vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. However, SEO is expected to evolve rather than die, and building an email list can provide a buffer against algorithmic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.
*   **Team Structure:** Success in building and scaling such ventures often relies on a team, specifically an "idea gallery guy" and a "funnel guy," who can conceptualize and then efficiently execute and optimize the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>. Ideas need an owner to maintain momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.

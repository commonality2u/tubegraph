## Core Features and Capabilities

### User Interface and Prompting
Upon signing in with a Google account, users are directed to a default experience featuring a basic prompting interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. A "Prompt Gallery" provides a wide range of examples, from simple trip ideas to code optimization, showcasing the models' capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### Long Context Processing
A significant capability of AI Studio and the [[gemini_models_and_their_impact_on_ai_studio_functionality | Gemini models]] is their ability to process long context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. For instance, it can take a 30-minute video (e.g., a Natural History Museum tour) and process it using over 531,000 tokens to extract information, such as a list of museum exhibits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. This capability makes it possible to extract trapped data from media, enabling opportunities for [[applications_and_business_opportunities_with_ai_studio | building businesses]] like online directories or gaining intelligence from long audio formats like podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

### Gemini Models Overview
The AI Studio experience is powered by various [[gemini_models_and_their_impact_on_ai_studio_functionality | Gemini models]], including:
*   **Flash Models**: The 2.0 Flash model is more powerful and expensive than the lighter flashlight model, which has higher rate limits but is less intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.
*   **Pro Model**: An experimental variant and the most intelligent model available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.
*   **Gemma**: An open-source version of the models also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.
*   **Reasoning Model**: This model offers "New Frontier capabilities" and is available for free to developers in AI Studio or via an API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. It can "think" about tasks before generating a final output, displaying a "thoughts" category in the UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>. For example, it can take a basic Python code snippet and generate a comprehensive plan for a fully-fledged website, landing page, and SaaS application, including desired outcomes, code, structure, technology stack, and MVP functionality like user authentication and dashboard features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. This detailed thought process is akin to outlining an essay or code structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. The Reasoning Model can also provide complete code for these tasks, even if the initial prompt is not perfectly optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.

### Starter Apps
AI Studio provides simple "starter apps" to showcase diverse model capabilities, with all code available on GitHub for users to download, hack on, and power with free API keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>.

*   **Spatial Understanding**: This app demonstrates the model's ability to deeply understand objects and their visual representation in images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. It can dynamically overlay 2D bounding boxes and provide coordinates of objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. This capability unlocks [[applications_and_business_opportunities_with_ai_studio | business ideas]] such as:
    *   Identifying furniture in images for e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>
    *   Inventory management by snapping pictures or using real-time video feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>
    *   Monitoring parking garage utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>
    *   Satellite analysis to bound areas based on criteria (e.g., corn fields) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>
    It enables automation of service-based business tasks that previously required human effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.

*   **Native Function Calling**: This feature shows how AI Studio and [[gemini_models_and_their_impact_on_ai_studio_functionality | Gemini]] can [[integration_of_firebase_studio_with_google_ecosystem | connect existing products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>. An example includes linking AI Studio to the Google Maps API to create a "geoguesser" experience, taking users to historical locations based on prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>. This combination of products, historically separate, can lead to a "combinatorial explosion" of new [[applications_and_business_opportunities_with_ai_studio | business opportunities]] with relatively low development effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.

### Real-time Streaming with Multimodal Live API
The Multimodal Live API powers real-time streaming experiences, enabling AI co-presence where the AI can see and hear what the user does and provide relevant context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>. A [[demonstration_of_ai_studio_features_and_use_cases | demonstration_of_ai_studio_features_and_use_cases | demonstration]] showed the AI acting as a real-time pair programmer, providing suggestions and debugging assistance for Python code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>.

This feature is seen as the future of work, where an AI partner provides real-time value and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>. Users can enable tool integrations, such as code execution within a Python virtual environment and "grounding" to browse the internet for information, all within the product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>. This democratizes access to assistance, making complex tasks like [[building_apps_with_ai_tools | learning to code]] or [[integrating_various_ai_tools_for_video_creation | editing video]] more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:33:00">[27:33:00]</a>. The Multimodal Live API is available for free at audio.google.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>.

The following article details strategies for leveraging user-generated content (UGC) and TikTok's organic reach to drive app growth and monetization, drawing insights from Joseph Choy.

## Mastering TikTok for App Growth

Many apps are achieving millions of downloads by effectively utilizing TikTok, a platform that remains a "black box" for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Joseph Choy emphasizes that TikTok organic marketing is currently the largest underpriced distribution channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The cost of creating and distributing content on TikTok is extremely low, making it accessible for all types of consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The speaker points out that a company achieved four million downloads in 90 days and $3 million a month with an AI app, highlighting the potential of this channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Leveraging E-commerce Marketing Tactics for Apps

Many successful tactics for app growth on TikTok are adapted from the e-commerce space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. TikTok Shop launched in November 2022, leading to significant marketing innovation in the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Case Study: Tabs Chocolate
Tabs Chocolate, an e-commerce company, grew from zero to $10 million annually by using a strategy of mass UGC creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. They hired numerous teenagers, organized them in a Discord server, and mass-produced content daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The founder, Oliver, later pivoted to a micro-SaaS business focused on helping college students with homework, applying the same marketing tactics. This shift demonstrated how e-commerce content strategies could be applied to consumer SaaS, offering higher margins (90%+) compared to e-commerce (20-30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Content Format: TikTok Carousels
Contrary to the common perception that TikTok only features short-form video, many successful campaigns use carousels (slideshows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. While slideshows may convert at a lower rate due to less human connection than talking-head videos, they offer significantly greater scale and a lower barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

**Examples of Carousel Content:**
*   **Colostrum products:** Videos often use AI-generated images (e.g., Midjourney) and trending audio (e.g., Joe Rogan clips). They focus on common pain points like energy, brain fog, and metabolism, directing traffic to e-commerce sites like Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **POV app:** This disposable camera app utilizes wedding-themed stories, often with "strong negative hooks" (e.g., controversial wedding rules) and AI-generated faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. The last slide promotes the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

The key to these strategies is rapid experimentation. Once a content format works, it can be "spammed" daily, leveraging the platform's ability to respond to unpredictable consumer behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Using TikTok Shop Data for App Opportunities
The TikTok Shop Affiliate Center provides valuable data on high-volume products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. By filtering by industry (e.g., skincare, supplements) and performance (e.g., GMV), app developers can identify successful e-commerce creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

The opportunity lies in convincing these established TikTok Shop creators to promote apps instead of just e-commerce products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. These creators are skilled at making content that gets views and converts sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

**Strategy:** Create an app that helps creators sell their existing e-commerce products more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. For example, a skincare app could analyze a user's face and suggest products, allowing creators to demonstrate "before and after" transformations using the app as a utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. Influencers might use such an app for free if it aids their content creation, leading to free marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. This approach can be applied across many niches (e.g., makeup, fashion, sports) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

## User Acquisition and Monetization
Apps can achieve high volume with lower price points compared to physical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Many single-utility apps use a paywall model, where users onboard, answer questions, and then encounter a weekly or annual subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. The ease of iOS subscriptions, particularly with "Double Tap to Pay" for Apple Pay, has significantly boosted app revenue in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

Historically, app distribution was dominated by App Store featuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Today, TikTok and Instagram are the primary content discovery platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Gaining top-of-funnel distribution through TikTok can lead to higher App Store rankings and organic downloads via App Store Optimization (ASO), providing long-term benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

## Targeting High LTV Niches
While TikTok is often associated with a younger demographic, a wide range of demographics exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. Targeting niches with fewer creators means content is underpriced and can still reach affluent audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

**Niche Examples:**
*   **Golf:** Golfers are a high-value demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. An AI golf coach app that analyzes swings using the camera could provide tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. A top golf swing analysis app currently gets 10,000 downloads/month and makes $70,000/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. This offers a significantly cheaper and more convenient alternative to in-person coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
*   **MMA/Combat Sports:** The KO app helps users train for boxing and MMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. Its product demos feature a "wireframe skeleton" overlay that analyzes movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. This visual "wow factor" performs well on TikTok and could be applied to other sports like tennis, golf, or pickleball, using phone cameras and AI vision APIs (like GPT Vision) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.
*   **Poker:** Poker players are considered ideal customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. Many existing poker content videos on TikTok are unmonetized or under-monetized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. An app could analyze hand history, strategies, or offer educational tips for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. Briefly flashing an app interface during gameplay analysis videos could prompt audience questions and downloads via comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

## The Evolution of Influencer Marketing on TikTok
TikTok's "For You Page" (FYP) algorithm is content-based, not follower-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>. 95% of FYP content comes from new accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>. This means traditional influencer marketing (paying for audience reach) is less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

Instead, creators can be hired purely as actors, regardless of their follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. Brands can create new "brand accounts" for each creator to post content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. This strategy is cheaper and avoids issues with influencers disliking overt selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

**Algorithm Optimization:**
*   If a specific content format or face works well with an audience, creating new accounts dedicated to that format or person helps the algorithm serve content to the same audience consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>.
*   Putting too many faces or varied content types on a single account can confuse the algorithm and hurt reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. The focus should be on optimizing for the algorithm, not just aesthetic page appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>.

### Cult Movements and Product Development
Building apps around existing "cult-like" movements can lead to significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>. These movements often have deep roots and strong ideologies.

**Examples of Cult Movements:**
*   **Looksmaxing:** The UMAX app capitalizes on the "looksmaxing" movement, which focuses on improving physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. The app scans a user's face, provides scores, and offers tips for improvement (jawline, skin, hair) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. This movement taps into universal desires for relationships and self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **Wealth Creation:** Crayo partnered with YouTubers and TikTokers who teach teenagers how to make money online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>. Initially selling courses, Crayo now productizes the content creation process, automating the making of viral videos (e.g., Reddit Minecraft Parkour clips) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>. This taps into the "cult of money" and young ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>.

The framework for finding these ideas involves considering universal human desires: health, wealth, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.

## Importance of Product Quality
While distribution strategies are crucial, the underlying product must be high quality and resonate with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. Before scaling with millions of downloads, ensure the app is not "leaky" – meaning it retains users and provides value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>. Understanding user lifetime value (LTV) and customer acquisition cost (CAC) requires a product that maintains engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. A retentive product is essential for scalable growth; otherwise, it becomes akin to a one-time e-commerce sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>.

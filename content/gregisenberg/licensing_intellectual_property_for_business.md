Licensing intellectual property (IP) for business involves obtaining the rights to use an established brand or creative work for commercial purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. This strategy can be a powerful way to leverage existing recognition and affinity, rather than building a brand from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

## Benefits of Licensing IP
By licensing an established brand, businesses can gain significant advantages:
*   **Leverage existing recognition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.
*   **Marketing advantages**: An existing brand allows for immediate use in marketing efforts, such as running Facebook ads featuring a well-known name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

## Cost and Accessibility
The cost of obtaining licenses for intellectual property can be surprisingly affordable, particularly for nostalgic IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>. For example, a Star Wars license for an apparel line cost $50,000 for the first two years, plus a 2% or 3% sales percentage, which was much less than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.

## Examples of Licensed IP in Business
### Pokémon Sleep
Pokémon Sleep is an application that has successfully leveraged the Pokémon brand to [[gamification | gamify]] sleep habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. It reportedly makes $100 million annually from 9.8 million downloads, translating to roughly $10 per download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. The app's success is attributed to combining the nostalgia of Pokémon with the real-life goal of improving sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.

### Star Wars Apparel
An individual obtained a Star Wars license for an apparel line after attending an intellectual property licensing conference in Las Vegas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. This allowed them to use the Star Wars brand in their marketing and product offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

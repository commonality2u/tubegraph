[[Pricing strategies and subscription models | Pricing]] is often the least considered aspect in software, despite its critical importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. For [[building_a_vertical_saas_business | building a vertical SaaS business]], a scientific and mathematical approach to pricing is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

## Core Pricing Framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>

The fundamental approach to [[Pricing strategies and subscription models | pricing]] involves understanding the existing cost or value of the problem being solved for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>. The goal is to determine how much the customer is currently paying for the "thing" the software aims to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

## Value-Based Pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:51:59]</a>

SaaS products should focus on delivering clear, quantifiable benefits to the customer to justify their price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>. These benefits typically fall into four categories:
*   **Increasing Revenue** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>
*   **Decreasing Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>
*   **Preventing Customer Churn** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>
*   **Maintaining Compliance** (especially in highly regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>

If a product does not offer clear Return on Investment (ROI) in these areas, it becomes difficult to sell because businesses prioritize these outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.

### Example: Student Retention Tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>
A retention tool for trade schools was developed based on customer feedback about student dropouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>. The tool analyzes academic and attendance data to identify at-risk students in real-time, then automatically texts them with resources and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>.

To price this tool, the value was quantified:
1.  **Tuition Cost**: A student's tuition for a trade school program is approximately $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.
2.  **Current Retention Rate**: Schools had a retention rate of about 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.
3.  **Financial Impact**: Losing students meant millions of dollars in losses annually for the schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.
4.  **ROI Calculation**: By forecasting that the software could save just five students who were halfway through their program, the direct financial benefit to the school ($50,000) was evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.

This clear ROI allowed for a higher pricing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. The average uplift from the software was found to be about 3%, which could be translated into a specific dollar ROI for each business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. The product was then priced at less than half of the projected ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.

## Pricing Percentage of Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>

A common strategy is to ask for a portion of the money saved or generated for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>. A starting point for this percentage is often 50%, with adjustments made based on market feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.

## Importance of Owning the Transaction with Payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>

Adding payment processing capabilities to a vertical SaaS solution can significantly increase its potential market size and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>.
*   **Massive Scale**: By taking a percentage of every transaction that flows through the system, a company can tap into a much larger market than just subscription fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. For example, Toast, a restaurant software company, saw its market size expand from $120 million (from subscriptions) to potentially trillions by integrating payment processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.
*   **Convenience and Efficiency**: For the customer, using an integrated payment solution within their existing vertical SaaS app simplifies operations, reduces manual tasks (like exporting transaction records), and avoids financial reconciliation nightmares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. This provides a clear value proposition over disparate systems like PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.

While payments may not always be a "wedge product" (an initial, easy-to-adopt tool), it is a crucial component for [[building_a_vertical_saas_business | building massive vertical SaaS businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>. If a "wedge product" can be built that precedes or follows a transaction, it creates an opportunity to eventually capture and monetize the transaction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>.

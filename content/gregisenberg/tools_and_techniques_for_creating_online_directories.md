Frey, an experienced online directory builder, teaches a method for creating online directories that can generate significant passive income with minimal weekly effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. His approach focuses on building a simple, evergreen, and location-based directory that can achieve a monthly recurring revenue of $2,000 to $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This method emphasizes finding and validating a niche, utilizing tools for data collection and enrichment, and structuring the website for optimal search engine optimization (SEO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Understanding the Directory Model

Frey's directories differ from typical expectations of modern, map-based directories, opting for a simpler, more static approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. His first directory, built in October 2022, has been monetized for 18 months, requires about 15 minutes of maintenance per month, and generated around $2,300 in revenue in a recent month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. While AI tools are recommended for some parts, they are not strictly necessary to get started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Examples of Successful Directories

*   **RoadsideAmerica.com**: A directory of quirky roadside attractions in the United States, receiving 85,000 monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. It monetizes through display ads, with 96% Tier 1 traffic, and is estimated to make $5,000-$7,000 per month passively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **AtlasObscura.com**: A worldwide directory of off-the-beaten-path attractions, boasting 1 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. It monetizes primarily through display ads (AdSense) and also sells a book, estimated to make $30,000-$60,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **FindAGrave.com**: A directory for finding burial sites, receiving 1.4 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. With 92% Tier 1 traffic, it monetizes through AdSense and is estimated to make $60,000-$100,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

These examples highlight that even "ugly" or "boring" websites can be highly profitable due to their niche and traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

## Key Techniques for Building a Profitable Directory

Frey's preferred directories are "evergreen and location-based," meaning they don't require frequent data updates, making them ideal for passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### 1. Finding and Validating a Niche [[Validating and Testing Directory Ideas]]

The process begins with identifying a viable niche:
*   **Keyword Research (Ahrefs)**: Use Ahrefs Keyword Explorer to search for "near me" queries, looking for a long list of local searches with high search volume and low keyword difficulty (KD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
    *   **Target KD**: While anything under 20 is generally easy, Frey has successfully targeted keywords with KD 40-50, and even 70, on fresh domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
    *   **Search Volume**: Frey's "sweet spot" is 30,000 to 100,000 monthly searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   **Avoid These Niches**:
    *   **Seasonal Niches**: Websites that monetize well only for a month (e.g., "pumpkin patches near me") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   **Difficult-to-Get Data**: Niches where data acquisition is challenging (e.g., "earthquake near me") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
    *   **Big Branded Keywords**: Companies likely already have optimized directories or the search intent is too "one-dimensional" (e.g., "Taco Bell near me") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Look for Multi-Dimensional Search Intent**: Choose niches where users are looking for specific types or features within a category. For example, "dog parks near me" is good because users might search for "indoor dog park," "off-leash dog park," or dog parks with specific amenities like water fountains, benches, or shade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. This allows for data enrichment and more useful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### 2. Competitive Research

*   **Google Search**: Type in the niche keyword (e.g., "Dog Park Los Angeles") and scroll through the first page results to identify existing directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
*   **Identify Improvement Opportunities**: Analyze competitors' directories. Look for areas where you can build something better by offering more features or a more comprehensive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Even basic competitors with significant traffic (e.g., 21,000 monthly visitors) indicate a strong opportunity for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
*   **Leverage Google Maps Gaps**: If Google Maps isn't fully satisfying user needs, it's a good sign for a directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

### 3. Validating the Problem (Social Listening)

*   **Reddit**: Use Reddit to confirm that the identified problem is worth solving. Search for your niche (e.g., "Dog Park Los Angeles Reddit") to find forums where people are discussing difficulties or needs related to the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.
*   **Sentiment Analysis**: Skim through discussions and comments to gauge user sentiment. Look for direct requests for curation or hyper-specific features, which serve as strong social signals that a problem exists (e.g., a Reddit post about Google Map pins for dog parks showing a desire for descriptions and photos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude can be used for sentiment analysis of compiled links, but manual review is also effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

### 4. Data Collection

*   **Web Scraping Tools**: Frey uses OutScraper (specifically, the Google Map Scraper) to collect data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.
*   **Google Maps Categories**: Before scraping, verify if a dedicated Google category exists for your niche (e.g., "dog park") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. Using an "exact match" category simplifies data collection and reduces junk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
*   **Plain Queries**: If no exact category exists, use a "plain query" (e.g., "off-leash dog parks"), but be prepared for a larger dataset with more junk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>.
*   **Essential Data Parameters**: When scraping, select key parameters like name, phone number, address, street, postal code, state, reviews, street view, working hours, and especially the "location link" for future data enrichment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.
*   **Cleaning Junk Data**: For large datasets with junk (common with plain queries), manual parsing is often preferred to preserve quality listings. This involves deleting listings without addresses or with very few reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. While AI can assist, it might inadvertently remove good data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

### 5. Data Enrichment

This is a critical step to differentiate your directory and make it more useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.
*   **Identify Desired Features**: Based on keyword research (e.g., "indoor dog park," "off-leash dog park") and reviewing Google Maps comments and tags, identify common features or amenities users seek (e.g., water fountains, shade, benches, dog bags, trash cans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
*   **Manual Enrichment (Initial Approach)**: Initially, Frey manually added columns to his data sheet for each feature and marked "yes" or "no" for each listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>. This is tedious for large datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.
*   **Automated Enrichment (Advanced)**: Frey is developing a tool that uses the Google location ID (from the scraped location link) to automatically read Google URLs, scan reviews, and determine if specific features are present (e.g., "Does this dog park have shade?"). This saves significant time compared to manual enrichment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>.

### 6. Implementation & Website Structure [[Generating websites and directories with minimal effort]]

*   **Content Management System (CMS)**: While WordPress (using themes like Elementor Pro) is a basic option, other modern CMS like Framer or Bolt.new can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>.
*   **Static Pillar Page Directory (Recommended for Beginners)**: This is Frey's preferred "level one" directory build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.
    *   **Structure**: A single, very long, comprehensive page that incorporates all content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.
    *   **Elements**:
        *   Header (H1) with the main keyword (e.g., "Dog Park Los Angeles") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.
        *   Table of contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>.
        *   City-specific sections targeting keywords (e.g., "Dog Park Long Beach") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>.
        *   Individual listings with photos, enriched data (features), basic information (address, phone, hours), and embedded maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. Reviews can be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.
    *   **SEO Advantage**: This format leverages "pillar page" SEO principles, allowing a single page to rank for numerous keyword clusters (e.g., a state page ranking for 1,300 keywords) by targeting high-volume location-based queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. Location pages are typically the most searched pages on directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.
    *   **Internal Linking**: A simple internal linking strategy at the bottom of the page encourages users to click on different states or regions to explore more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies [[Monetizing Online Directories]] [[Monetization strategies for directory sites]]

Beyond display ads, online directories offer diverse income opportunities:
*   **Display Ads**: Ideal for long pillar pages due to multiple ad placement opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
*   **Selling Products**: Such as a physical book (e.g., AtlasObscura.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Building Software/SaaS**: Using the directory to drive traffic to a relevant software product (e.g., a farm directory funneling traffic to a farm management SaaS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. AI can help build this software instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Plays**: Partnering with relevant businesses (e.g., BarkBox for a dog park directory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   **Lead Magnets/Data Collection**: Building an email list or collecting data on users (e.g., dog owners for a dog park directory), which can be highly valuable (as seen with BarkBox's acquisition based on data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>.
*   **Selling Leads**: Programmatic directories can sell leads to service-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.

Online directories are considered underrated, offering a strong foundation for both lifestyle businesses (providing "mailbox money" to cover bills) and larger ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. Regardless of the scale, the initial steps of finding, validating, and parsing data remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>.

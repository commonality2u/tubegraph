## What is a Funnel?

A funnel is defined as a step-by-step process designed to guide someone from being a stranger to becoming a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:50">[04:49:50]</a>. This contrasts with a website, which is typically described as a business card that simply lists available offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:42">[04:49:42]</a>. The focus of a funnel is to convert prospects through a structured journey.

## The Role of Paid Advertising
[[effective_use_funnels_in_business_growth | Paid ads]] are considered one of the best ways to build and grow a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:01">[06:59:01]</a>. Despite common misconceptions, Meta (Facebook) and Google ads can be game-changers for companies, especially when simple setups are offered as a basic package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>.

### Market Gap for Ad Consultants
There is a significant market opportunity for consultants who help small businesses run Facebook and Google ads without being overly expensive agencies or having an intimidating, "douchy" presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. Many businesses believe paid ads don't work because their experience has been with scammy individuals or unresponsive agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

Instead of charging a monthly fee, consultants could take a percentage of the revenue generated from ticket sales or leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>. This approach makes it easier to start, particularly for events like yoga retreats or creative workshops, where event owners often dislike the selling aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>.

### Debunking the "Ads are Dead" Myth
The notion that Meta ads are ineffective is often due to a misunderstanding of their target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. While younger demographics might not engage as much, Meta ads perform exceptionally well for people over 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. Businesses should consider that their target audience might be active on platforms even if they personally are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>.

There's a perceived "status symbol" in some business circles, particularly in "Ventureland," to boast about not running paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>. This mentality, often adopted from Silicon Valley's focus on "cutting edge" marketing, can be detrimental to small businesses that don't have large funding or established personal brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>. For many, ads provide an easy way to start generating leads and clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>.

## Building a Sales Funnel: A Practical Example
A common and effective funnel structure, often referred to as a VSL (Video Sales Letter) funnel, includes several key stages:

1.  **Opt-in Page:** The first page aims to capture an email address by offering something of value, such as a free training video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:00">[29:39:00]</a>. The ad itself sells the opt-in page, and the opt-in page sells the idea of watching the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:48:00">[30:48:00]</a>. This free offering can also be a downloadable lead magnet like a PDF or even a physical book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>, which can work particularly well with Facebook ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>.
2.  **Free Training Video:** This video, often based on a structured format (like the "Expert Secrets" book), provides valuable training and acts as an extended pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:56:00">[32:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20:00">[31:20:00]</a>.
3.  **Call Booking:** Instead of directly selling a product at the end of the training, the video encourages booking a free call with a sales coach to discuss further training opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:03:00">[33:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:53:00">[33:53:00]</a>.

### Tools Used
*   **Framer:** For visually appealing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:00">[32:07:00]</a>.
*   **ClickFunnels:** For quick setup and testing, especially by non-technical team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:16:00">[32:16:00]</a>.
*   **ConvertKit:** For email marketing and audience segmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:58:00">[38:58:00]</a>.

### Performance Metrics
A typical funnel example showed:
*   Monthly ad spend (June): $80,000 on Facebook, $6,000 on Google/YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>.
*   Total ad spend: $86,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:00]</a>.
*   Total revenue: $252,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[35:20:00]</a>.
*   Return on Investment (ROI) from ads: 38% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>.
*   Call bookings: 339 total, with 273 people attending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>.
*   Sales: 65 units of a workshop/master program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:54:00">[35:54:00]</a>.

### Monetization and Lead Nurturing
Leads generated through funnels, even if not immediately monetized (e.g., through free book offerings), can be nurtured for future campaigns like Black Friday sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:12:00">[38:12:00]</a>. This involves extensive email marketing, which may lead to unsubscribes, but is managed by focusing on sales and accepting that some people will opt out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:03:00">[39:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:00">[40:11:00]</a>.

## Optimizing Funnels for Conversion
[[how_to_improve_conversion_rates_using_funnels | Optimizing funnels]] is an ongoing process that involves constant tweaking and obsession with Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>. It's not just about the landing page conversion rate; it includes optimizing every step, from sales calls to the content of videos and surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>.

### Starting with Organic Content
Before diving into paid ads, it's beneficial to test messaging with organic content (e.g., on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn) to see what resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. This acts as "training wheels" to refine messaging for both social media and landing pages before committing to paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>.

### The "Shadow Funnel" and Trust Building
While direct conversion tracking tools like Hyros exist, a simpler approach is to focus on overall profit and loss (P&L) and the ROI of ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31:00">[41:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:00">[42:02:00]</a>. The existence of high-quality, free content (e.g., a YouTube channel with hundreds of hours of content) acts as a "shadow funnel" that builds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:27:00">[42:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:31:00">[40:31:00]</a>. When people see an ad, they often verify the business's legitimacy online, and a strong organic presence makes them more comfortable entering the paid funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:29:00">[42:29:00]</a>.

### Goodwill Bucket
Maintaining a "goodwill bucket" of free content ensures that even when aggressively pushing sales campaigns, there's a balance of value provided to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>.

## The Art of Copywriting
Copywriting—the text used in ads, landing pages, and emails—is crucial for [[how_to_improve_conversion_rates_using_funnels | funnel performance]] and is considered one of the hardest parts of the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:38:00">[43:38:00]</a>.

### Copy Hacks
1.  **Status Increase:** Copy should subtly or directly imply that the product or service will increase the user's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:39:00">[44:39:00]</a>. For example, learning something that makes one more valuable to colleagues increases professional status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:11:00">[45:11:00]</a>.
2.  **Pain vs. Pleasure:** When writing headlines or body copy, decide whether to emphasize moving the customer away from pain or towards pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:00:00">[46:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Moving Away from Pain:** Focuses on alleviating current problems or preventing negative situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:15:00">[46:15:00]</a>. This is often more effective during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:01:00">[47:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Moving Towards Pleasure:** Highlights the positive benefits and desirable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:00">[46:51:00]</a>. This tends to perform better in prosperous economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:24:00">[47:24:00]</a>.

These hacks are based on principles from old-school marketing and copywriting experts, whose insights remain highly relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:50:00">[47:50:00]</a>.

## Further Considerations
*   **Specific Verticals:** There's a significant opportunity for one-person ad consultants to specialize in specific industries, such as hair salons or products for female entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   **[[utilizing_seo_and_data_for_product_development | SEO]] and [[domain_strategies_for_lead_generation | Domain Strategy]]:** While ads are powerful, organic visibility is also crucial. Companies like boringmarketing.com specialize in helping businesses rank high on Google through SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Creating niche websites based on specific search terms and monetizing through affiliate links is also a potential strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:05:00">[49:05:00]</a>.

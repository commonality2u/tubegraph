Brett from Designjoy, a one-person designer generating millions, utilizes AI to produce striking designs. The ease with which these tools can be used to generate beautiful graphics is surprising, as there is "no kind of magic behind the scenes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## AI Tools for Design: An Overview

The current phase of generative AI encompasses various realms, including image generation and video generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For those new to AI creation, an easy entry point is tools like Higsfield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Higsfield: A Simplified Approach to Video Creation

Higsfield provides templates that simplify the process of telling AI what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. One of the challenges with AI is knowing how to communicate with it, especially for non-directors who may not understand cinematic terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Higsfield addresses this by offering preset actions and effects, allowing users to select a template, upload a product image, and generate a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

Higsfield can:
*   Take into consideration the product's can and branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   Swap out models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   Maintain text on the product, overcoming a previous "problem child of AI generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   Generate quick videos for advertisements like Instagram ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

While Higsfield is an excellent starting point, the "real fun" for advanced creative work lies with [[AIassisted writing processes and frameworks | ChatGPT]] and [[Midjourney AI Design Overview | Midjourney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Integrating [[Midjourney AI Design Overview | Midjourney]] and [[AIassisted writing processes and frameworks | ChatGPT]]

It can generate realistic image prompts that [[Midjourney AI Design Overview | Midjourney]] might struggle with directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

The effectiveness of these systems depends on the prompt or reference image provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Understanding [[Midjourney AI Design Overview | Midjourney]]'s Prompting System
[[Midjourney AI Design Overview | Midjourney]] operates on a simple prompt system where users tell it what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Key components include:
*   **Image Prompts**: Inserting a photo allows [[Midjourney AI Design Overview | Midjourney]] to generate new images that incorporate elements from the reference photo (e.g., a person, surfboard, greenery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Style References**: Uploading a style reference image ensures that any generated image will adopt its colors, shadows, highlights, and depth of field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Users can also mix different style references for unique generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### [[AIassisted writing processes and frameworks | ChatGPT]] as a Prompt Generation Tool
Historically, prompting was a specialized skill requiring "author level skills" to visualize and describe desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. However, [[AIassisted writing processes and frameworks | ChatGPT]] has made prompting accessible to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

[[AIassisted writing processes and frameworks | ChatGPT]] is highly effective at generating detailed prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. For example, a simple request like "I want to write some image prompts to generate a zoomed in photo of a cowboy in the back of a horse riding the rains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a> can yield multiple well-crafted options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. [[AIassisted writing processes and frameworks | ChatGPT]] can expand on minimal input, adding rich details that enhance the final image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. It can also "dream up" entire collections of related scenes, ensuring consistency across a series of images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

The process for creating AI art typically involves:
1.  Having a basic idea of what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
2.  Prompting [[AIassisted writing processes and frameworks | ChatGPT]] to generate several detailed prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
3.  Plugging these prompts into [[Midjourney AI Design Overview | Midjourney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

*   **Runway**: Used to add motion to images, effectively turning them into videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. [[AIassisted writing processes and frameworks | ChatGPT]] can generate prompts to instruct Runway on what elements to move within an image (e.g., "soft ripples in the water, have the smoke coming, have the trees blowing softly in the wind") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Runway is known for its high-quality output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Cling**: Another image-to-video tool that allows for start and end frames, enabling seamless looping of videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Cling also offers AI-generated sound options based on the video context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Magnific Upscaler**: Enhances images to reveal "super rich details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Photoshop**: Can be used for "generative fill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Video Editing Tools**: Simple tools can stitch together multiple 10-second video clips (by saving the last frame of one video as the starting image for the next) to create continuous shots of any desired length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   **Cap Cut**: A user-friendly video editing platform for adding text layers on top of generated videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

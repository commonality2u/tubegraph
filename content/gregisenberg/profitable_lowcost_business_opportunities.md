Many wealthy individuals achieve success through "boring, sweaty businesses" rather than high-tech ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," champions this approach, emphasizing that increasing one's odds of getting rich often involves doing something "normal" or "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Boring Businesses

While many entrepreneurs focus on tech startups, AI, and raising money in Silicon Valley, Huber points out that many truly wealthy people he knows built their fortunes in less glamorous sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Examples include:
*   Underground utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Surveying companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   HVAC businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Real estate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

The key is to compete in markets where the competition is less sophisticated or slower to adapt, increasing the odds of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

## Nick Huber's Journey: From Student Storage to Self-Storage

Huber's personal journey exemplifies the "sweaty startup" model. He started a pickup and delivery storage business called Storage Squad, which served students returning home for the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Origin:** The idea came when someone offered to store their items in his apartment instead of leasing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapped Growth:** The business was bootstrapped with minimal investment, using sidewalk chalk as the main marketing tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> and cheap used cargo vans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Financial Success:** Storage Squad reached $2.2 million in annual revenue, with $400k-$500k in profit per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. It was sold in 2020 for $1.75 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Real Estate Expansion:** Leveraging this success, Huber and his partner invested in self-storage facilities. One facility bought for $625k in 2019, generating $4,000/month, had over a hundred abandoned units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Another in North Georgia, purchased for $1.5 million doing $16,000/month, now generates $40,000/month and is worth $4.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Examples of Profitable Low-Cost Business Ideas

Huber highlights several [[successful_business_ideas_outside_of_tech | successful business ideas outside of tech]] that offer substantial profits with relatively low startup costs or easily understood operations.

### Service-Based Businesses

*   **Lawn Care Company:** Huber's brother runs a lawn care company using bandit signs for marketing, acquiring 30-40 new customers annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. He earns over $100,000 yearly working nine months, allowing him to spend two months fishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Mobile Detailing Business:** One individual, Jack from "Detailed Dogs," earned $10,000 in profit on $17,000 revenue in October 2024, projecting $120,000 annually just one year out of college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **High-End Transportation:** A friend with three drivers in Atlanta provides luxury airport transportation and performs well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Tree Removal:** While requiring expensive equipment and skilled employees, tree removal is highly profitable. Two workers completing a four-hour job can earn over $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Christmas Light Installation:** Friends of Huber pay $3,500-$4,000 for Christmas lights to be installed for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Power Washing:** This is an accessible business with low skill and money requirements, suitable for cleaning concrete, furniture, and decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Concrete Work:** Includes driveways, slabs, and patios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

### Niche Product/Service Combinations

*   **Firewood Delivery with On-Site Installation:** A unique approach involves building firewood racks on-site using about $100 worth of materials and selling seasoned firewood for $800-$1,000 per truckload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This can lead to $1,000 profit per day and potentially evolve into a subscription service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. It also creates an entry point for other services like lawn care, snow clearing, or tree work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Local Bar/Restaurant Digital Advertising:** One entrepreneur manages digital ads on TVs in 70 bars and restaurants, charging $10/month per business, netting $20,000/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This model also fosters loyalty from local business owners who enjoy seeing their ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Putting Green Installation:** A higher-skilled niche, but installations can range from $30,000 to $200,000 for high-end turf projects at private residences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Bounce House Rentals:** A favored business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

### Nanny/Night Nurse Recruitment (A "Sweaty Digital Business")

The podcast hosts discuss the idea of a nanny/night nurse recruiting company, which is described as a "sweaty digital business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
*   **Problem:** Difficulty finding qualified night nurses, with existing marketplaces like Care.com being too broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Create a dedicated platform (e.g., nightnurses.com) to provide a directory and recruitment service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition:** Charge a one-time fee ($1,000 is suggested) for vetting candidates, conducting background checks, and setting up interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. This service is valuable for high-income parents who are willing to pay for convenience and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Growth Potential:** Once a customer base is established, other services like payroll for nannies or affiliate marketing for baby products can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
*   **Marketing:** Initially, local marketing like flyers, bandit signs, or even sidewalk chalk near places pregnant women frequent could be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Online advertising on pregnancy tracking apps is also suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

## The Value of Digital Real Estate (Domains)

Huber emphasizes the importance of investing in a strong domain name, comparing it to physical real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   Businesses spend millions on physical properties or lease expensive spaces, but often hesitate to spend more than a few hundred dollars on their digital address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
*   A memorable and relevant `.com` domain can significantly impact lead generation and overall brand recognition, especially with the rise of AI prioritizing these domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.
*   For example, if a lead is worth $300 and a better domain brings 10 extra leads a month, that's $3,000 in additional revenue, easily justifying a higher domain cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

## Sweaty Startups vs. AI/Tech Startups

While the current era sees a boom in AI and tech startups, Huber argues that many will fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.
*   **High Failure Rate:** It's estimated that 93% of AI startups may not reach profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.
*   **Competition:** Competing against well-funded, highly skilled tech entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley is extremely challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
*   **Lower Barrier to Entry:** Sweaty startups often face less sophisticated competitionâ€”businesses that might use fax machines or not answer their phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **AI as a Tool:** AI is likely to become a tool that makes existing business owners more money and reduces labor, rather than primarily creating new, successful AI companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. The best AI startups might even begin as sweaty startups, leveraging their established customer base to build tech solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

You beat the third grade girl, fifth grade girl, you get 30 grand a month. I' I'd play against the third grade girl every time because my odds of having a win and making money um are higher." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>

From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

The concept of validating a [[startup_ideas_and_how_to_evaluate_them | startup idea]] without committing to a full build is explored through the journey of Justin Mayers, co-founder of Kettle and Fire, a business that grew to over $100 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The core premise is to confirm market demand and willingness to pay before significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Kettle and Fire: A Day Zero Validation Story

Justin Mayers details the initial steps taken to validate Kettle and Fire in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Identifying the Problem

While working at Rackspace, Mayers sought to start his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. He had heard about bone broth from friends in CrossFit and read about its benefits for skin, gut, and joint health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. At the time, bone broth was not widely discussed, and finding it online was difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This identified a personal need and a gap in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Validating Market Interest

Mayers focused on two key questions:
1.  How many people actually want this product? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
2.  Are there enough people, and will they spend enough to sustain a meaningful business? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>

To answer these, he employed a two-pronged approach:

*   **Micro-Level Validation (Community Engagement)**: Mayers investigated online communities where his target audience (Paleo and CrossFit communities) congregated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. He looked at sites like Mark's Daily Apple, Paleo Hacks, and [[using_reddit_to_find_startup_ideas | Reddit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. He observed traffic levels and the engagement within threads discussing bone broth's benefits, recipes, sourcing, and cooking methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This showed a "small but fanatic and interested" group of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Macro-Level Validation (Google Trends)**: He used Google Trends to see if "bone broth" was gaining popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The data indicated that interest was "starting to take off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This confirmed that thousands of people were interested and searching for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Mayers emphasizes that while he used Google Trends, the idea stemmed from a personal problem and passion within a community he cared about, not a random search for trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. If Google Trends and subsequent steps had shown no interest, he would not have proceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Validating Willingness to Pay

The next critical step was to determine if people would pay enough to make it a viable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>:

*   **Minimalist Setup**: Mayers purchased the cheapest domain name with "bone broth" in it (BoneBroths.com) for $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. He then paid $5 on Fiverr for a basic logo and renders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Landing Page and Value Proposition**: He created a landing page using Unbounce (a tool from 2015) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The page highlighted value propositions derived from Paleo forums, such as healing leaky gut, convenience (compared to 24-48 hour home cooking), organic ingredients, and 100% grass-fed bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Pricing Strategy**: Despite having no product or production plan, he set a price of $29.99 for 16 ounces, significantly higher than typical grocery store broth ($5 for 16 ounces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This high price point was chosen to ensure profitability if demand existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **"Fake" Checkout Flow**: The "Order Bone Broth Now" button redirected users to Mayers' personal PayPal account to send him $29.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This "super sketchy checkout flow" was intentionally direct to gauge genuine intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Low-Cost Advertising**: He spent about $100 on Bing Ads (cheaper than Google Ads) to drive traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Results**: Over a two-week test, the site achieved a 30% conversion rate for clicking the order button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. He made almost $500 in "revenue" from a $250 ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This validated that people were willing to pay for a non-existent product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Post-Validation Steps

After validating demand, Mayers emailed all customers who had "purchased" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. He informed them that the product was not yet in stock and offered a full refund or a 50% discount if they waited (which ended up being eight months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Most customers chose the discount, demonstrating strong interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This period then focused on figuring out how to actually make and scale the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

## Applying the Framework with Modern Tools (2025)

Mayers reflects on how he would approach the same validation process in 2025, leveraging current [[AI tools for identifying validated startup concepts | AI tools]] and technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### Enhanced Tools for Validation

*   **Improved Design and Landing Pages**: [[AI tools for identifying validated startup concepts | AI tools]] can now create much better landing pages and logos than what was available in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Advanced Sentiment Analysis**: [[AI tools for identifying validated startup concepts | AI]] and other tools can quickly scrape and analyze sentiment across platforms like [[using_reddit_to_find_startup_ideas | Reddit]], forums, and Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

Despite these advancements, the fundamental principle remains: try to sell a product even if it doesn't exist to see if people will pay for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. This can involve direct messaging, emailing, or texting to get initial paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

### Choosing Your Focus: CPG vs. Software

When considering [[startup_ideas_and_brainstorming | startup ideas]], Mayers advises focusing on areas of personal passion and expertise, rather than solely on industry trends like software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. His success in CPG (Kettle and Fire, Shirley Wine) stemmed from a deep interest in health and wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. He suggests:
*   Finding a big problem with relatively few people focused on it, or where energy is moving in that direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   Choosing a problem that genuinely "lights you up" and exploring it until [[startup_ideas_and_brainstorming | interesting ideas]] emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
*   Being on the "frontier" of a topic, where your natural interest leads to new and unique [[startup_ideas_and_brainstorming | ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

### Recommended Tools and Trends

Mayers highlights the importance of mastering new [[AI tools for identifying validated startup concepts | AI tools]] for building and scaling businesses:

*   **Specific Tools**: Bolt.new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, Rok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **Frontier Models**: Claude, GPT, Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

He asserts that becoming a "top 1% user" of these [[AI tools for identifying validated startup concepts | AI tools]] offers high leverage for opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. These tools can dramatically reduce the barriers to entry for CPG and other industries, turning what once cost tens of thousands of dollars into a monthly subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

## AI-Driven Product Redesign Example

The conversation concludes with an example of using [[AIgenerated startup ideas | ChatGPT-4o]] to redesign the Kettle and Fire product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. By prompting [[AIgenerated startup ideas | ChatGPT]] to imagine a "functional beverage" version of Kettle and Fire that looks "fresh, cool, engaging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>, the [[AI tool for identifying validated startup concepts | AI]] generates product concepts with detailed branding and imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.

> "This is great design. You know, my day we paid an agency I think 60 grand to come up with this vibe and look and all these sorts of things. Um maybe if that collapses to $200 a month, you know what I mean? Like all of a sudden it's it's a it's a different kind of thing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>

This demonstrates how [[iterative_design_and_automation_in_startup_development | AI-driven startup ideas]] and [[frameworks_for_developing_and_testing_business_ideas | frameworks for developing and testing business ideas]] can enable a single individual to rapidly design and test multiple [[ai_startup_ideas | AI Startup Ideas]], potentially launching a startup in a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. The "new types of products that can now be built by like one guy in a basement" underscore the transformative potential of [[AI tools for identifying validated startup concepts | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

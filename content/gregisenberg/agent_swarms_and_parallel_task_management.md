[[AI agents in business automation|AI agents]] are capable of replacing some team functions and can be set up to act as [[creating_ai_employees_and_agents|AI employees]] for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Flo, the CEO of Lindy.AI, describes how to use agent swarms to automate business processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. With this approach, users can potentially automate half of their business in half a day, and create their first agent in 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## What are Agent Swarms?
An agent swarm refers to the ability to send a list of tasks to an [[AI agents in business automation|AI agent]], which then reliably, quickly, and in parallel executes all these tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. While individual [[AI agents in business automation|AI agents]] are powerful, they can become unreliable and "lose coherence" over long-term or extensive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. For instance, sending personalized outreach to 500 people using a single agent would be time-consuming, expensive, and prone to failure by the 200th lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

Instead, an agent swarm duplicates the agent for each item on the list, effectively creating multiple agents that tackle the tasks simultaneously, much like "Agent Smith" duplicating himself in *The Matrix* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Applications of Agent Swarms
Agent swarms can be applied to a wide range of business functions, significantly [[enhancing_productivity_with_ai_agents|enhancing productivity]] and allowing small teams to operate like much larger ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

### Meeting Preparation and Management
A "swarm of swarms" can be deployed for meeting preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. For example:
1.  Each morning, an agent checks the day's meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
2.  It then deploys an agent swarm for each meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
3.  Inside each meeting's swarm, another swarm is deployed for every attendee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
4.  This agent leverages existing meeting notes, searches emails, and looks up LinkedIn profiles for each person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
5.  Finally, it sends a daily digest by email, providing relevant context for each meeting and attendee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

This system can even remember specific details, like recommending audio equipment for podcast guests based on past interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### Recruiting and Sales Prospecting
Agent swarms are highly effective for tasks like personalized lead outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, recruiting, and sales prospecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.
Users can provide criteria for candidates or leads, and the agent can:
*   Search for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
*   Present a list of found individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   Once selections are made, enter a swarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   Research each person using tools like Perplexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
*   Send personalized emails, with options for human confirmation before sending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
*   Follow up with reminders if no reply is received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

This process allows for highly cost-effective and efficient recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. Leads can also be uploaded via CSVs or Google Sheets for mass outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, with the system capable of highly personalized messaging based on public data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

### Competitive Analysis
An agent swarm can be configured to perform competitive analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>:
*   It wakes up monthly to get a list of competitors from a spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
*   It deploys a swarm for each competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   For each competitor, it looks up desired information, such as employee count, traffic estimates, recent news, funding rounds, or hiring activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
*   It sends a report highlighting competitors that are "pulling ahead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   All data is logged into a spreadsheet, showing trends over time for various metrics like employee count, website visits, and valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.

### Internal Team Standups and Reporting
Referred to as the "Elon Lindy," an agent swarm can replace middle management layers by facilitating virtual standups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   Users can provide a list of their team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
*   Every week, the agent makes a phone call to each teammate, asking what they accomplished that week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.
*   It then sends a report summarizing what the entire team has conveyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. This has been deployed by customers with over a thousand employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.

### Influencer Outreach
[[Using AI to automate agency operations|AI agents]] can be used for influencer marketing, by finding influencers on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, retrieving their contact information, and offering partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. There are even instances where different [[AI agents in business automation|AI agents]] from different companies have interacted with each other for purposes like restaurant reservations or influencer outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

### User Research and Focus Groups
[[AI applications for automating tasks|LLMs]] are adept at emulating human responses, making them suitable for simulating user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. A Lindy can be prompted to simulate different user personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.
This allows for:
*   Rapid feedback on product ideas or app MVPs from "virtual users" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.
*   Cost-effective user research, costing cents instead of thousands of dollars, and providing 80% of the quality of an actual focus group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

## Implementing Agent Swarms
Lindy.AI offers a no-code platform for [[building_and_scaling_ai_mobile_apps|building and scaling AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. It functions similarly to Zapier for [[aipowered_workflow_and_task_management|AI-powered workflow and task management]], but with agents that can "chat" and learn from interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Lindy.AI has thousands of integrations, including web scrapers for YouTube comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> and widespread integrations for customer support across platforms like Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp, Zendesk, and Intercom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.

### Human in the Loop
It is recommended to insert a "human in the loop" when an [[AI agents in business automation|AI agent]]'s actions could lead to embarrassment, especially during initial cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. This is akin to training an intern; users can oversee and correct the agent's actions, and the agent can learn from this feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

### Choosing AI Models
For most tasks, default models like Claude (3.5) are sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. If an agent proves "too dumb," users can graduate to more powerful (and often more expensive) models like Gemini or O1 (for research tasks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. For cost-effectiveness, Gemini Flash can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

## The Arbitrage Moment
There is a significant "arbitrage moment" in the current technological landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. While [[AI agents in business automation|AI agents]] and [[utilizing_ai_for_scaling_and_automation|AI swarms]] are widely discussed, there is a large gap between what is possible and what businesses are actually implementing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Companies that leverage this gap are experiencing rapid growth, such as Arcades, an AI ad generator that reportedly reached \$5 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) with only seven or eight people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. This highlights the transformative potential for businesses to start [[enhancing_productivity_with_ai_agents|automating tasks]] and [[comparison_between_ai_agents_and_traditional_automation_tools|scaling operations]] using [[AI applications for automating tasks|AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.

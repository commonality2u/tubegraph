David Park, founder of AI startup Jenny AI, successfully scaled his company from zero to $10 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) using a comprehensive growth playbook that includes [[influencer_marketing_strategies | influencer marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This playbook emphasizes the power of short-form content and strategic influencer collaborations for rapid [[user_acquisition_and_growth_strategies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Key Principles of Influencer Marketing

### The Rise of the "Fresh Account"

In contemporary social media, traditional markers of influence like millions of followers or verified checkmarks are less critical than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. A single video from a newly created account can go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Testing has shown that identical content posted on an established account (e.g., 70,000 followers) and a new account (e.g., 50 followers) can result in comparable or even superior engagement for the newer, smaller account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

It is often more advantageous to sponsor a "fresh account" created recently, even if it has similar viewership to a YouTuber with millions of subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This is because:
*   Fresh accounts are frequently "juiced by the algorithm" and are on an upward trend in reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   They are significantly more cost-effective to sponsor, potentially costing 1/100th of what an established YouTuber might charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Established creators often demand high fees (e.g., $20,000 for a 30-second video) that may not yield a positive Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   Collaborating with newer creators is a win-win: they get paid for content they enjoy producing, and businesses gain visibility at a lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Creating Your Own Influencer Accounts

Instead of solely seeking external influencers, businesses can create their own "fresh accounts" and hire a creator to be the public face of their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This approach:
*   Prevents the creator's main account from being "polluted" with too many ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   Allows for consistent content creation (e.g., 30 videos on a new account) without the creator feeling like they are "selling out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Case Study: Ming Duck and Jenny AI

Jenny AI partnered with Ming Duck, paying him $4,000 per month for 20 videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. His content, focusing on writing and communication, aligned well with Jenny AI's early focus as a broader writing tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

*   The account started from scratch with zero followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   It grew to 70,000 followers and generated approximately half a billion views combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   In the first month alone, they garnered 7 million impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   One video alone generating millions of views can lead to thousands in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   This collaboration was a short-term commitment (around three months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

Ming Duck, despite having 300,000 TikTok followers at the time of the deal, was willing to partner for $4,000/month because some creators may not be focused on monetization or haven't found the right product fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Creators can often create content efficiently (e.g., 5-10 minutes a day for a new hook, using supplied visuals), making such deals attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

### Content Strategy for Virality

#### Frequency of Posting
Consistent posting is crucial for exploration before exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. Posting one or more videos daily allows for numerous tests (e.g., different angles, hooks, formats, humor, educational content) to identify what resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. This iterative approach helps uncover "mega bangers" (videos with 1-10 million views) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

#### Finding a Viral Series
The ultimate goal is to identify a "viral series" â€“ a content format that resonates repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. Humans are creatures of habit, often wanting to see variations of what they already enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Once a viral video is found, the next step is to maximize its upside by replicating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

An example is the "how many sticks of spaghetti can hold X weight" video, which led to series with coat hangers, paper, and even broken iPads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. Similarly, Jenny AI used a "Point of View (POV): You have a paper or essay due" series that generated over 300 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This series involved relatable scenarios followed by the consistent solution provided by Jenny AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

#### Format-Product Fit
Viral content should have a strong format-product fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Going viral for the sake of virality results in "empty calories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. A video that gets 20 million views but negligible conversions is ineffective compared to one with 50,000 views that brings in hundreds of thousands in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

#### The Order of Virality
1.  **Farm multiple accounts on each platform**: Instead of one account per platform, aim for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
2.  **Experiment with hooks and video ideas**: Test different creators and content angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Observe competitors and what's gaining attention in other industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
3.  **Identify and turn viral videos into series**: Once a video goes viral, continuously tweak and repost it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
4.  **Post series on multiple accounts**: For Jenny AI, this meant up to seven accounts on each platform (24 accounts total), posting 24 videos daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. This significantly increases the "surface area of luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
5.  **Translate and create videos with international creators**: Expand reach by creating content in other languages (e.g., Mandarin), tracking conversions via UTM clicks and coupon codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.
6.  **Sponsor other pages to repost**: As the content cycle matures, pay large meme pages (often run by younger individuals) to repost your viral videos, giving them a "second life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.
7.  **Use mega-viral content for [[paid_advertising_strategies_for_efficient_growth | paid ads]]**: Leverage proven content for paid campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
8.  **Anticipate content burnout**: Eventually, copycats will emerge, and the audience may tire of the series. This signals a return to step one to find new hooks and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

## Finding Influencers

The most effective way to find influencers is to ask existing users which influencers they follow in your niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.
*   Ask for their social media handles or the specific influencers they follow related to your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.
*   This provides unbiased data on who genuinely influences their audience, as opposed to creators followed for entertainment without buying intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.
*   Once you have a list, use platforms' "suggest similar accounts" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

### An Influencer Finding "Hack"
1.  Create a new Instagram or TikTok account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.
2.  Manually follow all the target influencers on your list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. Do not follow anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.
3.  Watch their videos all the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>.
4.  The algorithm will automatically start suggesting other relevant influencers in the same niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>.

This method effectively uses the algorithm to do the discovery work that agencies charge thousands for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>. It also helps businesses understand their users' content consumption habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>. Through this process, you might discover unknown creators with high-quality content and low follower counts, allowing you to secure "crazy deals" before they go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. Sponsoring a creator whose video appears on your "For You Page" (FYP) when you don't follow them indicates the algorithm is already pushing their content to broader audiences, increasing your upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

## Reaching Out to Influencers

### Multi-Channel Outreach
Use all available communication channels:
*   Direct Messages (DMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>
*   Emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>
*   LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>
*   Other platforms (blogs, Tumblr, Venmo for a unique approach) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>.
    *   *Hack*: Some users have sent small amounts (e.g., $50) via Venmo to get a push notification and response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

If it's difficult to find their contact information, it likely means fewer people are reaching out, making your message stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>. Avoid the common mistake of sending a single email and giving up; influencers receive many messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>.

### Crafting the Message
*   **Be detailed and tailored, but concise**: Avoid lengthy paragraphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   **Demonstrate genuine fandom**: Show you appreciate their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
*   **Explain mutual benefits**: Why should *they* partner with *you*? How will their audience love your product? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>
*   **Avoid irrelevant details**: Don't mention funding rounds or employee numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.
*   **Clearly state it's a paid promotion**: This immediately signals seriousness, as influencers are bombarded with offers for free products or subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **Expect low response rates initially**: Develop a tough skin and focus on optimizing your outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. As your product gains recognition, it becomes easier to secure partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. A larger follower count on your *own* company account can also aid outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.

## Negotiating with Influencers

The goal is to align incentives for mutual benefit: both parties want a video that converts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.
*   **Avoid paying everything upfront**: This retains leverage. Split payments, with a percentage tied to conversions (e.g., via personal coupon codes) or views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.
*   **Be straightforward and transparent**: Share your typical budget and the ROI you expect for a video to break even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. Encourage influencers to be transparent about their demographics and past sponsored content performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.
*   **Negotiate by removing features**: Start by asking for the most expensive package (e.g., link in bio, Instagram story, full usage rights, product-focused video). Then, iteratively remove elements you don't need to arrive at a "true price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.
*   **Offer bulk deals**: Once a fair price for a single video is established, propose a package deal (e.g., three videos a month at a discounted rate) for consistent content flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **Ignore outdated pricing models**: Do not base payments on follower counts alone, as this is a common source of "misinformation" leading to poor ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

## Posting Content

*   **Tailor content to the influencer's audience**: A "one-size-fits-all" strategy won't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Sponsored content must not deviate too far from what the influencer's audience expects, or retention will be poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
*   **Trust the influencer's expertise**: If inexperienced, let the influencer "cook" by creating content similar to their usual posts, but specify when and how the product should be featured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.
*   **Integrate into existing series**: If an influencer has a popular series (e.g., "Top 10 AI tools that feel illegal to know"), aim to have your product included in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>.
*   **Scale through autonomy**: To scale [[influencer_collaboration_in_app_marketing | influencer collaboration]] (e.g., a video every few hours), you must trust influencers with a blueprint. Provide guidelines on product messaging, desired portrayal time, and expected metrics (views, engagement). Offer package deals for monthly content so you don't have to micromanage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.
*   **Don't fear direct ads**: Even if a straightforward ad gets fewer views, it often converts better. Subtle ads might be ignored due to the high volume of content vying for attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. Direct problem/solution framing is more effective for conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.

## Final Tips for Success

[[Strategies for growing online audiences | Growing]] with [[influencer_marketing_strategies | influencer marketing]] and User-Generated Content (UGC) requires managing many relationships and leveraging both creative and analytical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>.
*   **Facilitate partnerships well**: Develop real, human relationships with creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>.
*   **Balance art and science**: While content creation has artistic elements, a significant part is scientific (managing campaigns, tracking data, refining models for winning influencers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.
*   **Leverage any common ground**: Use shared backgrounds or connections (e.g., growing up in the same neighborhood) to build rapport and increase response rates from creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>.

## Post-Initial Growth: Scaling to $10M ARR

While the initial playbook is effective for reaching $5 million ARR, scaling to $10 million involves continued application of these [[techniques_for_leveraging_social_media_for_organic_growth | techniques]] with added focus:
*   **Refine existing strategies**: The core principles of influencer marketing, SEO, and paid ads remain relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.
*   **Improve hiring and team building**: Scaling brings managerial and organizational challenges that require stronger teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>.
*   **Explore new channels**: Jenny AI saw significant revenue from affiliate marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   **Consider acquisitions**: Acquiring smaller startups or companies can be a strategic move to leverage existing expertise and customer bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. Jenny AI acquired a startup at $500k ARR and doubled it to $1.2-1.5 million ARR in five months by applying lessons learned from Jenny AI's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Focus on retention and conversion**: With increased traffic, optimizing the funnel becomes critical. Reducing churn (e.g., from 20% to 9.8% for Jenny AI) significantly impacts [[strategies_for_growing_online_audiences | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>. This is especially important for B2C AI apps, which often face high churn rates (e.g., 30-50% monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>.

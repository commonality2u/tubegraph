Using AI to create advertisements can significantly increase return on ad spend (ROAS), making a business more profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The ability to effectively prompt AI tools like ChatGPT 4o is crucial for maximizing their potential in ad creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Rapid Ad Creation

Jacob Posel, an expert in [[ai_tools_for_generating_creative_assets|creating winning ads]], memes, and visual content with ChatGPT 4o, demonstrates how to generate effective ads in approximately two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This speed allows for extensive experimentation, which is key to finding ads that convert well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The concept of "the ad is the targeting" is facilitated by AI, enabling targeted ad creation at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## ChatGPT 4o for Ad Creation

Unlike pure image models such as Midjourney, Flux, or Ideogram, ChatGPT 4o is a multimodal language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This means prompting is less critical, as it has a strong understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### The Role of Inspiration Images

The most important elements for [[ai_tools_for_generating_creative_assets|creating good ads]] in ChatGPT 4o are the inspiration images and product images provided to the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

*   **Process:** Provide an existing ad you want to adjust as an inspiration, and then provide your own product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Example Prompt:** "add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   ChatGPT 4o is highly intelligent and understands intentions well, producing accurate results based on instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   This method allows for super consistent and reliable ad creation by making simple edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   To test conversion, one can generate the same ad with different characters (e.g., men, female, old, young, different colors) to see what resonates with various audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. ChatGPT is excellent at [[content_generation_using_ai|creating photorealistic images]] of diverse audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Understanding AI Model Knowledge

AI models have a strong understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge wallets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. If your product is new, small, or lacks significant online presence, always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. For widely recognized brands, a reference image may not be necessary as the AI "knows" them well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Prompting Strategies

*   **Keywords:** Using keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" is crucial for generating photorealistic images, otherwise, the AI might default to a cartoonish or strangely colored style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Detailed Descriptions:** A detailed prose description of the desired image is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Font Types and Styles:** For well-known fonts, the AI has a decent understanding, allowing users to experiment with font types (e.g., "font type exo2 bold italic") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Similarly, color styles and aspect ratios can be adjusted in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Direct Image Generation:** To ensure the AI generates an image rather than text describing the ad, explicitly state "generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Directness:** Be very clear and direct in what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **New Chat for Adjustments:** If the initial prompt doesn't yield desired results, start a new chat for adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to worse results because the AI uses its own generated image as a reference, which may contain flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Starting fresh ensures consistency with the initial concept while incorporating improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Exploring Sora for Prompts and Ideation

Sora, which uses the same underlying model as ChatGPT, offers an explore page where users can see how others are prompting and gain ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Clicking on any image on its explore page reveals the prompt used to create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Sora is noted for having less strict policy guidelines and being better at photorealism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. It allows users to remix, adjust prompts, change aspect ratios, or upload their own reference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

This resource is valuable for:
*   Getting the "creative faucet going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   Finding aesthetics not yet used in a specific market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   Shortening the time to value by providing effective prompt ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Iterative Prompting and Ad Refinement

When creating ads for less well-known companies or products, or when blending different themes, the initial generation might be higher risk, requiring more iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. However, for well-known products with strict instructions, a "one-shot" generation is often possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

### Live Ad Creation Example: LCA

An example of [[using_ai_tools_for_rapid_prototyping|using AI tools for rapid prototyping]] and refinement was demonstrated by creating an ad for LCA, a design agency for the AI age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

**Initial Prompt:**
The initial prompt focused on the company's identity and desired luxury vibe:
> "Generate a digital ad for LCA (Lay Checkout Agency). LCA is a SWAT team design agency only for the most interesting brands on the planet helping them with building AI first tools. It only works with the best companies. I have provided some screenshots from their website for you to use as inspiration in the ad as well as a reference vintage Rolex ad as inspiration. Use this to capture the luxury Vibe of the company. Generate the image." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>

The process involved:
1.  **Gathering Images:** Screenshots of the LCA logo, typography, client brands (Dropbox, Salesforce), and a vintage Rolex ad were provided as reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
2.  **Initial Generation:** The AI produced an ad featuring a man, text, and surprisingly, a Rolex watch as the main product, adapting the vintage ad's style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.
3.  **Refinement in New Chat:** To replace the Rolex watch with client logos, a new chat was initiated with refined instructions to avoid the AI relying on its previously generated (and potentially flawed) image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

**Refined Prompt:**
> "rather than generating a watch show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>

This iterative process resulted in an ad that featured the LCA logo, the slogan "design for the AI age," and the logos of well-known companies they work with, creating a sophisticated and relevant advertisement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. This demonstrates how AI can produce creative ads in minutes that might otherwise be difficult to conceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.

The "temperature" concept in LLMs, which refers to the amount of randomness in output given the same input, is generally low for image generation. This means similar prompts will often yield similar results, allowing for predictable iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.

### Ad Dimensions

While AI typically defaults to a 9x16 aspect ratio, users can specify other dimensions like 1x1 or 9x16 in the prompt to suit various ad platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

## The Future of AI in Advertising

[[using_ai_tools_for_app_functionality_and_innovation|Integrating AI tools in product development]] and advertising allows for highly personalized and entertaining ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. This technology enables companies to capitalize on real-time news cycles and cultural moments with relevant, clever, and humorous copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. AI can be set up to monitor news feeds and automatically generate mass ads, a process that was previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

For finding ad inspiration, resources like Creative OS, ForPlay, and Icon.me (which aggregates Meta's ad library) are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

It is an incredible time to [[creating_content_with_ai_tools|create memes]], ads, and other creative content to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

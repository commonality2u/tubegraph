This article explores the process of [[building_apps_using_ai_tools | building applications]] with AI, specifically focusing on integrating and using AI image generators and models, primarily utilizing Cursor's Agent feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The workflow emphasizes local development, iterative improvement, and full stack deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Evolution of AI Development Workflow

Initially, the process involved using VZ for front-end development and Replit for running code with a live web view and easy deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Cursor was connected to Replit to sync codebases via SSH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

More recently, Cursor released its "Agent" feature within Composer, which has significantly streamlined the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This improvement means developers can now use GitHub for templates and tell Cursor to run the app locally, eliminating the need for other tools like Replit for basic setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Cursor Agent and Local Development

Cursor's Agent is described as a highly effective AI agent for coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It has vastly improved over time, making it possible to run apps locally with minimal intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

To start a project with Cursor Agent:
1.  Open Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
2.  Select "Open a folder" and create a new, empty folder on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
3.  Open Composer within Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
4.  Use a single prompt, such as "clone the repo and run it locally in one command," providing a GitHub link to a template (e.g., a Next.js template) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

When running commands with Cursor, "YOLO mode" allows automatic execution without repetitive confirmations, though users should exercise caution and trust the source of any cloned repositories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. More technical users might prefer to manually review and run commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Implementing AI Image Generators with APIs

[[applications_of_ai_in_video_and_image_generation | AI image generation]] relies on APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Platforms like Replicate and Foul.ai make it easier to access and use various [[using_ai_for_content_creation | creative AI models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### Understanding APIs and API Keys

APIs are essentially instruction manuals for how different software components communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Each API has specific coding rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

To use an API, an API token (or key) is required because API usage often incurs costs (e.g., 2-3 cents per image generation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. These tokens allow providers to track usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. It is crucial to keep API keys secure and not expose them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

### Prompting Cursor for Image Generation

To integrate an AI image generator using Cursor:
1.  **Instructions**: Clearly state the desired outcome, e.g., "I want to create a simple AI image generator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
2.  **Examples**: Provide code examples for using the desired AI model (e.g., Flux on Replicate). These can be found on platforms like Perplexity AI or the API provider's documentation and playgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
3.  **API Token**: Include your API token with instructions to place it in the correct environment file (e.g., `.env.local`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

When providing examples, it's beneficial to use working code from API playgrounds, as these demonstrate successful usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

### Troubleshooting and Iteration in AI Development

Errors are a normal part of the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. When an error occurs, it's vital to:
*   Paste the exact error message back into Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   Provide additional context, such as full console outputs, web view observations, and any relevant documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Cursor Agent can read links to documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   Restart the local server if necessary, especially after environment variable changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

### Model Selection and Improvement

The quality of generated images depends heavily on the AI model used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. Users can specify different models within Replicate, such as Black Forest Labs Flux Pro or Ideogram, which excels at [[prompting_techniques_in_ai_ad_generation | generating images with text]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

To find the best models for specific tasks, continuous learning and engagement with the AI community (e.g., through platforms like Twitter or specialized content) are beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

### Adding User Interface and Database Features

After establishing core functionality, the application's design and features can be enhanced:

*   **UI/UX Design**: Prompt Cursor to improve the aesthetic design (e.g., "create an absolutely amazing design for this app change absolutely no functionality") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.
*   **Feature Information Display**: Add user interface elements like an info icon bubble that, when clicked, displays details about the model and parameters used for image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.
*   **User Authentication and Data Storage**: Integrate a database for user sign-in and saving generated content. Firebase is a popular choice for its ease of use and free-to-start tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.

    To set up Firebase:
    1.  Create a new project in the Firebase console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.
    2.  Register a web app and obtain its API tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.
    3.  Provide these API tokens to Cursor to embed them in the `.env` file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>.
    4.  Manually enable **Firestore Database** (in test mode initially) and **Storage** (also in test mode, with a spending limit for safety) in the Firebase console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.
    5.  Enable **Google Authentication** for the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.
    6.  Instruct Cursor to implement user sign-in, restrict homepage access to signed-in users, automatically save generated images to storage, and add a "My Images" tab to display user-specific content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.

## Deploying the Application

Once the application is developed locally, it can be deployed to the internet, creating a full-stack application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.

1.  **GitHub Repository**: Create a new public repository on GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. Cursor Agent can also create and commit to repositories directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>.
2.  **Vercel Deployment**: Use Vercel for deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>.
    *   Instruct Cursor Agent to deploy the app to Vercel, providing the GitHub repository link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.
    *   Log in to Vercel via the CLI when prompted by Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.
    *   Configure project settings (personal/business, project name, directory) through the Cursor terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.
    *   **Crucial Step for API Keys**: After the initial deployment (which might fail due to missing keys), navigate to your project in the Vercel dashboard:
        *   Go to **Projects** > *Your Project Name* > **Settings** > **Environment Variables** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>.
        *   Add the necessary API tokens (e.g., `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`) as environment variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>.
        *   Trigger a redeploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.
    *   **Firebase Domain Authorization**: For the deployed app to function correctly with Firebase, authorize the Vercel domain in your Firebase project:
        *   Go to **Authentication** > **Settings** > **Authorized Domains** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>.
        *   Add the Vercel deployment URL (e.g., `your-app-name.vercel.app`) to the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>.

This process enables the creation of functional, full-stack AI applications accessible on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

## Mindset for AI Development

Developing with AI tools like Cursor Agent is an iterative process, not always a one-shot solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. It often involves troubleshooting and learning from failures, which can lead to significant learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>. The initial focus should be on "sketching" ideas and [[building_mvps_with_ai_tools | building tools]] for personal enjoyment and learning, rather than immediately aiming for commercial value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. This approach encourages experimentation and allows for the discovery of unique use cases, such as specialized diagram generators for presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.

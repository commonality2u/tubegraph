From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

The concept of a minimalist [[realtime_social_coding_platforms | social network]] focused on real-time location sharing addresses the modern challenge of friends being geographically dispersed post-COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. This idea aims to facilitate spontaneous meetups and connections among close friends while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

## The Problem with Current Solutions
Existing solutions like Instagram's status updates, which often indicate a user's current city, show a clear desire for this type of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. However, Instagram's status updates are often superficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Apple's Find My Friends also offers location sharing, but it's a "very flat" tool lacking depth and social features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. The fundamental issue is that current widespread [[realtime_social_coding_platforms | social network]]s like Twitter and Facebook have evolved into different products, and Instagram serves a broader, less private purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Inspiration: The Legacy of Path
The proposed network draws heavily from [[innovative_social_network_ideas_inspired_by_path | Path]], a private [[realtime_social_coding_platforms | social network]] that gained popularity 10 to 12 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:50">[02:22:50]</a>. [[innovative_social_network_ideas_inspired_by_path | Path]]'s core premise was a closed network for only close friends and family, limiting connections to around 75 to 150 people, a number inspired by Dunbar's Number theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Users could share photos, videos, status updates, and locations within this intimate circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. [[innovative_social_network_ideas_inspired_by_path | Path]] was seen as an "anti version" of the broader social media landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. The idea is to essentially "clone [[innovative_social_network_ideas_inspired_by_path | Path]]" with a more modern, "shinier" and "glossier" design for 2025 standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

## Proposed Features and User Experience
The app would be incredibly simple, designed to do "one thing really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Automatic Location Updates**: Users could push a button to automatically update their location, though not necessarily exact GPS coordinates, but rather city or general area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Proximity-Based Feed**: The feed would prioritize friends based on their proximity to the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Conversation Starter**: The primary function is to serve as a conversation starter, alerting friends to overlaps in cities, allowing them to arrange plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional [[realtime_social_coding_platforms | social network]]s where users often "lurk around" rather than contributing or sparking direct conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Private and Closed Network**: Similar to [[innovative_social_network_ideas_inspired_by_path | Path]], the emphasis is on a closed, trusted network, where users feel comfortable sharing their location and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Development and Monetization
### Building the App
Building a consumer [[realtime_social_coding_platforms | social network]] is considered "hard mode" due to the difficulty of achieving network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. However, the advent of [[building_a_social_app_with_ai | AI]] tools makes product creation faster and less expensive, potentially bypassing the need for a multi-million dollar investment and large team for initial beta testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### Monetization Strategies
*   **Subscription Model**: A subscription model, such as charging $20-30 per year, is suggested as a viable option, especially once a network effect is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **Sticker Packs**: [[innovative_social_network_ideas_inspired_by_path | Path]] monetized by selling digital sticker packs for a few dollars each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This could be a supplementary revenue stream.
*   **Anonymized Data**: A more "tech-forward" and "wild idea" considers a future where users can pay for premium subscriptions by contributing their anonymized personal data to train large language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This concept would need careful ethical consideration around privacy.

## Naming the App: Dunbar
A suggested name for this social network is "Dunbar," directly referencing Dunbar's Number. This name inherently communicates the app's core concept of a limited, close-knit social circle, creating a built-in narrative that could attract media attention and differentiate it from larger social platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

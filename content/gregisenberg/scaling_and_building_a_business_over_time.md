Justin Mayers, founder of Kettle and Fire, a business that grew to over $100 million in revenue, shares his framework for validating and scaling startup ideas from day zero, including how he would approach it differently in 2025 using modern tools like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The core principle revolves around validating demand and willingness to pay *before* building the actual product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Day Zero Steps: Idea Validation

In 2014, Justin Mayers was working at Rackspace and wanted to start his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. He had heard about bone broth from friends in the CrossFit community and was reading about its health benefits for skin, gut, and joint health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. At the time, bone broth was not widely discussed or available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

His main questions were:
1.  How many people actually want this product? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
2.  Are there enough people, and will they spend enough to support a meaningful business? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

### Community Research and Trend Analysis
To answer these questions, Justin looked at online communities where his target audience (paleo and CrossFit communities) congregated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. He monitored sites like Mark's Daily Apple, Paleo Hacks, and Reddit to gauge traffic and engagement in threads discussing bone broth's health benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. He observed highly engaged discussions around recipes, sourcing bones, and cooking times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

This micro-level validation showed a "small but fanatic and interested" group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. For macro-level validation, he used Google Trends to see if "bone broth" was trending upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The trend indicated increasing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

At 24, Justin's goal was modest: to build a business that could pay him and his brother $10,000 a month each, equating to a $200,000 annual business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This required only a couple thousand customers spending a few hundred dollars a year each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

> "I think that's totally true. And to be clear, like I was fixing my own problem. I wanted bone broth... This was not like a random thing. I'm looking for any, you know, any sign of life on Google Trends. This was like literally a product I wanted that people that I respected in a space that I cared about and was passionate about were talking about. Then I just use Google Trends to validate that this would be a decent business..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>

## Market Validation: Will People Pay?

The next crucial step was to determine if people would pay enough to make the business viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

1.  **Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Landing Page**:
    *   Justin bought the cheapest relevant domain name ($9.99) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    *   He paid $5 on Fiverr for a "god-awful logo" and some renders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
    *   He created a landing page using Unbounce (a tool from 2015) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   The landing page highlighted key value propositions identified from paleo forums: healing leaky gut, convenience (vs. 24-48 hour home cooking), organic ingredients, and grass-fed bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

2.  **Pricing and "Sketchy" Checkout**:
    *   He set a price of $29.99 for 16 ounces, significantly higher than typical grocery store broth ($5 for 16 ounces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This high price point was chosen to ensure profitability if demand existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
    *   The "Order Bone Broth Now" button led directly to Justin's personal PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

3.  **Advertising and Results**:
    *   He spent about $100 on Bing Ads (cheaper than Google Adwords at the time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   During a two-week test, despite the non-existent product and "super sketchy checkout flow," people converted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
    *   The test generated almost $500 in revenue with a 30% conversion rate for clicking the order button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
    *   He estimated that with a proper product, this approach could yield around $100,000 in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This validated that "people will actually pay for this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Product Realization and Customer Management

After validating demand and willingness to pay, the next step was to figure out how to actually make the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

Justin emailed every person who placed an order, being completely transparent that the product didn't exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. He offered a full refund or a 50% discount if they waited a few weeks (which turned into eight months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Most customers opted for the discount, demonstrating strong interest and willingness to wait for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

This process allowed him to validate the idea for Kettle and Fire, ensuring enough people cared and were willing to pay for a product that didn't exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The subsequent eight months were spent figuring out manufacturing and [[scaling_startups_from_zero_to_10_million_revenue | scaling]] the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

## Building in 2025: Leveraging AI

If starting Kettle and Fire today (2025), Justin notes significant advantages with new tools, particularly AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### Enhanced Validation and Design
*   **Improved Landing Pages and Design**: AI can generate much better landing pages and logos compared to 2015's tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. For example, using ChatGPT4o to redesign Kettle and Fire packaging can produce "cool" and "engaging" designs quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. This drastically reduces the cost and time for design work, from potentially $60,000 for an agency to $200 a month with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.
*   **Sentiment Analysis**: AI tools can quickly scrape and analyze sentiment across platforms like Reddit, forums, and Twitter, providing deeper insights into consumer needs and desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Rapid Prototyping**: Tools like Bolt.new (bolt.new) can help build and launch a landing page for a startup in as little as a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

### The Enduring Core Principle
Despite technological advancements, the fundamental principle remains: try to sell a product even if it doesn't exist yet and see if people will pay for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The goal is to get even 10 people to pay for the concept, which provides immense validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Choosing Your Business Arena
Justin advises aspiring founders to focus on areas where they are genuinely passionate and "on the frontier" â€” among the most interested 0.1% of people on a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

> "I often think that like I had really I it ended up that I've had a bunch of good ideas in CPG, but that's because I'm very very interested in the health stuff... I have this macro passion and interest in in just like improving human health and so and trying to solve the chronic disease crisis which I think is the biggest problem in the country." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>

By being deeply engaged in a field (like health and wellness for Justin), founders are more likely to identify novel and interesting ideas because they are naturally spending a lot of time in that space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Finding a problem that "really lights them up" or that they find interesting allows them to circle that problem until they discover solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

### Recommended Tools
Mayers highlights the importance of becoming proficient with AI tools:
*   **Bolt.new** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>
*   **Rok** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>
*   **Frontier Models**: Claude, GPT (like Chat GPT40), Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>

> "I think that getting familiar with these different tools like uh bolt new is one rok is another one um and just sort of and frankly playing with just the frontier models claw gpt gemini um you know it just makes a lot of sense in my view and becoming a like top 1% user there's probably few things that you can do that will be as high leverage as that uh from an opportunity standpoint point." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>

AI significantly lowers the barriers to [[launching_and_scaling_a_subscription_business | building and scaling]] companies, enabling individuals to create products that were previously only feasible for small or medium-sized teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. This creates a "whole universe of products" that can now be built by a "one guy in a basement" using AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways
*   **Validate first**: Don't build until you've validated market interest and willingness to pay, even with a "sketchy" MVP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.
*   **Leverage community**: Deeply understand the pain points and language of your target communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Test willingness to pay**: Set a high price point to gauge true demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Transparency with early adopters**: Be honest if your product isn't ready; their continued interest is a strong signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Embrace AI**: Utilize modern AI tools for rapid design, sentiment analysis, and prototyping to lower costs and accelerate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Follow your passion**: Build in areas where you are genuinely interested and "on the frontier" to generate unique and impactful ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Iterate**: Your first product might not be a breakout success, but consistently circling a problem you care about can lead to breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

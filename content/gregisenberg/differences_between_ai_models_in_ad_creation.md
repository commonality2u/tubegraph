The landscape of [[creating_commercials_using_ai_technologies | AI-powered ad creation]] offers various models and approaches, each with distinct characteristics and optimal uses. Understanding these differences is crucial for [[leveraging_ai_for_marketing_strategies | effective marketing strategies]] and maximizing return on ad spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## ChatGPT 4o vs. Other Image Models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>

ChatGPT 4o is highlighted as a new image model being widely discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Unlike pure image models such as Midjourney, Flux, or Ideogram, ChatGPT 4o is a multimodal language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Prompting Philosophy
*   **ChatGPT 4o**: Prompting is "way less important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Users can be straightforward, as the model has a strong understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Other models (implied)**: Often require more precise and detailed prompting.

### Key Factors for Effective Ads
For ChatGPT 4o, the most critical elements for creating winning ads are the **inspiration images** and **product images** provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Understanding Brand Recognition and Reference Images

A significant distinction among AI models lies in their existing knowledge base:
*   **Well-known Concepts/Brands**: Models like ChatGPT have a robust understanding of well-established concepts, ideas, and brands such as Nike, Adidas, or Ridge Wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For these, prompting can be simpler, requiring less explicit imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **New/Small Products**: If a product is relatively new, small, or lacks significant online presence (e.g., millions in monthly ad spend), it is crucial to **always provide a reference image** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Sora as an Exploration Tool

Sora, which uses the same underlying model as ChatGPT, offers an "explore page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This page allows users to:
*   Understand how others are prompting effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   Gain inspiration and ideation for their own prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   View the exact prompt used for any image displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   Remix, adjust prompts, change aspect ratios, and upload reference images directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

Notably, Sora is observed to be "better at photo realism" and have "less strict policy guidelines" compared to other implementations, despite potentially using similar underlying models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This feature can help users discover new aesthetics and shorten the time to value in ad creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Best Practices for [[how_to_create_ads_using_ai_models_like_chatgpt | Ad Creation with AI]]

### Prompting for Realism and Consistency
*   **Keywords for Realism**: To ensure photorealistic images, explicitly use keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photorealistic" in your prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Otherwise, the output might default to a cartoonish appearance or undesirable colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Font and Style Control**: For well-known fonts, models can generally provide a decent representation based on their training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Users can also adjust color styles and aspect ratios within the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Generating Images Only**: To ensure the AI generates an image rather than descriptive text, include "generate the image" in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### Iterative Process and [[troubleshooting_and_consulting_multiple_ai_models | Troubleshooting]]
*   **Clarity in Prompts**: When struggling with a prompt, it is crucial to be "very clear" and "very direct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Starting New Conversations**: If an initial prompt doesn't yield desired results, it's recommended to **start a new chat** rather than adjusting within the same conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This prevents the model from using a flawed AI-generated image as a reference for subsequent attempts, which can lead to progressively worse results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Starting fresh ensures the images remain consistent while incorporating new prompt adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Expected Iterations**: For complex or vague prompts, expect two to three iterations to achieve the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Simpler, low-risk prompts with strict instructions or well-known products may yield results on the first try <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

## Benefits of [[adapting_to_ai_for_content_creation | AI in Content Creation]]

AI significantly enhances the ability to:
*   **Experiment at Scale**: [[content_generation_using_ai | AI allows marketers]] to experiment with numerous ad variations (e.g., different demographics, expressions) at an unprecedented scale, directly impacting conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Rapid Adaptation to Trends**: Companies can now quickly create ads that capitalize on short news cycle moments, a process that was previously slow and prohibitively expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **Increased Accessibility**: AI tools democratize the process of remixing and replicating existing ad concepts, making it accessible to a wider range of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

For ad inspiration, tools like Creative OS, ForPlay, and Icon.me read Meta's ad library, tag them, and make them searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

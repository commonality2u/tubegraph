Manis AI is a Chinese AI application gaining attention for its ability to convert ideas into automated businesses and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While impressive in its agentic capabilities, allowing it to run tasks and tools more advanced than typical AI, Manis AI is still in its beta stage and presents several challenges and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

## Technical Limitations

### Context Window Issues
A significant limitation observed is the decline in [[manis_ai_overview | Manis AI]]'s performance with "extremely long context" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. This means that for complex tasks requiring extensive information processing, [[manis_ai_overview | Manis AI]] may encounter issues, necessitating a reset of its computer or starting a new session altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>. This "context limitation" is highlighted as potentially the "biggest issue" for the [[manis_ai_overview | Manis AI]] team to address before a wider release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>.

### Deployment and Code Generation Flaws
While [[manis_ai_capabilities_in_creating_startups | Manis AI]] can generate project structures and code for applications, its deployment process is "not as straightforward" as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>. For example, during an attempt to clone DocuSign's e-signature functionality, [[manis_ai_overview | Manis AI]] was unable to successfully deploy the application to a public network and suggested a local deployment instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. It even encountered terminal errors while trying to zip the project files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>. This suggests that the deployment aspect is not yet fully solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

### Interface Interaction and Refinement
[[manis_ai_overview | Manis AI]] has also encountered issues with navigating complex web interfaces, such as being "stuck" on captchas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. When creating games or user interfaces, the initial output may lack aesthetic refinement and require further specific instructions to add details and make it "more pretty" or "more interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>.

## Performance and Scalability

### Frequent Errors in Beta
As [[manis_ai_overview | Manis AI]] has seen increased user access, more frequent errors have been observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>. The website has been "hammered" by traffic, leading to issues even for simpler tasks like researching startup ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>. This points to ongoing [[challenges_in_ai_and_content_automation | scale issues]] that the developers need to address before a public launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>.

### Usage Limits
Currently, [[manis_ai_overview | Manis AI]] operates with a "maximum daily usage limit," reportedly 10 requests or sessions per day for beta users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>. While a workaround involving starting new sessions may exist, this limit restricts extensive use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>.

## Data Privacy Concerns

As a Chinese company, there's a "valid concern" that [[manis_ai_overview | Manis AI]] may be obligated to provide data access to the Chinese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. Users are advised to be "very careful and mindful" of the type of data they share and to avoid providing personal information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. It's recommended to test the tool with simple tasks, like cloning a public website, rather than giving sensitive data or integrating financial services like Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Users are also encouraged to scan any generated code before deploying it locally and to run it in a virtual sandbox in the cloud rather than directly on their personal computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>.

Despite these [[limitations_and_potential_of_replit_agent_and_ai_tools | limitations and challenges]], [[manis_ai_overview | Manis AI]] is seen as a significant step towards AGI, especially for non-technical users looking to automate business building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>.

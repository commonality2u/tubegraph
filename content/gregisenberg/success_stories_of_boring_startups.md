Many wealthy individuals achieve their fortunes through "boring" or "sweaty" businesses that are often overlooked in favor of high-tech ventures [00:00:24]. According to Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," these opportunities can lead to significant wealth [00:00:05].

## Why "Boring" Businesses?
While much attention is given to software, SaaS, and [[ai_startup_success | AI startups]], the reality is that many genuinely wealthy people in local towns made their money through mundane but essential services [00:01:13]. These include:
*   Underground utilities [00:00:26]
*   Surveying companies [00:00:27]
*   HVAC businesses [00:00:28]
*   Real estate development [00:00:30]

To significantly increase the odds of becoming wealthy, it's advised to pursue something "normal" or "boring" [00:02:05].

## Nick Huber's Journey into Sweaty Startups

Nick Huber exemplifies this approach, having made millions from seemingly unglamorous ventures [00:01:12].

### Storage Squad
Huber started a pickup and delivery storage business called Storage Squad, catering to students who needed to store belongings over the summer [00:02:17].
*   **Revenue**: At its peak, Storage Squad generated approximately $2.2 million in annual revenue [00:02:34].
*   **Profit**: The business made $400,000 to $500,000 per year [00:02:40].
*   **Marketing**: The primary and almost exclusive marketing method until 2017 was sidewalk chalk, placed in high-traffic student areas like Boston and Ithaca [00:02:48]. Huber personally wrote these ads over 5,000 times [00:03:28].
*   **Bootstrapping**: The business was bootstrapped using old, rusty vans bought on Craigslist and from repair shops for low prices ($1,500 - $2,200) [00:03:44].
*   **Warehouse**: Storage Squad operated out of a 35,000 sq ft warehouse that could hold items for over 2,000 students (5,000+ boxes) [00:04:13].
*   **Sale**: The business was sold in 2020 for $1.75 million, with no debt [00:04:22].
*   **Origin**: The idea originated when someone inquired about storing items in Huber's apartment instead of leasing it, leading him to make $150 by storing their belongings [00:04:45]. The business was profitable from day one [00:05:06].

### Self-Storage Facilities
Leveraging the success of Storage Squad, Huber and his partner invested in self-storage facilities [00:02:42].
*   **First Acquisition**: In 2019, they bought a 40,000+ sq ft facility with 180+ units in Erie, Pennsylvania, at a public auction for $625,000 [00:05:30]. This neglected property was only making $4,000 a month in revenue and had over a hundred abandoned units [00:05:44].
*   **Second Acquisition**: Another facility in North Georgia was purchased for $1.5 million when it was generating $15,600-$16,000 in monthly revenue [00:06:09].
*   **Growth**: This North Georgia facility now generates $40,000 per month in revenue and is valued at $4.5 million, representing over $2 million in increased value without complex inventions or external funding [00:06:20].

## Other Successful "Sweaty" Startup Examples

Huber highlights several other [[bluecollar_startup_strategies | sweaty startups]] that generate significant income:

*   **Lawn Care Company**: Huber's brother runs a lawn care company using bandit signs as his only marketing [00:07:32]. He gains 30-40 new customers annually in April/May, grows his company by 30% per year, and made over $100,000 last year while spending two months fishing [00:07:39].
*   **Mobile Detailing Business**: A one-year college graduate operating "Detailed Dogs" generated $17,000 in revenue and $10,000 in profit in a single month (October 2024), making $120,000 annually [00:07:57].
*   **High-End Transportation**: A friend and his three drivers in Atlanta provide high-end airport transportation, doing "really well" [00:08:18].
*   **Firewood Delivery with Onsite Racks**: A service that builds firewood racks on-site (for about $100 in materials and 1.5 hours of work) and then delivers seasoned firewood for $800-$1,000 [00:08:44]. This allows for a profit of $1,000 per day or over $100 per hour, especially as a recurring subscription service [00:08:57]. It can also be an entry point for other services like lawn mowing or tree work [00:09:41].
*   **Local Bar TV Advertising**: An individual in North Georgia charges businesses $10 per month to display 7-second rotating ads on TVs in 70 bars and restaurants, netting $20,000 a month [00:10:21]. This model builds loyalty among local business owners, who enjoy seeing their ads pop up [00:11:09].
*   **Putting Green Installation**: A higher-skilled service involving turf installation for residences, capable of generating $30,000 to $200,000 per project [00:11:40].
*   **Tree Removal**: Despite risks and the need for expensive equipment and skilled employees, this business is highly lucrative; two workers earned over $3,000 for four hours of work from one client [00:11:54].
*   **Christmas Light Installation**: While risky due to heights, it can be very profitable, with some clients paying $3,500-$4,000 for installation for a few months [00:12:17].
*   **Power Washing**: A low-skill, low-capital entry point for cleaning concrete, furniture, and decks [00:12:54].
*   **Concrete Work**: Services like driveways, slabs, and patios [00:13:04].
*   **Bounce House Rentals** [00:13:08].

## The Digital "Sweaty" Startup: Night Nurses.com

A new [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_ideas | startup idea]] discussed is a service for finding night nurses, inspired by the personal experience of the host [00:14:11].

*   **Problem**: Difficulty finding a dedicated, reliable marketplace for night nurses, as existing platforms like Care.com are too broad [00:14:22].
*   **Solution**: Create a specialized directory/service for night nurses, possibly leveraging the domain "NightNurses.com," which was available for $13,000 (or $1,100/month for 13 months) [00:15:57].
*   **Business Model**:
    *   Start as a service that vets and sources night nurses for a one-time fee (e.g., $1,000) [00:27:29].
    *   Leverage [[ai_startup_ideas_and_incubation | AI]] to build the directory and generate organic traffic through blogs and content (e.g., mom advice, product reviews) [00:16:51].
    *   Expand into related services like nanny recruiting or even a payroll provider, transitioning into a "fintech [[ai_startup_success | AI company]]" on the foundation of a [[bluecollar_startup_strategies | sweaty startup]] [00:26:47].
*   **Customer Value**: High-value customers (new parents) who are willing to pay for convenience at the beginning of their journey, opening doors for cross-selling other baby-related services [00:15:03].
*   **Marketing**: Utilize physical [[bluecollar_startup_strategies | sweaty startup]] tactics like handing out flyers, bandit signs, or sidewalk chalk in areas where pregnant mothers gather [00:18:20].

## The Value of Premium Domains

Investing in a premium .com domain is viewed as crucial digital real estate for any business [00:20:07].
*   Huber compares it to spending millions on physical real estate or hundreds of thousands on facade renovations for a storage facility [00:19:26].
*   He argues that spending a few hundred dollars on a domain is a foreign concept to many, but it's an "unbelievable investment" [00:19:56].
*   The host believes that large language models (LLMs) will prioritize .com domains over .io or .co, leading to more organic leads [00:20:13].
*   Even a small increase in leads (e.g., 10 extra leads a month, worth $300 each) can quickly justify the cost of a domain lease or purchase [00:20:26].
*   Huber spent $450,000 on "Somewhere.com" and recouped the value within a year [00:18:54].

## Boring vs. [[ai_startup_success | AI Startups]]

When comparing [[ai_startup_success | AI startups]] to traditional "boring" businesses, Huber highlights the competitive landscape [00:23:08].
*   **High Failure Rate**: An estimated 93% of [[ai_startup_success | AI startups]] might not reach profitability [00:23:59]. Huber suggests it could be as high as 99% [00:24:06].
*   **Competition**: [[ai_startup_success | AI startups]] often compete against highly funded, brilliant individuals from top universities [00:24:27].
*   **Lower Barrier**: In contrast, "boring" businesses often compete against established players who may use outdated methods (e.g., fax machines) and provide poor customer service [00:24:40].
*   **Increased Odds of Success**: Choosing to compete in a less competitive field, even for smaller gains, significantly increases the odds of success [00:25:01].
*   **[[ai_startup_success | AI]] as a Tool**: [[ai_startup_success | AI]] is more likely to make existing business owners more money by improving efficiency and reducing labor, rather than being the sole product of a successful [[ai_startup_success | AI company]] [00:28:57]. Just as lawnmowers made lawn care companies more profitable, [[ai_startup_success | AI]] can serve as a tool for "boring" businesses [00:28:34].

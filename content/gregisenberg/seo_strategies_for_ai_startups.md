David Park, founder of Jenny AI, shares insights into [[growth_tactics_for_ai_startups | growth tactics for AI startups]], including a detailed look at [[seo_strategies_for_brand_growth | SEO strategies]]. Jenny AI successfully scaled from zero to $10 million ARR, partly utilizing an in-house SEO agency.

## When to Start with SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>

For early-stage entrepreneurs, SEO is often considered a "trap" due to its delayed gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. It can take a long time to generate traffic through SEO efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>. Park suggests that faster traffic can be gained through other [[marketing_and_user_acquisition_for_ai_startups | marketing and user acquisition for AI startups]] methods, such as influencer marketing or User-Generated Content (UGC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.

It is advisable to begin investing heavily in SEO once a startup has a steady income stream and has achieved some semblance of product-market fit (PMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>. This allows for reinvesting earned money into SEO efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>.

## Key SEO Strategies and Hacks

### Acquiring an SEO Agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>
Jenny AI notably acquired an entire SEO agency to make them their exclusive client, ensuring dedicated focus on their SEO needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>. This unorthodox approach allowed Jenny AI to become their main client and benefit from their expertise in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>.

### Targeting Featured Snippets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>
A practical SEO hack is to identify pages that already have featured snippets for specific queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. By crafting the perfect answer to that query, a company can "leapfrog" over competitors to secure the featured snippet, driving significant traffic to their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>.

### Boosting Brand Name Searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>
While SEO can be a direct effort, it also benefits indirectly from other marketing channels. When users see content on platforms like TikTok from influencer marketing or UGC, they often don't click the in-app link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. Instead, they search for the product's name directly on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. This increase in brand name searches legitimizes the brand in the eyes of Google, passively boosting SEO without direct effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.

### Focusing on Valuable Keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>
It's crucial to analyze the value of traffic obtained from SEO. Prioritize "juicy keywords" that indicate a buying intent over "vanity metrics" or keywords related to "free" versions of a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. For example, ranking for queries about the "best tool" is more valuable than ranking for "free tool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>. This ensures that SEO efforts lead to conversions and return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>.

## Advanced SEO Tactics for Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>

As a startup matures and scales, additional SEO tactics can be employed:
-   **Creating Mini-Tools:** Developing free, helpful tools that attract users and link back to the main product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.
-   **Multi-Language Landing Pages:** Expanding reach by creating landing pages in various languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>.
-   **Extensive Content Writing:** Regularly publishing high-quality content relevant to the target audience and keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.

Jenny AI spends tens of thousands of dollars per month on increasing its SEO, which has proven to be fruitful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>.

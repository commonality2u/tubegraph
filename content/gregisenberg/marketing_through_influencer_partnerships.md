[[leveraging_creators_and_influencer_partnerships_for_business_growth | Influencer partnerships]] and [[influencer_marketing_and_its_impact | influencer marketing]] are identified as a primary lever to drive downloads for consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. This strategy was successfully used to grow the Cal AI app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

## Designing for Influencer Marketing
When designing an app, it's crucial to consider how an influencer will showcase the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. This involves "reverse engineering" the app's design around its marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

Key considerations for app design in the context of [[influencer_marketing_and_its_impact | influencer marketing]]:
*   **Visual Appeal** Ensure the app looks appealing enough to "wow" someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Simplicity** The app should be simple and clear enough for a viewer to understand its value proposition immediately, even if the phone is only on screen for two seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. If an app is too convoluted, [[influencer_marketing_and_its_impact | influencer marketing]] will not be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
*   **Branding** Place the app's name prominently on the homepage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. The name should also be clearly visible on screens that are most likely to be featured in influencer videos, especially the "wow" factor screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.
*   **"Wow" Factor Feature** Identify the specific feature that will most impress the audience and make them want to download the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. For an app like Dr. AI, the "scan skin" feature with a danger level diagnosis is considered the main wow factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.

## Identifying and Approaching Influencers
When selecting influencers, it is crucial to focus on the **audience of the influencer**, rather than just their niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. An influencer's niche might be different from their actual audience demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.

### Audience Research
To understand an influencer's audience, manually read through the comments section of their posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. For example, a "doctor" influencer might have an audience primarily composed of aspiring doctors or medical professionals, rather than the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. Similarly, "Mom hacks" influencers might not always have an audience of actual mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

### Target Audience Example: Dr. AI
For an app like Dr. AI, the primary target audience is likely concerned mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. To reach them, find influencers who are themselves mothers and whose audience also consists of mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.

### Content Angles
Influencers should create content that seamlessly integrates the app's value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.
*   **Personal Stories**: A "get ready with me" influencer might share a personal anecdote about finding a suspicious mark on their arm, using the app for diagnosis, and realizing it was harmless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
*   **Realistic Scenarios**: For a mom influencer, a realistic scenario could involve a child coming home with a bump, the mom using the app to scan it, and the app confirming it's just mud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:39:03]</a>.

### Reaching Out
Influencers can be contacted through both email and direct messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.

## Pricing Structures for Influencer Deals
Influencers prefer to be paid upfront rather than on a pay-per-view basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. To ensure profitability, aim for the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) to be greater than the Cost Per Mille (CPM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.

*   **Predicting Views**: Accurately predict how many views an influencer's content will likely generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. For example, if a creator averages 250,000 views per video, four posts a month would equate to 1 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:13]</a>.
*   **Calculating Profitability**: Assume an initial RPM (e.g., $5 for a new app) and then measure actual revenue generated over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:24]</a>. If paying an influencer $5,000 for 1 million views, this results in a $5 CPM. Ideally, a CPM under $5,000 should be profitable with a $5 RPM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:47]</a>.

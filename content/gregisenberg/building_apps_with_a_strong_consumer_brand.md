Hunter Isacson, a creator of consumer apps with over 300 million downloads, shares his playbook for building successful consumer applications, focusing on the importance of [[branding_and_marketing_strategies_for_products | branding]] and organic growth [00:00:03]. His apps include NGL, which garnered 250 million downloads, and other apps reaching 60-70 million downloads, including a dating app and a crypto app [00:00:19].

## The Opportunity in Consumer Apps
There is currently a significant opportunity in the [[consumer_mobile_app_startup_opportunities | consumer mobile app]] space, especially with [[building_ai_apps_for_organic_growth | consumer AI]], allowing for the creation of startups that can generate substantial revenue without needing venture capital [00:00:41].

## Hunter Isacson's Playbook for $1M MRR
Hunter Isacson's strategy for building a $1 million per month app business focuses on several key steps:

### 1. Build a Simple Experience
Start by identifying the bare-bones Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features that are sufficient to solve a core problem, even if not fully optimized [00:18:18]. The goal is to get a functional product out quickly [00:18:43].

### 2. Test Content Early
Before the app is even live, test content on platforms like TikTok or Instagram Reels to see how people respond to the app's premise or formats [00:18:56].

### 3. Select a Core Action and Northstar Metric
Identify a single "Northstar Metric" – a core action that a high percentage of users should complete [00:19:20]. This metric guides all decisions and helps resolve tradeoffs during development [00:19:30], [00:19:46].

*   **Examples of Northstar Metrics:**
    *   **Wink (make new friends app):** Percentage of users getting a match on their first day [00:19:55].
    *   **NGL (anonymous messaging):** Percentage of users sharing the link and sharing a few replies [00:20:26]. This was crucial for training users on a new Instagram feature [00:21:20].
    *   **Bags (crypto app):** How many people fund their accounts and make one trade on the first day [00:21:03].

A high percentage for this core action means over 90% completion, aiming for a single, linear user flow to make success or failure apparent [00:26:00], [00:26:14].

### 4. Continue Seeding and Leverage Growth Loops
Once the core action is validated (e.g., with 90% completion), apply learnings and increase pressure by seeding the app in different audiences, niches, and countries, often working with creators [00:26:44], [00:27:01].

*   **Integrate Sharing/Inviting:** Part of the core action should ideally include some form of sharing or inviting [00:27:23]. This creates a viral loop, increasing the K-factor and reducing reliance on external marketing [00:27:51].
    *   **NGL:** Users posted the NGL link on Instagram or Snapchat, which was a four-step process they had to teach users [00:20:33], [00:28:34].
    *   **Bags:** Users would log in with Twitter, claim their Bags link, and share it, contributing to a leaderboard and building hype [00:29:39].

### 5. Build a Brand People Love (and Understand)
A strong consumer brand is critical. This includes:

*   **Simple, Resonating Names:** Hunter's apps (Wink, NGL, Bags) use simple names that resonate with users [00:21:38], [00:21:49].
*   **Using Slang/Community Language:** Coining the app name from community slang, like "Bags" for a crypto app or "NGL" (not going to lie) for an anonymous messaging app, helps set a young, comfortable, and colloquial tone [00:22:17], [00:22:25], [00:23:40].
*   **On-the-Nose Clarity:** The app's name and branding should be obvious about what it is, avoiding complexity to prevent confusion [00:22:44], [00:22:54], [00:23:07].
*   **Authentic Voice:** Maintaining an authentic voice in public communications (e.g., social media) makes people love and share the product more, increasing affinity and trust [00:31:41], [00:32:50], [00:32:54].

### Design Approach
Hunter designs all his apps himself, including the branding, using tools like Figma [00:24:57], [00:25:02], [00:25:11].

## Case Studies and Inspirations

### CalaAI
An example of [[building_ai_apps_for_organic_growth | using AI tools]] to package a simple concept (calorie tracking) with an amazing funnel, good onboarding, and user investment to create a highly successful app [00:02:55], [00:03:03], [00:03:05], [00:03:08], [00:03:14], [00:03:22], [00:03:25].

### Hallow
The #1 app for Christian and Catholic prayers, Hallow successfully digitized and modernized the Bible experience, appealing to millennials and Gen Z by adding features like push notifications and making it more colorful [00:04:40], [00:05:10], [00:05:12], [00:05:16], [00:05:18], [00:05:23]. It offers daily use cases (prayers, meditations) and community challenges [00:07:38], [00:07:50], [00:08:05], [00:08:07]. The app offers family plans to encourage sharing within groups [00:05:35]. This shows an opportunity to create similar spiritual apps across different religions [00:06:16].

### Locket
Locket was the first mainstream app to leverage iPhone widget functionality socially, allowing users to send pictures directly to friends' home screens [00:10:35], [00:10:40], [00:12:26]. Its growth was propelled by the relationship/best friend side of TikTok [00:10:52], [00:10:57], [00:10:59]. This highlights the importance of identifying and capitalizing on new platform features or "wild west" opportunities (e.g., Apple's Live Activities and lock screen widgets) [00:11:52], [00:12:13].

### NGL
NGL succeeded by taking an existing idea (anonymous messaging, seen in apps like Ask.fm, Yikyak) and adapting it to a new channel – Instagram's widely available link feature [00:15:15], [00:15:27], [00:15:31], [00:16:00]. This demonstrates that reinventing the wheel is not always necessary; rather, it's about finding existing ideas that fit new channels or platforms [00:17:03], [00:17:06]. NGL spent less than $10,000 on [[marketing_strategies_for_new_apps | marketing]] to achieve 250 million downloads by seeding the app through creators and [[tiktok_marketing_strategies_for_consumer_apps | TikTok and Instagram]] [00:14:24], [00:14:38].

### Pangu
Pangu is an example of injecting AI into an existing concept (virtual pets, similar to Tamagotchi) to create a novel experience with animated characters and human-like AI interactions [00:34:09], [00:34:47], [00:35:01], [00:35:26].

## Future Trends and Startup Opportunities
Hunter Isacson is interested in crypto going mainstream and augmented reality glasses as the next hardware platform for immersive, sharable AI experiences [00:36:54], [00:37:15], [00:38:06]. He emphasizes that for young people interested in tech, [[consumer_mobile_app_startup_opportunities | building consumer mobile apps]] is ideal for understanding human psychology, creating beloved products, and achieving global viral reach [00:40:26], [00:40:36]. The increasing quality of [[building_apps_with_ai_tools | AI tools]] means that soon, technical expertise may not be a prerequisite for building consumer apps [00:41:39].

The key takeaway for [[building_startup_ideas_around_niche_trends | developing startup ideas]] is to focus on frameworks (e.g., "NGL for X," "CalaAI for X," "Locket for X," "Pangu for X") rather than solely on original ideas, applying proven formats to new niches or contexts [00:35:36], [00:36:24], [00:36:28].

Brett, a one-man designer from Designjoy, is noted for generating millions of dollars annually through his design work, with the most compelling aspect being his [[using_ai_and_technology_in_marketing | use of AI]] to create stunning designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He emphasizes that the path to generating beautiful graphics with AI is surprisingly simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Ease of Entry into AI Design

Contrary to common perception, individuals without prior design knowledge can create significant value using AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The content and tutorials are not solely for designers but for anyone with subscriptions to tools like Midjourney or ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Having "good taste" helps, but there's no "skill issue" for non-creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Core AI Design Tools and Their Applications

The current generative AI landscape includes various tools for image and video generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. While many tools exist, sticking to the top three or four is recommended to avoid distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Higgsfield: Template-based Creation
Higgsfield is a user-friendly tool ideal for beginners wanting to explore AI creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. It offers pre-set templates and actions, simplifying the process of communicating with the AI, especially for those unfamiliar with directorial terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Users can select a preset, upload a product image, and generate an ad that intelligently incorporates the product's branding and text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This tool is excellent for creating quick Instagram ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Midjourney: Artistic Styling
Midjourney excels at artistic styling for image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It's the go-to tool for creating artistic visuals, like vintage aerial photos or brand directions for specific themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. It allows for [[using_ai_tools_for_content_creation | image prompts]] (inserting a photo to influence content) and style references (applying colors, shadows, highlights, and depth of field from a reference image) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Mixing different styles can lead to surprising generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### ChatGPT: Prompt Generation & Specificity
ChatGPT is crucial for generating effective prompts, especially for achieving specific outcomes that Midjourney might not perfectly capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Previously, prompting required author-level descriptive skills, but ChatGPT simplifies this, making it accessible to anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. It can expand on minimal input, dreaming up collections of scenes and rich details for consistent imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This partnership is key for creating high-quality AI art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### Runway: Image-to-Video Motion
Runway is a top-tier image-to-video tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. It allows users to upload an image and add motion based on a prompt generated by ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. For example, ChatGPT can generate prompts for soft ripples in water, smoke, or trees blowing in the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Videos are typically 5 to 10 seconds long, and by saving the last frame of a video as an image, it's possible to create continuous shots by chaining multiple videos together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

### Cling: Looping Video & AI Sound
Cling is another image-to-video tool that uniquely offers start and end frame control, enabling seamless video loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. It also provides AI-generated sound options that are contextually relevant to the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

### Magnific Upscaler: Detail Enhancement
Magnific Upscaler helps to add super rich details to AI-generated visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### CapCut: Adding Text to Video
While AI tools like Runway can be prompted to include text, for precise placement and user control, it's best to export the AI-generated video and use a user-friendly video editing platform like CapCut to add text as an overlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

## Workflow for AI-Generated Visuals

The process of creating stunning visuals is not complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
1.  **Idea Generation**: Start with a basic idea of what you want to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
2.  **Prompt Creation (ChatGPT)**: Use ChatGPT to generate detailed prompts for your idea. It can create several options and add rich descriptive details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
3.  **Style Reference (Pinterest/Saved Images)**: Find a style image on platforms like Pinterest, even if its content is unrelated to your subject, for its aesthetic qualities (colors, shadows, vibe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Save these styles in folders for easy reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
4.  **Image Generation (Midjourney)**: Plug your ChatGPT-generated prompt and chosen style reference into Midjourney to create artistic images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
5.  **Motion Addition (Runway/Cling)**: For video, upload the generated image to Runway or Cling, providing a new ChatGPT-generated prompt for motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
6.  **Upscaling & Enhancements**: Use tools like Magnific Upscaler for higher resolution and richer details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, and CapCut for text overlays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
7.  **Stitching Videos**: To create longer, continuous videos, save the last frame of one AI-generated video as an image and use it as the starting point for the next video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. These can then be stitched together with basic video editing software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

## [[opportunities_for_startups_using_ai_design_tools | Opportunities for Startups and Creatives]]

The biggest [[optimizing_workflow_with_ai_design_tools | opportunity]] for creatives and startups using AI design tools lies in **branding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

### Consistent Asset Generation
AI tools allow for the creation of mood boards in Midjourney, which ensure content continuity and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. By using a mood board's code as a prompt, designers can generate a vast array of related and cohesive content for social media posts, backgrounds, and more, at a very fast pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. This capability to generate consistent assets quickly is a significant leverage point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

### Current Limitations
While powerful, AI design tools still have limitations:
*   **Logo Design**: They are not currently good at logo design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
*   **Vector Art**: They do not produce vector art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
*   **Text Integration**: Text within AI-generated images is not always perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   **Web Design**: The web design side of AI is still developing, with current outputs being "pretty mediocre" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

Therefore, a human designer is still needed for these specific pieces, but once they are set, AI enhances the ability to build additional creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. The most direct [[utilizing_ai_for_marketing_strategies | use case]] for AI-generated videos is often for advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

## Tips for Beginners

*   **Get Hands Dirty**: The most important advice is to start experimenting with the tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
*   **Leverage ChatGPT**: [[utilizing_ai_for_writing_and_content_creation | Utilize ChatGPT]] to help communicate effectively with other AI design tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.
*   **Understand Tool Strengths**: Learn which tools excel at different tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.
*   **Don't Stress Over Too Many Tools**: Pick a few tools you like and learn them thoroughly, rather than trying to master every single one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.
*   **Embrace Imperfection**: Midjourney and Runway are not perfect; they can be finicky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Be prepared to adjust prompts and redo generations if artifacts or unexpected elements appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

With very little effort, anyone can create remarkable and beautiful designs that were previously impossible for most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

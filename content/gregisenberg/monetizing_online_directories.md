Online directories can be highly profitable, with some creators earning $5,000 to $20,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Directories are considered a low-risk startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> and are entering a "Golden Era" due to the public's desire for curated content as internet content grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. People trust well-curated directories that feature quality content, reviews, and ratings from experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies

There are multiple ways to [[monetizing_online_directories_with_display_ads_and_affiliate_programs | monetize online directories]], depending on the audience and niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.

### 1. Banner Spots and Sponsorships (B2B)
For B2B directories, it's easier to monetize by pitching banner spots or sponsor options to businesses that share the same audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. For example, the creator of a GPT directory emailed GPT owners to offer featured spots for a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

### 2. Affiliate Links
[[monetizing_online_directories_with_display_ads_and_affiliate_programs | Affiliate links]] work well if the listed items in the directory are high-ticket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. While low-cost items yield little money, items costing $500 or thousands can generate significant income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>. An example is a directory for Next.js boilerplates with affiliate links to costly products, generating good income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

### 3. Selling Anonymized Data/Insights
It is possible to sell anonymized data or insights derived from the directory to corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. This usually involves pitching larger companies interested in percentages, distributions, and similar data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

### 4. Paywall for Listings
Charging a fee to list items in the directory is a common method, especially if the directory has traffic and buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. For instance, a nanny directory could charge nannies a good amount to be listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. Listing fees can range from $50 to $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.

### 5. Charging for Premium Access
Directories can charge users for full access to the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. For example, a nanny directory might show only basic information (e.g., top five nannies without contact data or photos) and require payment for full access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. Access can be sold for life or on a monthly subscription basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

### 6. Brand Sponsorships
Once a directory becomes large, it can attract big corporate brand sponsors who are interested in brand promotion rather than just traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. For instance, Dev Hunt, a large developer directory, attracts brands like Clerk or Superbase that pay to be affiliated because it's where developers congregate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. This is considered one of the best monetization methods because it's ongoing, doesn't rely on clicks, and is less intrusive than banner ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.

### 7. Indirect Monetization (Channeling Traffic to SaaS)
One powerful indirect monetization strategy is to use directories to channel SEO traffic to other products, such as SaaS tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. It's often harder to gain SEO traffic directly for a SaaS tool with a random brand name that doesn't match keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. Directories, on the other hand, can target non-competitive keywords that VCB companies usually don't pay for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. This provides free traffic that would otherwise be expensive to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.

### 8. Selling the Directory
Directories can be sold, especially to companies with SaaS tools that share the same audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. Selling a directory can be more effective than other marketing methods like [[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | newsletter ads]] because directories tend to be cheaper relative to the traffic they generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. A directory with 100,000 monthly views, bought for around $20,000, could channel 30,000 clicks a year for less than a dollar per click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:42:17]</a>.

#### Directory Valuation
There is no fixed system for valuing directories, as it depends on the audience and traffic quality, not just revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.
*   **Small directories:** $2,000 to $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>
*   **Average directories:** $15,000 to $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>
*   **Larger directories:** Up to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>

#### Where to Buy/Sell Directories
While major marketplaces like Acquire.com often exclude directories due to their lack of direct revenue requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>, smaller marketplaces like Micron.io list them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. A new marketplace specifically for selling directories is also in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. Alternatively, founders can proactively reach out to directory owners after researching their traffic and audience on tools like Similarweb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. This approach can often secure better deals than buying from a listed sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.

## Potential Scale

Online directories, particularly as side projects, can realistically reach $5,000 MRR without needing extreme luck or exceptional intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>. With more time investment, they can grow to $15,000 to $20,000 MRR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. Directories are seen as excellent first attempts at building internet businesses because it's hard to fail, especially when launching multiple directories and investing time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>. Unlike SaaS, where failure means no growing revenue, a directory can generate stable revenue (e.g., $3,000-$4,000/month from ads for a B2B directory with 5,000 monthly visits) that tends to grow passively through [[seo_strategies_for_online_directories | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. Examples of highly successful directories include Starter Story, which is a directory of startup stories generating millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>, and Product Hunt, which started as a simple list of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

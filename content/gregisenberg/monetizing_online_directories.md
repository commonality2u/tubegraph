Online directories are experiencing a "Golden Era" due to increasing demand for curated content on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. People trust directories for well-curated content, reviews, and ratings, often outsourcing decision-making from Google to these platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. They represent a low-risk startup venture with the potential for significant monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Many people are making $5K to $20K a month with online directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It's suggested that an average directory can reach $5K MRR without extraordinary luck or intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. While $20K is often considered the limit for a side project directory, some large directories can scale to millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies for Online Directories

There are multiple ways to monetize online directories, often depending on the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.

### 1. Direct Sponsorships & Featured Listings
For B2B directories, it's easier to monetize by approaching businesses that share the same audience as your directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.
*   **Banner Spots & Sponsor Options** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.
*   **Featured Listings:** Offering a prime position at the top of the directory, as was done with a directory of GPTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. This is a common and effective method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.
*   **Brand Sponsors:** For very large directories, big corporate brands may pay for affiliation, not just clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>. This is an ongoing revenue stream that doesn't significantly detract from user experience, unlike intrusive banners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.

### 2. Affiliate Links
This method works well when the listed items on your directory are high-cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. If items cost $10, you'll earn little, but if they cost $500 or more, there's good money to be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>. An example is a directory for Next.js boilerplates, where affiliate links bring good income because the boilerplates are expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

### 3. Selling Data/Insights
You can sell anonymized data or insights derived from your directory's content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. This usually involves selling to corporates interested in trends, percentages, and distributions within the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

### 4. Paywall for Listings
Charge a fee for businesses or individuals to be listed in your directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. For example, a nanny listed in a directory of nannies might pay a significant amount if the directory has traffic and attracts buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:37:06]</a>. Listings can be charged from $50 to $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.

### 5. Charge for Access (Paywall)
Offer a paywall for access to the full database or detailed contact information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. You might show only a limited number of items or partial data (e.g., nannies without photos or contact details) and require payment to unlock full access, either for a lifetime or monthly subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:48]</a>.

### 6. Indirect Monetization (Channeling Traffic)
If you have other projects, particularly SaaS tools, directories can serve as a powerful free traffic generation channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. It's often much harder to win [[seo_strategies_for_directories | SEO traffic]] for a SaaS tool directly, especially if its brand name doesn't relate to keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:40:02]</a>. Directories can win traffic on less competitive keywords (as there are fewer VC-backed directory competitors) and then channel that traffic to your products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:53]</a>.

### 7. Selling the Directory
Directories can be sold, particularly to companies that have SaaS tools with a similar audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:15]</a>. This is considered a highly effective marketing strategy for SaaS companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:44]</a>.

*   **Valuation:** There's no fixed system for valuing directories; it largely depends on the audience and traffic, rather than just revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:35]</a>.
    *   Small directories with traffic can sell for $2K-$5K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:43:03]</a>.
    *   Average ones go for $15K-$20K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:07]</a>.
    *   Larger ones can reach up to $100K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:12]</a>.
    *   Buying a directory with 100K monthly views for $20K could yield 30K clicks a year to a linked product, equating to less than $1 per click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:42:17]</a>.
*   **Marketplaces:** While larger marketplaces like Acquire.com might not list directories due to their revenue requirements, smaller marketplaces sometimes feature them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:57]</a>. One example mentioned is Microacquire.io <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:06]</a>.
*   **Direct Outreach:** A more effective strategy to acquire a directory is to use tools like Similarweb to research their traffic and audience, then directly reach out to the founders with an offer to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:34]</a>. Founders who haven't listed their directory for sale might be more open to a reasonable offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:55]</a>.

> [!tip] Low-Risk Startup
> Starting with a directory as your first attempt to build an internet business is highly recommended. It's much harder to fail with directories if you launch enough of them and invest a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:47:07]</a>. A stable 5K visits per month for a B2B directory can yield $3K-$4K per month from ads, and this can grow even if you do nothing, due to the nature of [[seo_strategies_for_directories | SEO]] on non-competitive keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:40]</a>.

> You will also gain domain authority and traffic faster, and potentially secure early sponsorships, compared to starting a SaaS business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:48:05]</a>. Notable examples of directories that have grown into multi-million dollar businesses include Starter Story and Product Hunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:35]</a>.

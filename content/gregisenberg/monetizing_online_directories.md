[[building_a_profitable_online_directory | Online directories]] offer a low-risk opportunity for startups, with some creators earning significant monthly incomes, such as $5K, $10K, $15K, or even $20K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The focus for a new directory should initially be on validating potential SEO traffic and user interest for about 30 days before diving into data quality and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

## [[monetization_strategies_for_directory_businesses | Monetization Strategies for Directories]]

There are multiple ways to [[monetization_strategies_for_directory_businesses | monetize online directories]], depending on the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>:

*   **Banners and Sponsorships**
    *   For B2B directories, it's easier to monetize by pitching businesses that share the same audience for banner spots or sponsor options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.
    *   An example given is an "all GPTs" directory where GPT owners were offered featured spots at the top for a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.
    *   Brand sponsors (big companies) are willing to pay for brand promotion and affiliation, even without direct clicks, providing ongoing income without destroying the user experience with overly intrusive ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. For instance, Dev Hunt, a large directory, secures ongoing sponsorships from major brands like Clerk and Superbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

*   **Affiliate Links**
    *   This method works well if the items listed in the directory are expensive, ranging from $500 to thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.
    *   An example is a directory for Next.js boilerplates that uses affiliate links, generating good income due to the high cost of the products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

*   **Selling Data and Insights**
    *   Anonymized data or insights gathered from the directory can be sold, particularly to corporations interested in market trends or distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

*   **Paywalls for Listings**
    *   Charging a fee for businesses or individuals to be listed in the directory is a common monetization strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>.
    *   For example, a directory for nannies could charge nannies a listing fee if it consistently attracts buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.

*   **Paywalls for User Access**
    *   Users can be charged for full access to the directory's database or contact information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.
    *   For instance, a nanny directory might show only the top five listings or limited information (e.g., no photos or contact data) and require payment to unlock full access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.

*   **Channeling Traffic to SaaS Tools**
    *   A directory can be used to capture SEO traffic for non-competitive keywords, which is often easier than gaining SEO for a SaaS tool directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.
    *   This traffic is then channeled from the directory to the creator's SaaS product, acting as a free traffic source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. SaaS products often face high competition for keywords from venture capital-backed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.

*   **Selling the Directory**
    *   Directories can be sold to companies that have SaaS tools targeting the same audience, allowing them to channel traffic to their own products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.
    *   This strategy is considered more effective than newsletter ads for acquiring traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.
    *   Pricing for directories varies widely and is not typically based on traditional revenue multiples, but rather on audience relevance and traffic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
    *   Reported sales prices range from $2K for smaller directories, an average of $15K-$20K, and up to $100K for larger ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>.
    *   Marketplaces like Micron.io list smaller directories for sale, but a common approach is to identify promising directories via tools like Similarweb and make a direct offer to the founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

## Income Potential

For individuals managing directories as side projects (e.g., alongside a main job or other projects), a monthly recurring revenue (MRR) of $5K is considered achievable without needing excessive luck or being exceptionally smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. This can potentially scale to $10K or even $15K-$20K with more dedicated effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

Compared to starting a SaaS business, directories have a significantly lower risk of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>. Even a B2B directory with a stable 5K monthly visits can easily secure four or five ads, generating $3K-$4K per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>. Due to their tendency to rank for non-competitive keywords, SEO traffic for directories often continues to grow even with minimal ongoing effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>.

Notable examples of successful directories include Starter Story (a directory of startup stories) which generates millions, and Product Hunt, which initially started as a simple list of products before evolving into a voting system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.

In the dynamic world of [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_ideas | entrepreneurship]], identifying trends is crucial, but recognizing and capitalizing on **antitrends** can unlock even more compelling opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. An antitrend is the opposite direction of a prevailing trend, and it can be a source of highly interesting [[strategies_for_identifying_saas_startup_opportunities | startup ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Identifying Antitrends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>

[[identifying_and_capitalizing_on_antitrends | Identifying and capitalizing on antitrends]] involves looking for the counter-narrative or the opposing demand to what is currently popular. This approach often leads to less competition and the ability to command a premium price for services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

### Case Study: AI Coaching vs. Human Coaching

A prominent trend is the rise of [[ai_impact_on_startups_and_trades | AI coaching apps]] like Riz and Plug AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, which leverage large language models (like ChatGPT) for services such as dating advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, life advice (Astra) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, and personalized style suggestions (Pallet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. These apps are simple in their technological build, focusing on strong branding, positioning, and referral flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. For example, Plug AI, an [[AI startup ideas and incubation | AI dating coach]] app, achieved $190,000 per month in revenue and 333,000 downloads per month, with its founder finding the idea on a Tinder subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This company, AI Riz, manages three apps nearing $500,000 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

The **antitrend** to this [[ai_impact_on_startups_and_trades | AI-driven coaching]] is the demand for human-led coaching and advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. While AI offers scalability, human interaction provides a level of connection and nuance that AI currently cannot replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

*   **Opportunity:** A human version of these AI apps could charge a premium and capture a significant market share by offering personalized human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. For instance, an "anti-Pallet app" could feature an influencer providing real voice messages and direct advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. The developer of an AI app could even offer a premium upgrade to human coaching within their existing platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

### Case Study: Biohacking and Longevity vs. Hedonism

Another example is the trend of biohacking and longevity, epitomized by figures like Brian Johnson, who seeks to optimize his health and extend his lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Johnson successfully built a business around this trend, selling $1.5 million worth of supplements and olive oil in one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

The **antitrend** is a lifestyle focused on hedonism and enjoying life to the fullest, even if it means a shorter lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

*   **Opportunity:** An "anti-Brian Johnson" figure or brand could emerge, celebrating indulgence and chronicling the opposite of health optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. This highlights that any strong trend can generate an equally strong counter-demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

## Practicality in Startup Ventures

While some critics argue against building businesses on "hypey" or "flash-in-the-pan" concepts, there's a strong argument for the practical benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

> "Sometimes you need to change your world before you change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

*   **Financial Stability:** For many, the initial goal of a startup is to achieve financial stability, which can mean generating enough capital to retire parents, support a cause, or buy a first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. If a venture, even a "hypey" one, can generate millions in profit within a year, it provides a crucial "first nut" â€“ a base of capital for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **Skill Development:** Building and scaling any business, regardless of its longevity, teaches invaluable entrepreneurial skills that are transferable to future ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
*   **Diversification:** Smart entrepreneurs mitigate risks by diversifying their efforts across multiple apps or projects in different verticals, rather than putting "all eggs in one basket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Opportunity Identification

*   **Non-obvious Use Cases:** When exploring new technologies like [[ai_impact_on_startups_and_trades | AI]], focus on non-obvious use cases rather than saturated areas like dating or therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Reddit & Google Trends:** Subscribing to relevant subreddits (e.g., r/SaaS) can provide insights into emerging trends and specific problems people are trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. While not explicitly mentioned, [[leveraging_google_trends_for_startup_ideas | Google Trends]] can also be a valuable tool for identifying interest shifts.
*   **Less Competition:** [[Antitrends in startups | Antitrends]] often present opportunities with significantly less competition compared to mainstream trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal for many in [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_ideas | entrepreneurship]] is to achieve financial practicality and create a foundation for future endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. By understanding and embracing [[identifying_and_capitalizing_on_antitrends | antitrends]], founders can discover unique paths to success and build sustainable businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

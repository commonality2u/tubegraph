This article explores how to [[building_apps_using_ai_tools | build applications]] and [[building_businesses_with_ai_tools | businesses using AI tools]] by leveraging Google's AI Studio and Gemini models, as presented by Logan Kilpatrick, Lead Product Manager for Google's AI Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The focus is on enabling developers and startups to utilize powerful, often free, AI capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>.

## Google AI Studio

Google AI Studio is designed to showcase the full capabilities of Google's AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. It is free to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Key Features
*   **Default Experience**: Provides a basic prompting interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Prompt Gallery**: Offers a wide range of examples, from creating trip ideas to optimizing code and extracting information from images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Model Showcase**: Displays all available Gemini and Gemma (open-source) models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Gemini Models

The Gemini models power the AI Studio experience, offering differentiated capabilities not possible with other AI services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Developers can access an API key for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:07">[02:50:07]</a>.

### Available Models

*   **Flashlight**: Higher rate limits, slightly less intelligent, but capable of core functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Pro Model**: An experimental variant and the most intelligent model available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Reasoning Model**: Available for free for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

> [!INFO] Model Capabilities
> These models enable unique features like long context processing and advanced reasoning, which are crucial for [[building_ai_applications_without_extensive_coding_knowledge | building AI applications without extensive coding knowledge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Key Capabilities for Application Building

Google AI Studio and Gemini models unlock powerful capabilities for [[building_apps_using_ai_tools | app development]].

### Long Context Processing
Gemini models excel at processing long inputs, such as 30-minute videos or extensive audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This allows for tasks like extracting information from a video tour of a museum or intelligence from podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Business Application
> This capability can be used to extract data from various media formats to create [[building_automated_businesses_with_ai | online directories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Such data extraction would be nearly impossible without these models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Reasoning Models
Reasoning models allow the AI to "think" before generating a final output, similar to outlining a project or code structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This process involves the model considering desired outcomes, necessary code, technology stack, and MVP functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Automated Development
> A reasoning model can convert a simple code snippet into a fully-fledged website, landing page, and [[integrating_ai_tools_in_building_saas_startups | SaaS app]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This capability is accessible for free through AI Studio's API key, usable in coding environments like Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

### Spatial Understanding (Multimodal Capabilities)
This capability allows the model to deeply understand and visually represent different objects within an image, including generating 2D bounding boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

> [!TIP] Business Ideas from Spatial Understanding
> *   **E-commerce**: Identifying and cropping furniture items from a busy room photo for reverse image search to sell furniture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
> *   **Inventory Management**: Snapping pictures or using real-time video feeds to monitor item utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
> *   **Urban Planning**: Real-time monitoring of parking garage utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
> *   **Satellite Analysis**: Bounding specific areas like corn fields for meta-analyses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
>
> Many service-based businesses can be automated by leveraging this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

### Native Function Calling
This feature enables the integration of AI with existing products, creating new experiences by combining functionalities that historically lived separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Geoguesser with Google Maps
> By hooking up AI Studio and Gemini to the Google Maps API, a "geoguesser" experience can be built, allowing users to explore locations based on prompts like "take me somewhere in ancient history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This demonstrates how combining five different products with AI in the middle can form a real business with minimal work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

### Real-time Streaming (Multimodal Live API)
This API powers an AI "co-presence" experience, where the AI can see what the user sees and provide real-time, context-aware assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] AI Pair Programming
> Imagine an AI senior developer in your IDE, seeing your screen, understanding your code, and providing real-time pair programming assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. This capability makes work faster (1.5x, 2x, 3x faster) and helps democratize access to coding knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. It can also browse the internet to find solutions to errors within the product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

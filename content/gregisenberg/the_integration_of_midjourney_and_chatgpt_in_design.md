Brett from Designjoy, a one-man designer, utilizes AI to create remarkable designs, showcasing how accessible and powerful these tools have become for generating graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The process for generating beautiful graphics is surprisingly simple, with no hidden magic; the tools themselves are incredibly powerful and easy to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Ease of AI Design for Non-Designers
These AI generation tools are designed to be accessible to anyone, not just professional designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. With a [[Using midjourney for AI design | Midjourney]] or ChatGPT subscription, prior design knowledge is not required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. While having good taste helps, there's no "skill issue" for non-creatives looking to use these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Getting Started with AI Creation
To begin with AI creation, especially for those with no experience, simpler tools like Higsfield can be a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Higsfield: Template-Based AI Generation
Higsfield provides numerous templates, simplifying the process of telling AI what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This tool is designed to meet users at their level, offering preset actions and effects without needing complex director-like language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. For example, by selecting a preset and uploading a product picture, Higsfield can generate a professional advertisement video that considers the product's branding and even correctly displays text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This makes it ideal for quickly creating cool ads for platforms like Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Core Integration: Midjourney and ChatGPT
While tools like Higsfield are great for quick product ads, the true power and fun lie in combining [[Using midjourney for AI design | ChatGPT]] and [[Using midjourney for AI design | Midjourney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Despite the proliferation of many AI tools, the speaker primarily relies on Midjourney and ChatGPT due to their combined effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Midjourney's Strengths
[[Using midjourney for AI design | Midjourney]] excels at artistic styling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It's the go-to tool for creating artistic images, such as Kodak vintage aerial photos of a golf course or brand directions for a surfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### ChatGPT's Role
[[Chat GPT and AI training | ChatGPT]] is used when very specific image details are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. For instance, to insert a realistic golfer into an existing image, ChatGPT can achieve more realistic results than Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Combined Workflow: Prompting with ChatGPT
The effectiveness of these AI systems depends entirely on the quality of the prompts and reference images provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Historically, [[Prompting techniques for ChatGPT 4o | prompting techniques for ChatGPT]] was considered a specialized skill, requiring author-level writing and visualization abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. However, with the advancement of [[Chat GPT and AI training | ChatGPT]], prompting is no longer a gatekept skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. ChatGPT is highly adept at generating detailed and well-crafted prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

#### Example: Generating Cowboy Art
To generate specific images, such as a zoomed-in photo of a cowboy holding reins, a simple request to ChatGPT will yield several well-written prompt options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Users can then talk back to ChatGPT, iterating on the prompt to refine the image, for example, by asking for a zoomed-in shot of a cowboy's hat or a horse's face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. ChatGPT adds rich, extra detail that enhances the image quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. It can even dream up entire collections of scenes based on a core idea, saving users from writing individual specific prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

### Leveraging Image and Style References in Midjourney
[[Balancing text prompts and visual styles in midjourney | Midjourney]] allows the use of two types of references:
*   **Image Prompts**: Inserting a photo (e.g., a surfer) will influence the generated image to include similar elements (person, surfboard, greenery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Style References**: Uploading a style image ensures that the generated image adopts its colors, shadows, highlights, and depth of field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Users can mix different style references (e.g., an orange style with a green style) to create surprising and unique generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Pinterest is an excellent resource for finding stylistic directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Beyond Image Generation: Adding Motion and Post-Processing
Once images are generated in [[Using midjourney for AI design | Midjourney]], they can be taken further by integrating other AI tools.

### Runway: Adding Motion to Images
Images from Midjourney can be uploaded to Runway to add motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. [[Chat GPT and AI training | ChatGPT]] can assist by generating a prompt for Runway, instructing it on what specific movements to apply to the image (e.g., "soft ripples in the water," "smoke coming," "trees blowing softly in the wind") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Runway (and similar tools like Cling and Korea) are top-tier for quality video generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

> "Keep the camera completely still for a piece. See it even get it even understands that. So there's not this all this movement around." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>

Videos generated by these tools typically run for 5 to 10 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. For sharing on platforms like X, a square aspect ratio is preferred to avoid black borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.
While powerful, AI tools like Midjourney and Runway are not always perfect and may produce unexpected artifacts or require prompt adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

### Enhancing Videos with Other Tools
*   **Cling**: Another image-to-video tool that supports start and end frames, allowing for seamless video looping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Cling also offers an AI sound button that generates context-aware audio options for the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Magnific Upscaler**: Used to enhance images with super rich details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Video Editing Tools**: For longer, continuous shots, users can save the last frame of a generated video, upload it as the starting image for the next video, and then stitch multiple clips together using a simple video editing tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.
*   **Cap Cut**: A user-friendly video platform for adding text layers on top of generated videos, which is often easier than trying to generate text directly within AI video tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

## Opportunities for Startups and Creatives
The integration of AI in design, particularly [[Using AI for app design and functionality | AI design]] and "vibe designing," presents significant opportunities for startups and creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

### Branding as a Key Leverage Point
The biggest opportunity lies in branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. While web design hasn't fully matured with AI yet (tools like Bolt and Lovable still produce mediocre output), branding is where AI truly shines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

[[Using midjourney for AI design | Midjourney]] allows users to set up a mood board from a single preferred asset, creating a consistent code that can be used for all future prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. This ensures continuity and consistency across all generated content, enabling the rapid creation of cohesive brand assets for social media posts or other purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.

> "The ability for you to take those references and continue to build new additional creatives off of it is really really where the opportunity is today." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>

However, current AI tools have limitations: they are not good for logo design, cannot generate an entire brand, text isn't always perfect, and they don't do vector art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. Therefore, traditional designers are still needed for certain elements, but once those foundational pieces are set, AI significantly accelerates the creation of consistent additional creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. This ability to [[Generating engaging visual content with ChatGPT | generate engaging visual content]] and consistent assets at a very quick pace is the main leverage point of AI in design today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

## Practical Demonstration of Workflow
Creating a beautiful AI-generated video can be done quickly, even by non-designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

1.  **Find a Reference Image**: Start by finding a suitable image, for example, a cabin picture from Pinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
2.  **Select a Style Reference**: Choose a saved style image to influence the generated image's aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
3.  **Generate Prompt with ChatGPT**: Use [[Chat GPT and AI training | ChatGPT]] to create a simple prompt for the desired image, specifying what to include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. ChatGPT is sophisticated enough to understand simple instructions and expand upon them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
4.  **Generate Image in Midjourney**: Plug the generated prompt and style reference into [[Using midjourney for AI design | Midjourney]] to create the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
5.  **Generate Video Prompt with ChatGPT**: Take the generated image and ask [[Chat GPT and AI training | ChatGPT]] to provide a prompt for a video tool like Runway, detailing specific movements (e.g., "soft ripples in the water," "smoke coming," "trees blowing softly in the wind") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. ChatGPT even understands the specific tool (Runway) and formats the prompt accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
6.  **Generate Video in Runway**: Upload the image to Runway, paste the ChatGPT-generated prompt, and select desired settings (e.g., square aspect ratio, 10 seconds duration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. The video can then be upscaled to 4K with a single click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.
7.  **Post-Processing for Ads**: For adding text, the generated video can be exported and brought into a user-friendly video platform like Cap Cut, where text layers can be easily added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. This allows for precise positioning of text, which is not easily done within AI video generation tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

By following these steps, a beautiful video can be created in approximately 5-6 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

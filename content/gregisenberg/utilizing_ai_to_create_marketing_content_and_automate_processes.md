The traditional marketing funnel is an outdated concept for modern marketing, described as "entirely the wrong way to think about marketing" because it is a "deceptive way to kind of hide what's actually happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Instead, a new approach called "digital gravity" is proposed, focusing on building "digital Mass on the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The more mass a brand has, the more influence it exerts within its niche. This mass is built through content and extensive marketing, essentially being present everywhere the customer is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Modern marketing requires continuous effort rather than starting and stopping campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Companies should constantly run ads and test variations to optimize for impact and conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This continuous approach is vital because, unlike email which is irreversible once sent, most digital marketing efforts are "malleable" and can be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The focus is on increasing volume, especially in short-form social media, where a higher quantity of content leads to better engagement and results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Older brands' strategies of one Instagram account or one blog post a week are considered "old school" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Applications of AI in Marketing Strategies

### AI-Powered Ad Creation and Testing
For both B2B and B2C marketing, AI can significantly enhance content creation and automation.
- **AI Avatar Ads**: For B2B, a key strategy involves running **UGC AI Avatar ads** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
  - **Tools**: [[Using AI for writing and content creation | HeyGen]] is recommended for its high-quality avatar creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, and [[Using AI for writing and content creation | Eleven Labs]] for voice synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
  - **Process**: Create up to 100 different variations of an ad, testing various hooks, settings, backgrounds, and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. The budget should be allocated primarily to the best-performing variants (e.g., 80% to top performers, 20% for continuous testing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This ensures continuous optimization.
  - **Founder Visibility**: Founders are encouraged to create a digital clone of themselves for these ads to become "famous through these ads to your target audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This leverages the principle that "people buy from people not Brands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. If a founder isn't featured, the AI avatar's angle should be problem/solution oriented with a storytelling format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

### Content Automation and Distribution
A comprehensive content strategy, often enabled by AI, is crucial for building digital mass.
- **Podcast and Newsletter**: Record customer conversations to create a podcast, then send it out to an entire scraped email list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
  - **Tools**: MailerLite and Beehiive are examples of email sending services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
  - This transforms the company into a media entity, creating leverage within the industry and turning a cost center into a profit center by monetizing the audience through ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. For example, a company was able to subsidize its entire growth team's cost through media production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
- **Content Repurposing with AI**: Podcast content can be repurposed into various formats.
  - **Tools**: Swell AI was built specifically for this purpose, enabling clipping, show notes generation, and media asset creation from video podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.
  - **Process**: Extract pain points, create transcripts, generate blog posts, and white papers from the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. These assets can then be scheduled across all relevant platforms like LinkedIn and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
- **Short-Form Content**: Take working short-form content from TikTok or Instagram Reels and repurpose them for LinkedIn to achieve viral reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
  - For consumer products, spawn multiple TikTok accounts (e.g., 10) and create variations of best-performing UGC content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
  - **Tools**: [[Using AI in Content Creation | ChatGPT]] can be used to change scripts, [[Using AI in Content Creation | HeyGen]] for videos, and [[Using AI in Content Creation | Eleven Labs]] for audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. [[Using AI in Content Creation | CapCut]] can be used for green screen removal to place the AI Avatar over app interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.

### Programmatic SEO with AI
For consumer products, [[Effective content creation using AI for marketing | programmatic SEO]] is a powerful strategy once the app gains domain authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
- **Process**:
  1. Identify low-competition, long-tail keywords relevant to the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.
  2. Scrape top-ranking content for those keywords on page one of search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.
  3. Use an AI tool to create a blog post outline and then write the article section by section based on the scraped content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
  4. Publish a high volume of articles (e.g., 10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.
  5. Once a page starts receiving traffic, a human SEO specialist or content writer revises it for quality and readability, ensuring it ranks well with Google and engages human readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.
  6. Include clear calls to action within the content, such as after the first paragraph and as a pop-up at a 25-50% scroll rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.

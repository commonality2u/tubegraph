Manis AI is a Chinese AI application that aims to transform ideas into fully automated businesses and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It reportedly can build a business with just a few prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Min Choy, a user who gained early access, described Manis AI as an advanced agent AI, capable of running tasks and tools, hinting at a glimpse into [[using_ai_tools_for_app_functionality_and_innovation | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Its core purpose is to help entrepreneurs [[using_manus_ai_for_business_planning | kickstart their ideas into action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Core Functionality and User Experience

Manis AI features an interface similar to ChatGPT, with a simple chat window where users input requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Under the hood, Manis operates as a multi-agent system, incorporating a planner and executor, reminiscent of early Baby AGI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. It takes a user's request, researches the necessary components, and then plans, designs, and executes the creation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. It also includes a "human in the loop" feature, allowing users to intervene and adjust the process as needed, even in the middle of a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

Instead of requiring users to employ multiple AI tools for different stages (like idea generation, design, and deployment), Manis AI consolidates these functions. It creates a virtual sandbox to run command-line executions, operate a browser for research and data scraping, and utilize various tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This means it handles everything from research and planning to execution, including setting up project structures for applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

A key advantage noted is the ease of use for non-technical individuals, as it removes the burden of complex prompting or understanding intricate technical processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. Users can start with very simple requests, and Manis will iteratively refine the output, learning from interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

## Demonstrated Use Cases

### DocuSign Clone Attempt

The demonstration began with an ambitious goal: to create a clone of DocuSign, aiming to disrupt its multi-billion dollar market by offering a free or low-cost electronic signature solution that could generate $1,000 per day in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The initial prompt was "create a DocuSign clone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Manis AI immediately began researching DocuSign's core features, user flows, and technical requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The user then clarified that only the "E-signature" functionality was desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, and Manis adjusted its plan accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. It proceeded to set up a typical Next.js app, including routes, login/registration pages, passwords, and middleware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.

Despite successfully generating the code, Manis encountered issues during the public deployment phase and suggested a local deployment instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. The process was not fully completed live, but the ability to generate the core code for a complex application was demonstrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>.

### Researching Startup Ideas

Another test involved asking Manis to research startup ideas from various online platforms (X, YouTube, personal website) and identify those with the highest potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Manis demonstrated its web browsing capabilities by navigating the user's website, X (formerly Twitter) profile, and YouTube channel to gather information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. It even clicked a link in the user's bio that offered "free startup ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

However, this task eventually led to a critical error, with Manis reporting that its "computer has encountered a critical issue" and asking to reset or start a new session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. This highlighted a limitation related to processing "extremely long context" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.

### Improving SEO for a Design Agency

Manis AI was also tested on its ability to help [[creating_content_with_ai_tools | improve SEO]] for a design agency website, with a specific focus on attracting executives from AI-first tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Manis confirmed its understanding of the specific goal and proceeded with the SEO analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>.

### Creating an Airplane Game

A final demonstration involved prompting Manis to create an airplane game similar to fly.peter.com using 3js <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. Although an initial attempt was blocked by a "maximum daily usage limit" (which is 10 sessions per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>, a loophole was found by starting a new session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>.

After the recording, the flight game was successfully created and deployed through a single prompt. While it was a more basic version than Peter Levels' game, it was fully functional and playable in a web browser, allowing the plane to fly and shoot down balloons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

## Limitations and Concerns

Despite its impressive capabilities, the demonstration revealed several limitations:

*   **Context Window Issues**: Manis AI struggles with "extremely long context," leading to performance decline and errors when tasks become overly complex or involve extensive information processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. This requires users to restart sessions, losing progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.
*   **Deployment Challenges**: While it can generate code, the deployment process to a public network is not always seamless, often encountering issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.
*   **Scalability**: As a beta product with invitation-only access, Manis AI has shown signs of scaling issues. Frequent errors have increased as more users gain access to the system, suggesting the infrastructure struggles under heavier load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Data Privacy Concerns**: As a Chinese company, there are concerns about data privacy, given that Chinese companies are obligated to provide access to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. Users are advised to be very careful with personal information and sensitive data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.

## Conclusion

Manis AI is considered one of the closest technologies to [[using_ai_tools_for_app_functionality_and_innovation | AGI]] currently available, offering a powerful abstraction layer for [[using_ai_to_build_software_applications | building and deploying applications]] and automating complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. Its ability to act as a multi-role "employee" (researcher, marketer, developer) simultaneously is a significant advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>. While still in beta with notable limitations, particularly regarding complex contexts and seamless deployment, it demonstrates a promising future for AI-powered business creation and automation, especially for non-technical users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>.

This article explores [[Pricing strategies for app development projects]] for individuals or small teams, focusing on earning through platforms like Upwork and by offering custom solutions.

## Earning Potential on Upwork
It's possible for solo developers or small teams to make significant income by selling AI services on platforms like Upwork, with some reportedly earning $5,000 to $20,000 a month [00:00:19]. The core idea is to find a business problem and offer a custom app solution, often by replacing existing, more expensive software [00:00:45].

## Finding Opportunities and Setting Prices
A key strategy for successful [[marketing_and_selling_apps | app sales]] is to find clients who are already willing to buy an app *before* building it [00:02:24]. Upwork can serve as a marketplace to identify these needs, especially by looking for jobs requesting specific technologies that can be replaced with a custom app [00:02:41].

### Competitive Advantage
Offering a cheaper, custom alternative to existing software, like replacing an Airtable setup that costs $20 per seat, can be a strong selling point [00:03:08].

### Pricing Projects
When evaluating project listings, especially on platforms like Upwork:
*   **Initial Offers**: A listed price like $125 for a fixed project might be considered too low [00:06:34], particularly if the client typically seeks overseas help [00:06:58].
*   **Proposing Higher**: Developers can submit proposals that are priced higher than the client's initial budget, hoping the client will accept the higher rate [00:07:00].
*   **Experience-Based Pricing**: An early project successfully sold for $750, though this was later considered underpriced [00:07:40]. Developers should aim for higher amounts [00:07:46].
*   **Recurring Revenue**: Beyond the initial project fee, consider opportunities for recurring revenue by offering to add future features or charging for hosting [00:07:53].
*   **Market Due Diligence**: If a listed price is low, search for similar requests on the platform to see if others are willing to pay more for the same type of service [00:08:30]. Projects offering $2,500 for custom workflows are considered acceptable targets [00:10:05].

### Upwork Costs
Applying for jobs on Upwork requires "connects" (credits), which cost a small amount (e.g., $2-3 for some applications) [00:07:12]. Boosting a proposal to the top of a client's inbox is also an option [00:07:21].

## Revenue Potential
For a solo developer, earning $5,000 to $10,000 a month is achievable without external help by building apps or consulting on specific SaaS platforms [00:24:50]. Agencies with a team can achieve six-figure earnings [00:23:55].

## Ongoing Support and Business Models
Building an app for a client also creates an opportunity to charge for ongoing support and future feature requests, essentially acting as a development agency for specific clients [00:38:40]. This provides stable income and helps maintain client relationships.

### Service vs. SaaS
The speaker differentiates between service-based app development (consulting/building custom apps for specific clients) and building a Software as a Service (SaaS) product:
*   **Service Model (Easy Mode)**: Getting paid for a service, like custom app development for businesses, is considered the "easiest" mode due to direct payment and reduced [[strategies_for_successful_consumer_app_growth | risk]] [00:34:09].
*   **B2B SaaS (Medium Mode)**: Building a SaaS for businesses (e.g., 10 clients paying $1,000/month) is a medium difficulty [00:34:16].
*   **B2C SaaS (Hard Mode)**: Creating a consumer-facing viral app (like Calai, a calorie tracking app) is considered "hard mode" due to significant [[marketing_strategies_for_saas_apps | marketing]] investment and the challenge of building mass distribution [00:29:31]. The path to success is highly risky for B2C apps compared to B2B or service models [00:34:52].

### Derisking Projects
A significant advantage of the service-based approach is the ability to derisk projects by securing an upfront price from the client before committing to development [00:34:57]. This contrasts with the higher risk associated with building a SaaS product without guaranteed revenue.

### Unbundling Existing SaaS
An emerging [[innovative_app_development_strategies | strategy]] is to "unbundle" existing SaaS products. This involves leveraging public APIs to recreate specific functionalities of a larger SaaS solution, potentially offering it at a much lower cost [00:35:43]. This isn't about direct duplication, but rather re-engineering parts of a service using available data, or offering a niche-specific version [00:37:14].

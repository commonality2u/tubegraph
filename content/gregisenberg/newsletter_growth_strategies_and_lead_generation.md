Building an email-based business, such as a newsletter, is a recommended strategy for reaching a monthly income of $10K-$20K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Platforms like Beehiiv simplify the process of growing from zero to 100,000 subscribers and achieving significant monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Tyler Denk, co-founder of Beehiiv and formerly instrumental in Morning Brew's growth to 3.5 million subscribers, shares insights on how to build and monetize email newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Starting an Email-Based Business
The co-founder of Beehiiv, Tyler Denk, grew his personal newsletter, "Big Desk Energy," from zero to 90,000 subscribers in 14 months, generating between $20,000 and $30,000 per month as a side project with about five hours of work per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This demonstrates the potential for [[building_an_emailbased_business_with_newsletters | building an email-based business with newsletters]] and significant [[how_to_monetize_newsletters | monetization through newsletters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Website as Top of Funnel for [[building_audience_and_lead_generation | Lead Generation]]
The newsletter's website serves as the primary entry point for new subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Beehiiv offers a comprehensive website builder that allows for fully customizable sites, including subscribe pages and content archives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Key features for [[building_audience_and_lead_generation | lead generation]] include:
*   **Website Builder** The platform's native website builder allows for customization of pages and content, enabling users to create a unique brand presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. When a newsletter is published, it simultaneously creates a web version, optimizing for SEO and centralizing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Email Capture Pop-ups** Customizable pop-ups can be configured to appear on specific pages or based on traffic sources (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), significantly improving conversion rates from 10% to 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Integrated Data Analytics** The platform tracks subscriber and visitor origins (e.g., X, LinkedIn), and their on-site and in-email behavior, providing valuable data for understanding the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Customizing the Subscriber Experience
Optimizing the post-signup experience is crucial for engagement and data collection.

*   **Custom Signup Flows** Publishers can create tailored signup flows, including interstitial steps like recommending other newsletters (see [[monetization_through_newsletters | Boost Network]] below) or surveys to gather subscriber data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Different flows can be assigned based on the acquisition source (e.g., Twitter vs. LinkedIn) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Automated Welcome Series** Automated email journeys, ranging from simple welcome emails to multi-step sequences, can be set up immediately after a subscriber signs up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This series helps build trust, humanize the brand, and prompt immediate actions like referrals or purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Subscriber Surveys** Collecting demographic data (e.g., age, role, skill set) through surveys at the point of conversion is highly underrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This data informs content creation, [[how_to_monetize_newsletters | monetization strategies]], and understanding the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. Follow-up emails can be sent to those who skipped the survey, emphasizing the value of providing data (e.g., for job opportunities, fundraise deal flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. About 30% of subscribers complete these follow-up surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## Growth Strategies: Network Effects

### Recommendation Network
Beehiiv's native recommendation network allows publishers to organically recommend other newsletters within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. In return, other newsletters can recommend Big Desk Energy, leading to passive growth of hundreds of subscribers per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. This "time in market" strategy, building over 14 months, results in free, high-quality subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.

### Boost Network (Paid Acquisition)
The Boost Network is a two-sided marketplace within Beehiiv for [[user_acquisition_and_growth_strategies | user acquisition and growth strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
*   **Monetizing Referrals:** Publishers can explore offers from other newsletters willing to pay per subscriber for promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. For example, some offers pay $2-$4 per lead for subscribers who opt-in to an additional subscription after signing up for the main newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.
*   **Acquiring Subscribers:** Publishers can set a budget to acquire subscribers from other newsletters within the Boost Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.
    *   **Quality Control:** The system verifies subscribers, only charging if they are engaged (e.g., open emails) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. This acts like a risk-free advertising model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
    *   **Auto-Pause Feature:** Publishers can set thresholds (e.g., 30% open rate), and the system will automatically pause campaigns from underperforming channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
    *   **Application Filters:** When accepting publishers to promote a newsletter, filters can be applied based on language, geography, number of posts, engagement (open rate), and "Boost quality" score, ensuring high-quality leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

This system creates a "vending machine" effect: if a publisher knows they can make more money (e.g., $4) from a subscriber than they pay to acquire them (e.g., $2.50), they can scale their [[marketing_strategies_for_newsletters | marketing strategies for newsletters]] by continuously investing in acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.

## Growth Strategies: Lead Magnets
A [[building_audience_and_lead_generation | lead magnet]] is a digital (or physical) asset that people sign up to receive, related to the main offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. This is one of the best channels for growing a newsletter, especially in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.

*   **Implementation:** Publishers can create custom pages on Beehiiv for lead magnets, which then trigger a specific, simplified signup flow and an automated email delivering the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **Targeted Value:** The lead magnet should be highly relevant to the desired audience. For example, offering a seed deck used for fundraising will attract founders and investors, who are the target audience for a newsletter about startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.
*   **[[using_ads_and_content_for_lead_generation | Monetization]] Opportunity:** Once a lead magnet consistently drives sign-ups, it can be sponsored by relevant companies or VC firms whose target audience aligns with those interested in the lead magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. The sponsorship revenue can then be reinvested into paid promotion of the lead magnet, creating a self-sustaining [[b2b_growth_and_content_strategies | B2B growth and content strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.

## Growth Strategies: Referral Programs
Referral programs incentivize existing readers to share the newsletter, leveraging super fans into a growth channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.
*   **Native Platform Support:** Beehiiv offers a native referral program feature that tracks referrals and automatically delivers rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.
*   **Low-Cost Rewards:** Digital goods (e.g., PDFs, exclusive content) or promo codes for drop-shipped merchandise minimize costs and logistical effort compared to physical goods like t-shirts or mugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
*   **Simple Milestones:** Offering a valuable reward for just one referral teaches users how the program works and makes it easy to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. The "Milk Road" crypto newsletter grew significantly by offering a PDF of crypto predictions for just one referral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
*   **In-Newsletter Integration:** Referral sections can be seamlessly embedded into every newsletter, providing readers with their unique referral link and tracking progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Program Integration:** A creative strategy is to offer discounts or access to a valuable affiliate program (e.g., Beehiiv's own 50% revenue share partner program) as a referral reward, generating revenue for the publisher while acquiring new subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.

## Growth Strategies: Email Gating Content
Publishers can use their newsletter content itself as a [[building_audience_and_lead_generation | lead generation]] tool by gating web articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.
*   **Mechanism:** When a user clicks on a newsletter post on the website, they are prompted to subscribe to read the full content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.
*   **Promotion:** Publishers can hype up upcoming content on social media (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn), driving traffic to the gated web version of their newsletter, effectively turning every new post into a constant [[building_audience_and_lead_generation | lead magnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.

## Monetization Overview
Beehiiv offers multiple avenues for [[how_to_monetize_newsletters | monetizing newsletters]]:
1.  **Paid Subscriptions** Publishers can charge readers a monthly or annual fee for content or community access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>. Beehiiv does not take a cut of subscription revenue, only Stripe's 2% processing fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>. Many users generate over $100,000 annually through paid subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>.
2.  **Boost Network** (as detailed above) Passive revenue is generated when new subscribers opt-in to other recommended newsletters, with publishers earning $2-$4 per lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.
3.  **Direct Sponsorships** Publishers can create a public sponsorship storefront on their website, allowing advertisers to book ad placements directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>. Beehiiv integrates with an ad calendar, handles notifications, asset collection, invoicing, and payment processing for a flat $10 transaction fee, ensuring publishers keep the majority of their revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.
4.  **Beehiiv Ad Network** Beehiiv proactively provisions ads from major brands (e.g., Netflix, Nike, Roku, HubSpot) to publishers, based on best fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Publishers can choose ad copy, schedule placements with one click, and get paid per click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Building a Newsletter
Beyond financial goals, a newsletter can serve as a powerful tool for [[community_and_personal_development_via_newsletters | community and personal development via newsletters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.
*   **Thought Leadership and Community:** Tyler Denk uses his newsletter for thought leadership, publicizing his building journey, and fostering a community, leading to real-world connections and masterminds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
*   **Consistency is Key:** The greatest benefit often comes from consistent publishing, regardless of content length or perceived "top-notch" quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>. Regular communication builds trust, engagement, and a strong brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>.
*   **High ROI:** Writing weekly and sharing thoughts online has been described as the "highest leverage thing" for career growth, opening doors to angel investing, networking with founders, and inspiring others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
*   **Focus on Your Goal:** Not everyone needs to pursue high-growth [[marketing_strategies_for_newsletters | marketing strategies for newsletters]] and maximum [[monetization_through_newsletters | monetization through newsletters]]. Some may focus on building a business, while others prioritize enjoyment from writing and sharing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.

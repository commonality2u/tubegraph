Dan Chipper is actively incubating various AI startup ideas, several of which focus on transforming media and user interaction through artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A significant aspect of this innovation is the shift towards more interactive and voice-centric media experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Interactive Voice Notes and Media
One key idea involves "advanced voice notes" that go beyond simple recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Building on tools like ChatGPT's advanced voice mode, the concept allows users to chat back and forth with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This enables AI to help users think through complex issues, such as business or strategy problems, and reach conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The proposed enhancement allows users to send a summary of their AI-assisted thoughts to colleagues, who can then interact with the full transcript of the conversation to get deeper context and reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This effectively creates a voice note that can be talked to and conversed with, providing richer access to context and reducing the need for repetitive questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### AI-Powered Meeting Summaries and Podcasts
An internal incubation, called "tldr" (too long, didn't read), exemplifies this new media format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This tool processes meetings and converts them into brief podcasts, similar to a "notebook LM podcast," providing key takeaways in about three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This allows individuals, particularly those with busy schedules, to stay informed about missed meetings efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

A prototype of this concept allows users to interrupt a podcast and ask the host to clarify or expand on something, turning the passive listening experience into an interactive conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This desire for interaction with media is a "human nature" trait, suggesting hundreds of startup ideas could emerge from this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. A core principle is to consider how to transform any consumed media into a two-way interaction with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Storytelling and Media Formats
The current wave of AI technology significantly reduces the cost of storytelling, making it more accessible than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. While AI may not replace professional storytellers, it enables storytelling in contexts where it was previously too expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. For example, AI can summarize meetings, a task that would typically not warrant hiring a professional storyteller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This opens up a total addressable market in areas where stories can be told more affordably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Revitalizing Classic Literature
[[utilizing_ai_for_writing_and_content_creation | AI's capabilities]] also extend to creating new formats for existing media, such as classic literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Many "great books" like Marcus Aurelius or Plato are often difficult to read, but AI can translate them into engaging formats tailored for specific audiences or situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

For instance, AI can create versions of Plato's works that are engaging for someone in their 30s who is interested in tech, rather than solely focusing on historical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. This can involve making texts super easy to read, or even presenting them in multimodal ways, such as AI-generated Platonic dialogues in video format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. This could lead to a new "great books library" where out-of-copyright works are consumed in digestible audio and video formats, potentially with advanced voice mode interactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. This market could appeal to students seeking alternatives to traditional study aids like SparkNotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, as well as professionals interested in intellectual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

## The Rise of Voice-First Interfaces
Voice is emerging as a natural interface for the younger generation, particularly children aged three to twelve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. This trend is partly due to parents providing Apple Watches, which kids learn to maximize interaction with through voice commands to Siri, given the small screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. With advanced voice mode, even kids who cannot yet read can spend hours interacting with AI, asking questions and receiving responses without an adult tiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

This indicates a potential shift towards a new "oral culture" where interaction with computers and the environment will increasingly occur via voice rather than text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. For businesses, exploring voice-first interfaces is a significant area of opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. For example, a voice-first version of an online travel agency like Expedia could be a substantial venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

### Strategic Advantages for Startups
While large companies like Expedia could integrate voice at any time, history shows that new paradigms, like mobile-first companies, create massive opportunities for startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. These startups can build highly specialized user experiences tailored to the new interface, catering to early adopters without the risk of alienating existing users, as large companies might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. This allows startups to "figure out what the future of this is like" and gradually expand into the mass market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

## Monetization and Distribution Strategies
For AI-enhanced media, monetization can involve charging per download, play, or listen, which scales nicely with the value derived and the organization's size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This "per successfully completed task" model is a new trend in AI pricing, moving away from monthly subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

For "great books" in new formats, revenue could come from one-off access, subscriptions, or even beautifully crafted physical luxury versions with companion digital components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. This aligns with the idea that as technology makes things cheaper, some of those items become luxury status goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. Therefore, identifying what AI is making cheaper can reveal opportunities for luxury products that appeal to a smaller, affluent segment of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

For [[creating_ai_voice_character_apps_using_daily_bots | building AI apps]] and achieving user traction, a "distribution-first" approach is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. Building a media business or a strong audience, for example through a newsletter built over five years, allows for immediate access to hundreds or thousands of early users upon launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. Writing about topics of genuine interest attracts a like-minded audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. This approach leverages the current AI wave, which has reset the playing field, creating many "low-hanging fruit" opportunities for individuals to build products for themselves and their similar audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

For growing an audience today (in 2025), starting with YouTube and funneling subscribers into a newsletter is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. This allows for segmentation of the audience to send targeted invitations to the app, ensuring the acquisition of the "right users" who provide valuable insights and contribute to building a strong community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

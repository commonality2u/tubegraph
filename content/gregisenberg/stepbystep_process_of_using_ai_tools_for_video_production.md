This article outlines a step-by-step process for creating viral video content using AI tools, specifically Google's V3 for video generation and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for scripting and prompting. This methodology is shared by PJ, a creator known for his viral AI films on X. The goal is to provide a practical guide on how to monetize content creation with generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

The overall process involves ideation with AI, generating video clips, editing, and strategic social media posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>.

## Key Principles for Viral Content

Beyond technical execution, understanding why people engage with content is crucial in a world deluged by generative AI output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. The focus should be on creating entertaining content that people want to watch and share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

## Step 1: Ideation and Scripting with LLMs

The first step is to develop a "kernel of an idea" or a hook that makes the content unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

1.  **Initial Prompting**: Start by giving an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Grok) very generalized instructions. For example, "Give me four scripts for a standard pharmaceutical commercial for a fake medication that solves depression by taking a pill that's a play on words that includes 'pup' in the name and sounds like a real medication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
2.  **Iterative Refinement**:
    *   Allow the LLM to generate clich√© content initially, then "tear it apart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.
    *   Request specific styles, such as "SNL style satirical take" or jokes in the style of a specific comedian like [[integrating_various_ai_tools_for_video_creation | Seth Rogen]] or [[integrating_various_ai_tools_for_video_creation | Bill Burr]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a>.
    *   Continuously prompt for more lines and "zingers," refeeding your favorite lines back to the LLM so it learns and updates its output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>.
    *   Experiment with multiple LLMs; Grok's "unhinged mode" can generate unique, sometimes censored, material not found in other LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.
3.  **Script Finalization**: Select the best lines to form the body of the commercial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. Approximately 70% of the lines in PJ's viral "Puppine" commercial were generated by ChatGPT through this iterative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

## Step 2: Generating Video Shots with V3

Once the script is locked in, convert each dialogue line into a prompt for V3.

1.  **Prompt Generation**:
    *   Take each dialogue line from the script into ChatGPT or your chosen LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.
    *   Instruct the LLM to extrapolate a detailed prompt using a specific structure. For example, "Sarah says 'blank'... make Sarah a middle-aged woman in her 50s." Once the LLM learns the character descriptions, you can simply feed it the dialogue and it will apply the character details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>.
    *   Include descriptive elements in your prompts: pose, shot type, camera type (e.g., dolly in), background, and character emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:34:00">[22:34:00]</a>.
    *   To achieve character consistency (as V3 doesn't natively support it well yet), describe the character in detail the same way for each shot (e.g., "an old guy with short gray hair" or "a white guy in his 30s with a mustache and a beard and like strong chin with muscular arms") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>.
    *   Avoid including quotes in your prompts to prevent the generation of "weird gibberish subtitles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.
2.  **Video Generation in V3**:
    *   Use the "VO3" model for the highest quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>.
    *   Generate one output per prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>.
    *   Run prompts one at a time due to cost (approximately $2-3 per shot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.
    *   Be aware that V3 is a "slot machine" in terms of audio generation; sometimes there's no audio, or it's inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>. There is currently no effective image-to-video feature for character consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>.
    *   Expect a high ratio of bad generations to good ones (e.g., 5:1 in the "Puppine" commercial, where 30 clips were generated to get 10 good ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>.
    *   The "Puppine" commercial, which would cost hundreds of thousands to a million dollars to shoot traditionally, cost approximately $500 in V3 credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:00">[21:22:00]</a>.

## Step 3: Editing and Post-Production

1.  **Assembling Clips**: Stitch the generated video clips together. Tools like CapCut, Final Cut Pro, or the free DaVinci Resolve can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>.
2.  **Audio**: V3 generates audio for the dialogue within the clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>. Note that the audio quality can be "thin" (lacking deep EQ) and voice consistency is an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>.
3.  **Refinement**: Adjust pacing and flow. Copying the pacing of award-winning commercials can help new filmmakers level up their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>.

## Step 4: Crafting a "Hook" for Social Media

Creating a compelling hook (headline/caption) for your video is as important as the video itself, especially on platforms like X (Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a>.

*   **Provocative Statement**: Start with a statement that grabs attention. Examples include comparisons (e.g., "$500k pharmaceutical commercials vs. $500 V3 commercial") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a> or bold claims (e.g., "AI video quality just 10xed overnight") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a>.
*   **Cost/Effort Comparison**: Highlight the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of [[using_ai_tools_for_video_creation | AI video production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>.
*   **Trendjacking**: Incorporate trending topics or tools (e.g., "V3," "Cling 2.0") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:25:00">[27:25:00]</a>.
*   **Questions**: End with a question to encourage replies and boost algorithmic engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40:00">[27:40:00]</a>.
*   **Call to Value**: Offer something tangible, like "Steal my prompt below," to encourage clicks and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:49:00">[27:49:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Overused Language**: While certain phrases work, find your own unique way to express the impact of AI (e.g., instead of "Hollywood is cooked," try "what the [heck] did I just make") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>.

The entire process, from ideation to posting, can take as little as half a day (6-12 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31:00">[25:31:00]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies for AI Video Creators

There are numerous ways to monetize [[using_ai_tools_for_business_growth | using AI for content creation]]:

1.  **Build a Personal Brand**: Use V3 to create content that builds your brand and attracts an audience, which can lead to downstream work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>.
2.  **Attract Direct Clients**: Create specific types of commercials (e.g., food products, underwear brands) and pitch them directly to companies, agencies, or media buyers. Brands are interested in "unhinged special effects" that agencies can't produce within typical budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:15:00">[33:15:00]</a>. Charge at least $5,000 for content, valuing your filmmaking skills over just the AI credit cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:30:00">[33:30:00]</a>.
3.  **Build a Portfolio for Agencies**: Create a portfolio of diverse or niche commercial types (e.g., knife commercials) to attract agencies. You can "steal" (replicate, then tweak) the pacing and flow of award-winning commercials to quickly level up your skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>.
4.  **Create Narrative Series with Brand Integrations**: Develop an original narrative universe (e.g., Neural Viz's "moniverse") and integrate products naturally within the story. This allows for brand deals while maintaining creative control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:23:00">[36:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:00">[38:13:00]</a>. Find trending social formats and add your unique twist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:17:00">[39:17:00]</a>.
5.  **Sell Products (e.g., Courses, Digital Products)**: Offer courses, PDFs, or digital products to teach others how to use these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:35:00">[39:35:00]</a>.
6.  **Consulting for Companies**: Provide consulting services to Fortune 500 and other companies on how to integrate generative AI into their content creation within legal and compliance frameworks. Charge more for larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:08:00">[40:08:00]</a>.
7.  **Build a Sketch Comedy Channel**: Create sketch comedy shows, aiming for a large enough audience to attract brand integrations, similar to how brands use TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>.
8.  **Produce Narrative Films (Caution Advised)**: While possible (e.g., a 25-minute TV show), long-form content is less recommended due to the rapid iteration of AI tools, leading to potential inconsistency in quality from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:49:00">[41:49:00]</a>. Episodic weekly content is generally a better fit for the current creator economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:17:00">[42:17:00]</a>.
9.  **Pitch Brands on Narrative Content**: Offer to create episodic narrative series specifically for a brand, integrating their products as relics or artifacts within the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:02:00">[43:02:00]</a>.
10. **Target Small Sub-Niches**: Focus on underserved niches with high demand and low supply of content, such as Bible content (open-source IP with billions of daily active users) or "Romantasy" book talk, where creators can produce book promos or scenes from books for authors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:28:00">[43:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:40:00">[45:40:00]</a>.

The overarching advice is to pursue what fascinates you, copy successful frameworks, apply them to unique niches, and follow the technical instructions outlined in this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:19:00">[44:19:00]</a>.

Embeddable businesses involve owning "real estate" on other people's websites or applications, leveraging their existing traffic and credibility for marketing and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This concept is predicted to become "really big in 2025" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## How They Work
The core idea is to create a product or service that can be easily integrated into another website or app, often appearing as a small button, image, or footer text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This allows the embeddable business to gain consistent traffic and visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

## Examples
*   **Offer Button**: A button that can be embedded on any website, allowing users to make an offer to buy the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. It's free and has been embedded on over 400 websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Better Business Bureau**: Sells an image or badge that businesses can display on their websites to show legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Product Hunt**: Allows products featured on its platform to display "plaques" or badges on their websites, indicating recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Typeform**: A tool for creating forms and surveys that can be embedded into websites, appearing native with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Xero**: An invoicing software that includes "sent with Xero" branding at the bottom of invoices, which 99% of users don't pay to remove, providing automatic marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Beehiiv**: Similar to Xero, includes branding at the bottom of every email sent through their platform, serving as marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Gmail (early stages)**: In its invite-only phase (2004-2005), included "sent with Gmail" at the bottom of emails, helping it gain popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Superhuman / Super**: Email clients that display "sent with Superhuman" or "sent with Super" as a status symbol, indicating the user values aesthetic design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Benefits
*   **Consistent Traffic**: By existing on other sites, embeddable businesses continuously gain exposure from those sites' traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Automatic Marketing**: The embedded element itself often serves as a subtle, yet effective, marketing tool, leveraging the host's authority and user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This is known as lifting on the authority of the product's user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Low Margin**: Many embeddable businesses, like selling a badge or digital sticker, can operate with "99% margin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Credibility**: Products that offer acknowledgement or status, like "top product of the year" plaques, can significantly boost a brand's credibility and attract users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Considerations for Building
*   **Making Noise**: To gain traction, an embeddable product needs to "make noise" to attract eyeballs (supply) and then convert that into demand (sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This often involves building authority and driving traffic to the product's own page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Aesthetics vs. Functionality (MVP)**:
    *   While functionality (getting from A to B) is paramount for a product to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>, a good aesthetic can help grab attention, especially for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
    *   A well-designed landing page that clearly communicates the product's purpose is crucial for initial engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.
    *   Tools like Vercel and Framer AI can help create aesthetically pleasing landing pages quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.
*   **Impact on Conversion**: Offering an "influencer login" or similar feature might distract customers who aren't eligible, potentially lowering conversion rates for e-commerce brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. A more effective approach might be to proactively identify and offer benefits to influencers privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.
*   **Niche Down**: When building within an ecosystem like Shopify, it's beneficial to niche down further to solve specific pain points (e.g., CRO for construction workers, logistics for specific product types) to create a moat and avoid competition with larger players like Google or Shopify themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.

## The Shopify Ecosystem
The Shopify app ecosystem presents a significant opportunity for building embeddable products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. DTC (Direct-to-Consumer) businesses constantly seek solutions to save time, increase convenience, and improve conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>.

### Examples in Shopify
*   **Instant**: A page builder that sits on top of Shopify, offering SEO-optimized templates that use AI to generate native Shopify code, allowing for quick store launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>. This is an example of [[building_automated_businesses_with_ai | building automated businesses with AI]].
*   **Last-Mile Carrier Integration**: A Shopify app built for a fulfillment business that integrates last-mile carrier tracking links (e.g., USPS) directly into Shopify's fulfillment status, hiding the China origin from customers and enhancing the customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

### Finding Pain Points in Shopify
To identify pain points within the Shopify ecosystem, one must deeply understand the challenges faced by e-commerce businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>. This could involve hands-on experience, such as dealing with Chinese manufacturers (language barriers, distance, cultural differences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. Specific areas within DTC include:
*   Supply chain management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>
*   Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>
*   Email marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>
*   After-sales service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>
*   Store building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>

The constant flow of money in DTC makes it easier to justify a monthly subscription for a product that solves a significant problem, compared to more competitive SaaS niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>.

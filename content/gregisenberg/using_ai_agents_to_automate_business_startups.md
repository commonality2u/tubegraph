AI agents like "Operator" are demonstrating a new frontier in [[building_businesses_with_ai_technology | business automation]] and startup creation by performing complex, multi-step tasks across the internet. These agents can act as virtual employees, executing various functions that typically require significant human effort or dedicated software [00:00:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, [00:04:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>).

## Operator AI Agent

Operator is an AI agent that can be prompted to perform various business-related tasks online. While a $200/month "Pro Chat GPT plan" was mentioned, the core functionality demonstrated relies on the Operator agent [00:00:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, [00:00:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>). It logs into user accounts, navigates websites, inputs data, messages people, and logs information [00:01:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, [00:01:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, [00:03:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>).

## Potential Applications of AI Agents in Business

### 1. Retail Arbitrage

AI agents can automate the process of finding undervalued products on one marketplace and reselling them for profit on another [00:01:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, [00:03:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>).

*   **Process**: An AI agent can search platforms like Facebook Marketplace for specific items (e.g., Gozney pizza ovens) that are significantly undervalued compared to their market price on other platforms like eBay [00:01:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, [00:02:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, [00:03:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>). It can log promising finds into a spreadsheet with details, location, condition, and links [00:02:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, [00:05:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>).
*   **Automation Vision**: The ideal automated process involves the agent:
    *   Conducting eBay pricing research to determine average prices [00:10:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
    *   Making offers on Facebook Marketplace for a percentage of the market price (e.g., 50%) for items listed for extended periods [00:10:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, [00:10:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>).
    *   Once an offer is accepted, a human would take pictures and list the item on eBay [00:10:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
    *   Upon sale, the agent could potentially facilitate payment and provide shipping instructions for direct delivery from the original seller to the end buyer [00:10:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, [00:10:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>).
*   **Business Scale**: This arbitrage model could potentially [[building_businesses_with_ai_technology | build a six or seven-figure business]] by automating the search and negotiation for various high-ticket, undervalued products [00:03:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, [00:03:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>).

### 2. Gathering Quotes for Services

AI agents can automate the tedious process of collecting multiple quotes for services, saving significant time and potentially money [00:12:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, [00:13:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>).

*   **Process**: An agent can navigate websites like TheKnot.com, search for specific service providers (e.g., caterers in Dallas for a 50-person wedding), and fill out contact forms with specific requirements (e.g., "steak plus two sides") to request per-head quotes [00:12:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, [00:12:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, [00:14:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, [00:14:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>).
*   **Automation**: The agent can handle form submission, even choosing tentative dates when none are provided [00:16:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, [00:16:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>). It can adapt its behavior based on prompts, such as ceasing to ask for submission confirmation [00:18:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, [00:18:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>). It can even conduct targeted research, like finding "vegan caterers only in Dallas County" [00:19:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>, [00:19:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>).

### 3. Product Sourcing and Sample Acquisition

For businesses involved in product development or retail, AI agents can streamline the process of finding trending products and requesting samples from vendors [00:22:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, [00:22:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>).

*   **Process**: An agent can navigate e-commerce sites like AliExpress or Banggood, identify trending items, and message multiple vendors to request free samples [00:22:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, [00:22:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>, [00:25:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>). It can even handle account creation on these sites, generating strong passwords and verifying accounts [00:26:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>, [00:27:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>).
*   **Automation**: The agent can overcome obstacles, such as inaccessible websites, by finding comparable alternatives and navigating complex user interfaces [00:23:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, [00:23:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>). It learns to check necessary boxes (e.g., "check if you want the seller to respond") before submitting messages [00:26:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>, [00:31:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>).
*   **Future Vision**: It could be trained with specific trend data (e.g., Google Trend data) to search for products within those trends and acquire samples [00:33:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>, [00:33:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>).

### 4. Cold Email Outreach

AI agents can automate personalized cold email campaigns [00:33:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

*   **Process**: While direct scraping and cold outreach might be limited, if provided with a spreadsheet of emails, first names, and a message, the agent can log into a Gmail account within its browser and send customized cold emails [00:33:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>, [00:34:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>). This function alone could replace dedicated cold emailing software [00:34:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>).

## Capabilities and Limitations of AI Agents

*   **Learning and Adaptability**: Agents can "learn" by being shown how to perform a task (similar to Loom screen recordings) [00:15:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, [00:15:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>). They can remember preferences across tasks, such as not asking for submission confirmation [00:31:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>).
*   **Monitoring**: Users can monitor the agent's progress in real-time, providing more oversight than traditional virtual assistants [00:05:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, [00:05:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>).
*   **Current Limitations**:
    *   **Bugginess**: Results can be "hit and miss," and the agent may encounter unexpected issues or "stubborn points" where it refuses certain commands [00:06:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, [00:08:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, [00:21:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>).
    *   **Speed**: While it can be prompted to "move faster," there are limits to its execution speed (e.g., "unable to submit quote requests at that speed") [00:17:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, [00:20:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>).
    *   **Language and Tone**: The agent may be unable to switch languages or consistently adopt specific tones (e.g., "rude tone") [00:21:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>, [00:21:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>).
    *   **Site Accessibility**: Certain websites, like AliExpress, may be inaccessible for unknown reasons (potentially geographical or related to AI access restrictions) [00:22:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>, [00:23:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>).
    *   **Scaling**: While multiple instances might be run simultaneously with new accounts and VPNs, concerns about being timed out exist [00:08:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, [00:09:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, [00:17:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>).

## Business Implications

This technology represents an "arbitrage moment in business," allowing individuals to leverage global connectivity, vast data (like ChatGPT's knowledge base), and autonomous bots to [[utilizing_ai_in_startup_growth | automate tasks]] and [[creating_ai_employees_for_startups | create business value]] at a low cost ($200/month) [00:28:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>, [00:28:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>, [00:28:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>). It is seen as an early glimpse into [[successful_ai_applications_and_startups | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)]], with agents independently navigating the internet and solving problems [00:24:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>, [00:24:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>).

The technology is still early and buggy, but its potential is vast [00:08:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, [00:30:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>). Early adoption allows users to understand its nuances and limitations, positioning them advantageously as the technology improves [00:30:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>, [00:30:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>).

## Prompting Strategies

Effective prompting for AI agents involves:
*   **Blunt and Direct Commands**: Treating the AI like a machine, giving clear and concise commands [00:32:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>, [00:32:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>).
*   **Specific Goals**: Providing specific numerical or time-based goals (e.g., "submit three quote requests per minute") can help the agent understand and attempt to optimize its performance [00:20:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>, [00:20:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>).
*   **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously testing and making note of what works and what doesn't, iterating on prompts to achieve desired outcomes [00:32:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>, [00:32:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>).

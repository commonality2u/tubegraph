Next.js is a framework used for building websites with React <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. It allows developers to set up a server that runs React components and specify routes for their applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

## Deploying with Vercel

Next.js was created by Vercel, a company that provides tools for programming and a platform for hosting Next.js applications online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>. The framework is open-source and can be developed for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

Vercel makes the [[using_github_and_vercel_for_app_deployment | deployment]] process "super easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. An application can be made live on the internet by typing just one command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.

### Steps for Deployment

1.  **Install Vercel CLI**: Vercel provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. Documentation for installation is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.
2.  **Log In**: Before deploying, you need to log in to connect the CLI to your Vercel account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.
3.  **Deploy**: Once logged in, navigate to your project directory and type `vercel` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
    *   This command triggers a deployment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
    *   Deployments typically take around a minute and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
    *   Vercel provides a link where the application is deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. This URL can be accessed on any device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>, allowing users to share and test the live application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

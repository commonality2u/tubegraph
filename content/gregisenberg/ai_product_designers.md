AI product designers are tools designed to transform natural language descriptions into functional designs and code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These applications aim to simplify the design process, especially for non-designers, by leveraging artificial intelligence to generate interfaces and front-end code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Poly.ai

Poly.ai is an [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | AI product designer]] startup known for generating beautiful designs and production-ready code from English text inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The product aims to help non-designers create "production-ready designs and front-end code with AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Interface and Functionality
Poly.ai's interface resembles a chat application, similar to ChatGPT, where users can write their desired design specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. It supports voice input, allowing users to speak their design ideas, and also allows image uploads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Users can upload a hand-drawn wireframe or a screenshot of an existing interface to guide the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Credit System
Poly.ai operates on a credit-based system:
*   Free sign-up provides 250 credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   Generating a page costs 50 credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   Generating a component costs 25 credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### User Experience and Limitations
*   **Generation Time**: Generating designs can take several minutes, and the tool lacks a progress bar, making the waiting process uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Initial Output**: The first attempt to generate a "YouTube analytics prediction SaaS" resulted in a landing page rather than the actual product interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Buttons like "Get Started" or "See Demo" on the generated page were non-functional, leading to a black screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Prompt Specificity**: Achieving desired design aesthetics, such as "glass morphism," requires users to know specific design terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Without precise terms, the output may not align with expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   **Lack of Interaction**: Poly.ai does not offer interactive feedback or ask clarifying questions during the design process, making it feel like "shouting into a dark hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

### Improved Output (Second Attempt)
After a more specific prompt including the design term "glass morphism," Poly.ai generated a more detailed product interface, including sections like "AB testing," "AI prediction," "Recent Optimizations," and "AI Suggestions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. While the images within the product design were irrelevant to the use case (showing website analytics instead of YouTube data), the overall design was visually appealing and potentially more in-depth than competitor V0 in some aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

## V0

V0 is another prominent AI tool in the [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | AI product designer]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. It is frequently used for generating designs and code from prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### User Experience and Advantages
*   **Transparency**: V0 provides reasoning for its design choices, making the process feel more collaborative than Poly.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This transparency makes users "feel more at ease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.
*   **Interactive Feedback**: V0 can engage in a dialogue with the user. For instance, if asked about "glass morphism," it acknowledges if the design doesn't fully meet the criteria and offers to enhance it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.
*   **Output Quality**: V0 can generate interactive product designs where users can click around and simulate functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. Its visual design is considered slightly nicer than Poly.ai's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. However, it can sometimes "literally copy" an input image rather than interpreting it broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

## Comparison and Best Practices for [[Using AI tools for product design | AI Product Design]]

While both Poly.ai and V0 are capable [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | AI product designers]], they exhibit different strengths:
*   **Prompting**: Both tools benefit significantly from precise and detailed prompts, especially those including specific design terms like "glass morphism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **User Interaction**: V0 offers more transparent feedback and dialogue, which can guide users more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Poly.ai, in contrast, is more of a "black box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.
*   **Visual Design**: V0 is generally considered to have a slightly nicer visual output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.
*   **Functionality**: Poly.ai's second output offered a deeper dive into analytics dashboards, while V0's product was more interactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

For optimal results when [[using_ai_tools_for_product_design | using AI tools for product design]], it is recommended to:
*   **Know Design Terms**: Understanding design terminology helps in crafting more effective prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **Utilize Multiple Tools**: Just as users might combine ChatGPT and Claude for different writing or research tasks, combining multiple [[ai_tools_for_building_software | AI tools for building software]] or [[ai_tools_for_app_development | AI tools for app development]] can lead to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. Users can start with one tool like V0, then transfer its output or concepts to Poly.ai for further refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. This approach leverages the best features of each platform.
*   **Experiment**: Continuously playing with new products and understanding their nuances helps in determining which tools are best suited for specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

The rapid advancement of AI means that a tool that is superior today might be surpassed tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. The bar for AI product output is now very high, requiring "incredible" results for integration into daily workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

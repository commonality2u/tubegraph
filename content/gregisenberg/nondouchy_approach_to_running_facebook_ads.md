There is a significant gap in the market for non-agency companies or single-person consultants who help others run [[use_of_digital_marketing_strategies_like_seo_and_facebook_ads | Facebook Ads]] and simple Google search ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Many businesses, especially startups, struggle to set up even simple ads, making this a potential game-changer for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

## The Market Gap for Ad Services

While many businesses acknowledge the value of paid ads for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, the existing market for ad services presents several issues:
*   **Agencies** are often too expensive, large, and confusing for smaller businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Individual consultants** can be perceived as "douchy guys" who are intimidating or untrustworthy, especially those presenting a "get rich" lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   Many businesses have had negative experiences, leading them to believe that [[use_of_digital_marketing_strategies_like_seo_and_facebook_ads | Facebook Ads]] or Meta ads don't work, often due to encounters with unreliable or scammy providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

This creates a massive empty space for consultants who are "not douchy" and operate outside of the traditional agency model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Why Paid Ads Are Underutilized

There's a common misconception, particularly in "Ventureland" or among tech startups, that not running paid ads is a status symbol or something to be proud of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This perspective often stems from a focus on "cutting edge" Silicon Valley trends rather than practical business growth for small or traditional businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

However, paid ads are a powerful tool for [[strategies_for_aidriven_user_acquisition | user acquisition]] and lead generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. They can be particularly effective for audiences over 40, who are still highly active on Meta platforms, despite the perception that Meta ads are "dead" for younger demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

## The Nondouchy Consultant Model

The proposed "nondouchy" approach involves one-person ad consultants who:
*   **Appeal to specific verticals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Hair salons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
    *   Female product owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>
    *   Creative Patreon accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>
    *   Events like yoga retreats, creative retreats, wellness events, design events, or art installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>
*   **Avoid presenting themselves as "rich people"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This helps build trust and safety with clients.
*   **Focus on a revenue-share model** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Instead of a fixed monthly fee, the consultant takes a cut of every sale generated through their ads. This aligns incentives and provides a clear ROI for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Starting a Nondouchy Ad Business

To [[starting_a_servicebased_business_using_google_ads | start a service-based business using Google Ads]] and Facebook Ads with this approach, one could:
1.  **Identify events or businesses** in a familiar city or industry that are not yet full or struggling to attract customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
2.  **Contact them** and offer to fill their events or generate leads using paid ads, taking a percentage of the ticket sales or revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This is particularly appealing to event owners who enjoy putting on events but "hate selling" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
3.  **Start with advisory services**, guiding clients on setting up funnels and lead generation, rather than acting as a full agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Effective Ad Strategy: Building a Sales Funnel

A key element of successful paid ads is a well-structured sales funnel. The speaker's company runs a "$10 million funnel" that demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

### Funnel Components

A typical "Video Sales Letter" (VSL) funnel includes:
1.  **Opt-in Page:** The first page offered to interested individuals, requiring an email address in exchange for a free training video or lead magnet (e.g., a downloadable PDF, a list of exercises, or a physical book) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. The goal is to "sell" the idea of watching the video or receiving the free resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.
2.  **Video Training:** A free training video that provides value and demonstrates the consultant's expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.
3.  **Call Booking:** Instead of directly selling a product at the end of the video, the training offers a free call with a career coach or team member to discuss further training or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.

### Funnel Performance Example (June)

For one funnel in June, the company had:
*   **Total Ads Spent:** $86,000 (across Meta and Google/YouTube ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>
*   **Total Revenue:** $252,000 - $270,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>
*   **Return on Investment (ROI):** 38% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>
*   **Call Bookings:** 339 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>
*   **Turned Up to Calls:** 273 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>
*   **Units Sold:** 65 (of their "Workshop or Master" program) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>

This specific funnel has been running successfully since November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

### Tools for Funnel Building
*   **Framer:** Used for building aesthetically pleasing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.
*   **ClickFunnels:** Used for quick testing of Facebook ads and general funnel building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
*   **Calendly:** For booking calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.
*   **ConvertKit:** For email marketing campaigns, especially for pushing leads towards sales pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.

### Websites vs. Funnels
> A **website** is a business card, merely stating "here's all the stuff we do." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>
> A **funnel** is a step-by-step process designed to bring someone from being a stranger to a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.

## Conversion Rate Optimization and Copywriting

While ad spend and lead generation are important, [[optimizing_ad_return_and_profitability_with_ai | optimizing ad return and profitability with AI]] involves continuous tweaking of the entire funnel, not just the initial landing page conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. This includes sales calls, video content, and surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

### Copywriting Hacks
1.  **Status Increase:** Copy should subtly or directly imply that the product or service will increase the user's status among their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>. This means becoming more useful or valuable, leading to higher perceived status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.
2.  **Pain vs. Pleasure:** When writing copy, decide whether to focus on moving people *away from pain* or *towards pleasure* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.
    *   **Away from pain:** Highlights how the product solves a painful problem or prevents a negative situation (e.g., "never get stuck in the airport without your podcast equipment again") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. This is often more effective in bad economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.
    *   **Towards pleasure:** Focuses on the positive attributes and benefits of the product (e.g., how beautiful it is, how nice it sounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. This is often more effective during prosperous times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>.

While difficult, strong copywriting can make a massive difference in conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.

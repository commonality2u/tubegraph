[[Using AI tools for design | Utilizing AI tools]] for product design and development requires clear and specific prompting to achieve desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Tools like Poly.ai claim to be "AI product designers" that can generate beautiful designs and production-ready code from simple English commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, real-world application often reveals the necessity for more refined input.

## The Challenge of General Prompts

When first interacting with an [[utilizing_ai_tools_for_modern_product_design | AI product designer]], providing a general idea may not yield the best results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. For instance, a request to create a "glassy, minimalist, and with colorful calls to action" interface might result in a basic landing page rather than a functional product interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This highlights that AI, despite its capabilities, is only "as good as the prompt that you can do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## The Importance of Specific Design Terminology

To get the most out of [[using_ai_tools_for_design | AI design tools]], users need to understand and apply specific design terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Terms like "glass morphism" for a "glassy" aesthetic are crucial for guiding the AI towards a desired visual style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Without such precise vocabulary, the AI may struggle to interpret vague aesthetic preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

### Incorporating Visual Inspiration
[[Developing a user interface using AI tools | AI design tools]] can also be guided by visual inputs. Uploading a hand-drawn wireframe or a screenshot of an existing interface can provide a concrete starting point, often leading to outputs "closer to what you really want" compared to text-only prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. However, even with visual inspiration, the AI may still require explicit instructions on the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## [[Sequential prompting with AI tools | Iterative Prompting and Feedback]]

Achieving optimal design with AI often involves [[sequential_prompting_with_ai_tools | sequential prompting]] and iterative refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. This process includes:
*   **Initial Prompt**: Providing a general idea and aesthetic preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Refinement**: Analyzing the initial output and identifying areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Specific Instructions**: Re-prompting with precise design terms or asking the AI to focus on certain elements or functionalities (e.g., "Please do glass morphic") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   **Addressing Deficiencies**: Pointing out specific irrelevant elements or missing features (e.g., "irrelevant product images") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
*   **Pre-design Questions**: In an ideal AI product designer, it would ask clarifying questions to extract user taste and vibe before generating designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Comparing AI Tools: Poly.ai vs. V0

Different AI [[improving_ai_designs_and_interfaces | design tools]] handle prompt clarity and user feedback differently:

*   **Poly.ai**: Provides limited feedback during the generation process, acting somewhat like a "black box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Users "shout into a dark hole" and hope for the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. While it can produce a nice product eventually, it might require multiple prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. It offers features like saving design history and a rollback button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **V0**: Offers a more transparent process, showing its reasoning and "thinking" during generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. It provides direct feedback to user questions (e.g., "You're right, the current design has some glass-like elements but doesn't fully embrace true glass morphism") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This interactive feedback loop helps users understand how to refine their prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

While V0 is perceived as visually nicer and more user-friendly due to its feedback mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>, Poly.ai can sometimes produce more in-depth product interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

## Maximizing AI Design Tools through Combined Use

To truly achieve an "AI product designer at your service," a multi-tool approach is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. Just as users combine Chat GPT, Claude, or Grok for writing and research, combining different AI design tools can leverage their individual strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>. For example, a design from V0 could be input into Poly.ai for further enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. Understanding the nuances and optimal uses for each tool is key to [[leveraging_ai_for_startup_product_design_and_development | leveraging AI for startup product design and development]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

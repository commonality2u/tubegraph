When choosing an [[Current limitations and future potential of AI coding tools | AI coding tool]], two critical factors for many users are collaboration capabilities and deployment options. While no tool is yet at 100% for easily building production-ready applications, some are closer than others and offer distinct advantages in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:18">[07:10:18]</a>.

## Collaboration Features

Collaboration is a significant factor, especially when working with multiple individuals, such as technical co-founders, designers, or non-technical team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. The ability to work together seamlessly on a project is crucial for bringing ideas to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

*   **Tempo Labs** and **Replit** are highlighted as having excellent collaboration features, with Tempo Labs potentially holding an edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:01">[13:58:01]</a>. They are particularly beneficial for teams with varying technical skills, including designers and non-technical members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:01">[14:01:01]</a>.

## Deployment Capabilities

The ability to deploy an application, whether for preview or production, is a core function of an [[Building apps with AI tools | AI app building tool]].

*   **Lovable**, **Replit**, and **Bolt** offer excellent deployment experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:01">[14:20:01]</a>. These tools generally perform the job well, with no significant differences in their basic deployment functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:01">[14:26:01]</a>.
*   **Tempo Labs** currently only supports preview deployments, though the team is working on enabling production deployments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:01">[14:31:01]</a>.
*   [[Current limitations and future potential of AI coding tools | None of the tools currently allow for building something to production easily, simply, or without numerous roadblocks, headaches, or debugging efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:01">[07:41:01]</a>.
*   **Tempo Labs** and **Replit** are considered close to being production-ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:01">[07:15:01]</a>.
*   **Bolt** and **Lovable** are also moving towards production readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:01">[07:23:01]</a>.
*   **Cursor** and **Wind Surf** can be used to create production-level applications, but users should be prepared for significant pain, blocks, and debugging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:01">[07:26:01]</a>.

## Tool Classifications by Capability

Tools can be classified based on their code generation and deployment capabilities:
*   **Code Gen + Deploy (CD)**: Platforms that can generate code and also deploy it. This category includes **Lovable**, **Bolt**, **Replit**, and **v0** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:01">[11:40:01]</a>.
*   **Code Gen + Code Editor**: These tools generate code and also provide an integrated code editor. **Replit**, **Bolt**, **v0**, **Wind Surf**, and **Cursor** fall into this group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:01">[11:47:01]</a>.
*   **Code Gen + Code Editor + Figma**: **Tempo Labs** is unique in offering code generation, a code editor, and Figma-like capabilities for editing components and pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:01">[11:58:01]</a>. Its current limitation is that it only supports preview deployments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:01">[12:09:01]</a>.
*   **CD + Code Editor**: This combination is found in **Replit**, **Bolt**, and **v0** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:01">[12:16:01]</a>.

Choosing the right tool depends on the user's technical proficiency and desired level of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:01">[02:30:01]</a>. It is recommended to experiment with the free tiers of various tools to assess which best fits individual needs and project requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:01">[11:13:01]</a>.

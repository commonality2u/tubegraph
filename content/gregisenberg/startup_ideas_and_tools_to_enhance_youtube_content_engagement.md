This article explores the use of AI product design tools, specifically Poly.ai and Vercel's V0, in the context of developing a new startup idea aimed at enhancing YouTube content engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Poly.ai: An AI Product Designer

Poly.ai is introduced as an AI product designer from a YC startup that claims to generate beautiful, production-ready designs and code from simple English prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It's designed to help non-designers create professional designs and front-end code using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The interface functions similarly to ChatGPT, allowing users to type or record what they want to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. A key feature is the ability to upload an image, even a napkin wireframe, for the AI to base its design on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Poly.ai uses a credit system where generations cost credits (e.g., 50 credits per page, 25 per component), rather than direct dollar amounts, which is a common monetization strategy for AI companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Initial Impressions and Challenges with Poly.ai

When tested, Poly.ai took several minutes to generate a design, lacking a progress bar to indicate status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The initial output for a proposed YouTube analytics tool was a landing page, not the actual product interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. The generated landing page did not allow for clicking around to see the product in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. To achieve a specific "glassy" design aesthetic, the user had to use the precise design term "glass morphism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This highlights that users need to know specific design terms to get the most out of these AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

The product images generated by Poly.ai for the YouTube tool were initially irrelevant, resembling generic website analytics dashboards rather than YouTube-specific metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

## Startup Idea: YouTube Content Prediction SaaS

A "multi-million dollar a year startup idea" is proposed: an algorithm that predicts how well a YouTube video will perform based on its title and thumbnail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This idea is inspired by a viral tweet about an algorithm that simulates how thousands of users react to a tweet, predicting its virality before posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

The proposed YouTube tool would allow creators to test different titles and thumbnails to predict engagement metrics like comments, likes, and subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. While YouTube offers some A/B testing for thumbnails, a more in-depth product with deeper insights would be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This concept directly relates to [[youtube_growth_strategies | YouTube growth strategies]] and [[building_an_audience_on_youtube | building an audience on YouTube]]. This idea could become a valuable SaaS product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Designing the YouTube Prediction Tool with Poly.ai

The first prompt for Poly.ai was to create a "SaaS that does this," requesting a "glassy, minimalist, and with colorful calls to action" design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. After refinement and explicit instruction to create "glass morphism," Poly.ai produced a product interface called "Predict," which provided "AI powered analytics to optimize your YouTube content and maximize your engagement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The generated interface included features like "AB testing" and "engagement prediction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

The improved design included "Cumulative Engagement Chart," "Statistical Confidence," "Recent Optimizations," and "AI Suggestions," which were considered helpful and potentially more in-depth than V0's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. It also allowed hovering over charts to see exact numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. Crucially, Poly.ai also built out the code for the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

## Comparing Poly.ai with Vercel's V0

Vercel's V0 is presented as the most well-known product in the AI designer space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. When given the same prompt as Poly.ai for the YouTube prediction tool, V0 excelled in communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. It provided reasoning for its design choices and a clear understanding of the request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

V0's output was visually similar to the initial image inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, featuring "version A original content," "title," "description," and "thumbnail" fields, along with a "predict performance" button and AI recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. A key advantage of V0 is its interactive feedback mechanism; it can acknowledge if a design doesn't meet a specific aesthetic (like "glass morphic") and explain how it will enhance it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. This feedback loop makes V0 feel more like a conversational partner than Poly.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

## General Insights on AI Design Tools

*   **Prompt Engineering:** The quality of the output from [[ai_tools_for_idea_validation_and_content_creation | AI tools for idea validation and content creation]] is directly tied to the precision of the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Users need to understand design terms and trends ("taste") to effectively guide the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
*   **High Expectations:** The bar for AI product output is now very high; the results need to be "incredible" for users to integrate them into their workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
*   **Combined Tool Use:** To achieve the best results with AI product design, it's recommended to use a combination of tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. For example, a design from V0 could be refined further in Poly.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. This multi-tool approach applies to other AI categories like AI marketing as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.
*   **Nuance in AI Capabilities:** Different AI tools excel in different areas; for instance, some might be better at writing (e.g., Claude), while others are better for research (e.g., ChatGPT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

## Conclusion

While Poly.ai produced a functional and visually appealing design for the YouTube prediction tool, V0 provided a more interactive and reassuring user experience due to its conversational feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. Both tools are continuously evolving, and their capabilities may shift rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. For those looking to build a startup or enhance their content, experimenting with various [[ai_tools_for_idea_validation_and_content_creation | AI tools for idea validation and content creation]] is crucial to find what works best for specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. The proposed YouTube analytics and prediction SaaS product remains a strong [[monetizing_and_scaling_a_youtube_channel | monetizing and scaling a YouTube channel]] idea that could be built with these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

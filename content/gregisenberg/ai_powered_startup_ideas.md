In the current rapidly evolving [[AI startup ideas and market opportunities | AI world]], new opportunities are emerging for [[AI startup ideas and incubation | innovative startup ideas using AI technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Steph Smith outlines several [[AI opportunities and startup ideas | AI startup ideas and market opportunities]] that leverage artificial intelligence to solve existing problems or create new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

## Open Page Creator
The concept of "open pages," where individuals or startups publicly share their stats like revenue or user numbers, can be expanded and democratized using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Traditionally, building these pages was complex and selective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] The Idea
> Create a platform that allows anyone to easily build and customize "open pages" for virtually any aspect of their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This could include personal metrics like exercise frequency, supplement intake, or glucose monitor readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Users would control what data they choose to display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

### AI Advantage
Modern AI tools like Cursor enable individuals with no prior coding experience to whip up dynamic, customized pages in a matter of days or weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. This makes it significantly easier to create visual representations of personal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Real-World Application
> Steph Smith's husband, who had never coded before, used Cursor to create a detailed stats page for his surfing activities, tracking sessions, locations, and progress against goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

### Monetization
A free, simple page could be offered, with upcharges for additional modules and customization options, such as embedding Strava data or integrating affiliate links for products like supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. This provides a creative way for individuals to monetize their personal online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Related Idea: Knowledge Open Page
> Every personal webpage could feature a "knowledge open page" acting as a lead magnet, where users provide their email for access to popular guides or curated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. This helps creators own their audience's email addresses, essential given changing social media algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

## Integrated Health Platform
Individuals capture a vast amount of personal health data from various devices and services, but there is no centralized platform to integrate and make sense of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] The Idea
> Develop a centralized platform that integrates data from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), fitness trackers (e.g., Strava), blood test results (e.g., Function Health), medication logs, and doctor's visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.

### AI Advantage
An AI layer or a ChatGPT-like interface would triangulate this integrated data, offering suggestions and insights into potential health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>. This "digital doctor" could answer complex health queries by integrating personal data with real-time web information, surpassing the capabilities of a traditional doctor in real-time data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Personal Use Case
> Steph Smith's experience with inexplicable nausea after a marathon, potentially linked to a new medication, highlights the need for such a tool to identify correlations across different health data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>.

### Monetization
Users would likely pay substantially more than a standard $10/month subscription, given the cost of existing health devices (e.g., Oura Ring, Eight Sleep) and the actionable insights this platform would provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>. A potential price point of $30/month or more is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>. This could also be offered as a perk by businesses to employees, incentivizing healthier lifestyles similar to U.K. health insurance models that reward healthy behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Micro-Fix Health Assistant
> This platform could also serve as an ongoing AI health assistant, helping users build habits for things like drinking more water or improving posture, providing personalized reminders and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>.

## Custom GPT Directories
Existing online directories, which aggregate information, can be significantly enhanced through custom GPTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] The Idea
> Transform static directory websites into interactive, personalized GPTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>. For example, Nomad List (a directory for digital nomads) could become a custom GPT where users chat about their specific preferences (e.g., weather, budget, visa requirements) to get tailored city recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:00">[22:54:00]</a>.

### AI Advantage
Custom GPTs offer a conversational interface that allows for highly personalized recommendations based on user input, which is a significant improvement over filtering options on traditional directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:00">[22:54:00]</a>.

### Monetization
Monetization for custom GPTs is still nascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24:00">[23:24:00]</a>. However, a lawyer using top legal GPTs for lead generation demonstrates a potential model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a>. The key is to offer specialized data or unique effectiveness that cannot be replicated by general AI models like ChatGPT or Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>. This could work for many topics through ads, affiliates, products, or as a lead generation mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>.

## AI-Powered Dating Apps
Current dating apps predominantly rely on physical appearance and swiping, failing to effectively match people based on deeper compatibility traits like humor and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] The Idea
> Develop a new generation of dating apps that leverage AI to match users based on personality, humor, and shared interests, moving beyond just looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:44:00">[25:44:00]</a>.

### AI Advantage
AI can analyze user preferences and behaviors to determine compatibility through indirect means, such as swiping on memes to gauge humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:00">[26:00:00]</a>. The future of dating apps could entirely remove the swiping mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>. Users could connect their apps like Goodreads, Netflix, or Strava (or even their open pages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30:00">[27:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:00">[27:44:00]</a>. The AI would then assign blind dates with prompts for conversation starters based on shared interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>. This essentially creates a "personalized AI matchmaker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a> that manages all dating mechanics, including time and location setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:00">[28:11:00]</a>.

> [!SUMMARY]
> These ideas highlight how the "crazy new AI world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a> is not just about building new tools, but also about reinventing existing concepts through the power of AI. The focus is on leveraging AI for personalization, data integration, and automating complex tasks, offering unique [[startup ideas using AI technology | AI startup ideas and frameworks]] that differentiate from conventional approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.

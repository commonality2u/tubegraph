The landscape of [[monetizing_ai_applications_and_new_media_formats | AI applications]] and [[opportunities_in_specific_ai_apps_and_micro_apps | micro apps]] presents significant opportunities for financial gain, even for those starting with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The focus for some founders is on achieving personal financial stability, such as retiring parents or buying a first house, rather than immediately "changing the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This foundational capital, referred to as "your first nut," provides a base for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Case Study: The Riz App Phenomenon

An illustrative example of successful [[monetizing_ai_applications_and_new_media_formats | AI app monetization]] is the "Riz" app, an [[integrating_ai_features_into_mobile_apps | AI dating coach]] built on top of Chat GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This application was reported to be making $190,000 per month with 333,000 downloads per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The founder's initial idea for the app came from a Tinder subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Business Model and Strategy
The strategy behind such apps often involves creating a "Chat GPT wrapper" focused on a specific niche, such as companionship and dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The success of these applications, even if they don't involve complex proprietary technology, heavily relies on marketing and branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Key elements for [[strategies_for_promoting_and_distributing_ai_apps | promoting and distributing AI apps]] include:
*   **Strong Brand Name:** A memorable and culturally relevant name, like "Riz" (a term for charisma or attractiveness among youth), can significantly boost virality and user engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Referral Flows:** Integrating features that encourage users to invite friends can lead to organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Niche Focus:** Instead of trying to be an app for everyone, specializing in specific verticals (e.g., dating coaching, style, life advice) allows for targeted positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### A Developer's Success Story
A 23-year-old co-founder of a three-person development studio, operating under the company name AI RZ, built several successful applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. These include:
*   **Plug AI (Riz app competitor):** A texting assistant that uses AI to generate pickup lines from text message screenshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Astra:** An AI-powered life advice app offering guidance on challenges, relationships, personal growth, and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Palette:** An app that uses [[using_apis_in_ai_app_development | state-of-the-art AI]] to determine a user's color season from a selfie, generating personalized style and makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

This studio reached $500,000 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. While Apple takes a third of the revenue, an estimated profit margin of 65% or more suggests substantial income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. These apps leverage existing technology without building extensive new infrastructure, focusing instead on interesting brands and strong positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Sustainability and Risks
While profitable, businesses built on top of external AI models like GPT face risks, such as OpenAI drastically increasing their API charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. However, even if an app is a "flash in the pan," the financial gains and the business skills acquired—such as marketing and managing operations—are transferable to future ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

For instance, a company making $350,000 in profit per month could accumulate $4 million in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. From an investment perspective, focusing on a profit share rather than equity might be appealing for businesses aiming for immediate profitability over a massive IPO or exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

## Anti-Trends and New Opportunities
When considering [[monetizing_custom_gpt_applications | custom GPT applications]], it's beneficial to explore "non-obvious" use cases, as many developers are already pursuing the more apparent ones (e.g., dating, therapy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

Furthermore, every trend often spawns an "anti-trend," which can lead to unique startup ideas with less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. For example, alongside the rise of AI-powered coaching, there's a growing demand for human-centered services, for which a premium can often be charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. An AI app could even offer a premium upgrade to human intervention, serving as an entry point to higher-priced services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This approach highlights an opportunity to leverage AI for customer acquisition, then transition to human-delivered services for increased [[pricing_strategies_for_ai_products | pricing strategies for AI products]] and deeper engagement.

## Networking and Business Growth
Direct and empathetic communication can be a powerful tool for networking and making deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Offering a direct phone number and being flexible with availability can establish stronger connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Moving conversations to text messaging can also make interactions feel more personal and facilitate ongoing communication, fostering deeper relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This approach can be particularly effective for closing corporate deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

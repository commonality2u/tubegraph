[[ai_tools_for_small_businesses | AI tools]], specifically Vercel's VZ, are transforming web design and development by acting as an AI assistant for tasks like UI creation, backend structuring, and learning design principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. VZ's focus is on working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and modern frameworks, aiming to produce high-quality web products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Vercel's VZ: An AI Assistant for Web Development

VZ serves as an [[ai_tools_for_small_businesses | AI assistant]] specifically for web development, focusing on the web, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and new frameworks and libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. The goal of VZ is to simplify the process of generating high-quality web designs and ultimately, high-quality products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

### [[using_ai_tools_for_design | Using AI Tools for Design]]

VZ offers two main creative modes for design:
1.  **Opinion-driven**: Users start with a clear idea or screenshot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
2.  **AI-driven**: Users provide a general concept and let the AI generate initial designs, then iterate from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

Examples of [[utilizing_ai_tools_for_modern_product_design | utilizing AI tools for modern product design]] include:

*   **Music Player UI**: Starting with a screenshot, users can refine the design through iterative prompts. This includes requests for specific color tones ("warmer Grays"), fonts (e.g., Sanda from Google Fonts with Next.js), layout adjustments ("tighter information density," "less vertical spacing between the rows"), and element modifications (e.g., "time playing bar should be longer," "search input should have an actual input") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
*   **Specific Design Directives**: Users can explicitly mention Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., "make it size four") to guide VZ, as it "thinks in Tailwind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Uploading images allows VZ to incorporate them into designs, significantly enhancing visual quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness**: VZ can be prompted to make designs mobile responsive, and further refined to fix layout issues (e.g., "I can't see the table of songs because the image is so large") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **SaaS Landing Page**: VZ can generate various sections of a website, such as a SaaS landing page, with prompts for minimal design, specific backgrounds, and animated elements like a terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. It can also create dashboard views and admin portals, providing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>.

### [[developing_a_user_interface_using_ai_tools | Developing a user interface using AI tools]]

Vzer is built on top of Shad CN UI, which allows for the creation of component libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. The code generated by VZ is designed to be production-ready React components, allowing developers to take the output and integrate it directly into their projects without needing to re-architect later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>.

### [[comparison_of_ai_coding_tools | Comparison of AI Coding Tools]]: Backend Development with VZ

VZ is not limited to UI design; it can also assist with backend development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. After designing the UI, users can ask VZ to implement functionality by swapping mock data with API calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>. VZ can:
*   Fetch data from external APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a>.
*   Understand database schemas (e.g., PostgreSQL) and generate Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) code for frameworks like Drizzle or Prisma in JavaScript/TypeScript, or equivalent code for other languages like Rails or Laravel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>.
*   Help design database structures, even suggesting performance optimizations like using indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>.

### Learning Web Design with AI Tools

While prior knowledge in web design helps, it's not a requirement to use VZ effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. [[ai_tools_for_startup_creation | AI assistants]] can help users learn by suggesting questions to ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. For example, a user can prompt: "I'm a novice at web design... what can I try to make things look a little better? Any common practices or patterns?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. VZ can then provide advice on:
*   Consistent color schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.
*   White space, padding, and margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.
*   Readable fonts (e.g., sans-serif vs. serif) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.
*   High-quality images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

Users can also ask follow-up questions to understand concepts like "what is a sans-serif font and what are the differences?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>.

For inspiration, external resources like godly.website (for design inspiration, filtering by startups) and patterns.co (for UI patterns) can be used, with screenshots from these sites serving as starting points for VZ prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.

### The Future of Building Products with AI

AI tools are augmenting the development process rather than replacing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23:00">[27:23:00]</a>. They act like a "knowledgeable super senior engineer" providing best practices and accelerating product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28:00">[27:28:00]</a>. With tools like VZ and other AI assistants, developers have the power to build almost anything they can imagine, from web applications to iOS and Android apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:45:00">[27:45:00]</a>.

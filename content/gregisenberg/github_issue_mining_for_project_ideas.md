[[Brainstorming startup ideas | Brainstorming startup ideas]] for new projects, particularly [[idea_generation_for_chrome_extensions | Chrome extensions]], can be effectively done by "mining" GitHub issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This method involves looking for unresolved problems within open-source projects.

## What is GitHub Issue Mining?
GitHub is a platform where developers collaborate on projects, and issues are used to track bugs, feature requests, and other problems that need to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Many non-developers may not be aware that they can browse these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

By observing repetitive unresolved problems, individuals can identify significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## How to Utilize GitHub for Ideas
1.  **Browse Issues:** Navigate through different projects on GitHub and review their reported issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  **Identify Unresolved Problems:** Look for problems that are frequently reported or have remained unresolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
3.  **Spot Repetitive Themes:** If a similar problem appears across multiple issues or projects, it signals a common pain point that could be a viable business opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Benefits and Applications
*   **Minimal Viable Product (MVP):** A Chrome extension can serve as an excellent MVP for solving a specific problem identified through issue mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Scalability to SaaS:** An MVP Chrome extension can later evolve into a full-fledged Software as a Service (SaaS) business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Developer Market:** The developer market is substantial and often willing to pay for tools that solve their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Companies like Superbase have raised significant funding by addressing developer pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Lean Teams:** Building developer tools, including Chrome extensions, often doesn't require large teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Examples
*   **VidIQ:** This tool started as a Chrome extension for YouTube creators before expanding into a comprehensive SaaS business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **TanStack Query (formerly TanStack Query):** This library addressed a major data fetching issue in React development, becoming so effective that React's official documentation recommends its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This demonstrates how solving a critical developer problem can lead to widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

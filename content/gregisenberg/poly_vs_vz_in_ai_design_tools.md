The landscape of [[using_ai_tools_for_design | AI design tools]] is rapidly evolving, with new products emerging that promise to revolutionize how designs and front-end code are created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This article explores two prominent platforms, Poly and VZ, examining their capabilities, user experience, and the quality of their design output for [[developing_a_user_interface_using_ai_tools | developing a user interface using AI tools]].

## Poly: An AI Product Designer Startup

Poly is an AI product designer startup that claims to generate beautiful designs and production-ready code from simple English prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It's pitched as an "AI product designer at your service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Initial Impressions and First Design Attempt
Upon first use, Poly's interface resembles ChatGPT but for design, allowing users to type or speak their design ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. A notable feature is the ability to upload an image, even a hand-drawn wireframe on a napkin, for Poly to reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

For a test, the platform was tasked with creating a SaaS product for YouTube analytics, inspired by an existing viral tweet concept for X (formerly Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The idea was to create a tool where YouTubers could predict how changes to titles, thumbnails, and other elements would affect engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The prompt requested a "glassy, minimalist, and with colorful calls to action" design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

The generation process for Poly can take a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. A significant drawback noted during this waiting period was the absence of a progress bar, leaving the user unsure of how long the process would take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

The first output from Poly was a landing page titled "To Predict," with the slogan "AI powered analytics to optimize your YouTube content and maximize your engagement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. However, the design did not appear "glassy" as requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Crucially, clicking on "analytics" or "get started" on the generated page led to a blank screen, meaning the actual product interface was not built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This initial result was disappointing, as the expectation was to see how the product would work, not just a static landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### Second Design Attempt: Prompt Refinement and Design Terminology
To address the lack of the requested "glassy" aesthetic, the user discovered the correct design term: "glass morphism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This highlighted a key lesson for [[designing_with_ai_prompt_clarity | designing with AI prompt clarity]]:
> [!NOTE] The effectiveness of many [[utilizing_ai_tools_for_modern_product_design | AI design tools]] is directly tied to the clarity and specificity of the prompt, often requiring knowledge of technical design terms to achieve desired aesthetic outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

In a second prompt, Poly was specifically asked to incorporate "glass morphism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. While the resulting design was "a little more glossy," it still didn't fully embody the desired aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. The output also included an image that was "not useful" as it depicted general website analytics charts rather than specific YouTube-related data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

### Third Design Attempt and Poly's Strengths
A third attempt involved re-emphasizing the need for relevant product images and expressing disappointment with the previous, irrelevant dashboard-like visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
This time, Poly generated a more functional-looking product interface for the "To Predict" tool. Key features included:
*   Version A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>
*   Options for image, video format, and emoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>
*   A cumulative engagement chart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>
*   Statistical confidence metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>
*   Recent optimizations and AI suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>
*   Title optimizer and performance comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>

The interface was visually appealing ("beautiful") and more in-depth than expected, with interactive elements like hover-over charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. Poly also generates the underlying code, which is a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. However, it still struggled with contextualizing elements like "video format" for a YouTube-specific tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

## VZ: A Well-Known AI Designer

VZ is described as "probably the most well-known product in the [[utilizing_ai_tools_for_modern_product_design | AI designer space]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The user had prior experience with VZ for similar design tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### User Experience and Output
When given the same prompt as Poly—to design a YouTube engagement predictor with a "glassy, minimalist interface" and "colorful calls to action"—VZ offered a more transparent user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. It provided reasoning for its actions, stating it would create a SaaS application that helps YouTubers predict content performance based on the image shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. This transparency made the user feel more "at ease" compared to Poly's "black box" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

VZ's generation time felt faster due to the visible progress and detailed feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. The generated design was "amazingly similar" to the inspiration image provided, even "literally copied" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. It successfully built a product interface with features like "version A," "original content," "title," "description," "thumbnail," and predictive performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

One significant advantage of VZ was its ability to engage in a dialogue about the design. When asked if the design was "glass morphic," VZ responded by acknowledging that while it had glass-like elements, it would "enhance it to create distinctive frosted glass aesthetic with more pronounced blur Effects light borders and depth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This feedback loop and ability to refine designs through conversation is a strong point for [[improving_ai_designs_and_interfaces | improving AI designs and interfaces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

## Comparison and Conclusion

### Key Differences and Similarities
*   **Visual Appeal:** VZ generally produced a "nicer" visual output, while Poly's initial designs were less appealing but improved with more specific prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.
*   **Speed & Transparency:** VZ felt faster and more user-friendly due to its transparent generation process and detailed feedback. Poly, despite potentially similar actual generation times, felt slower due to its "black box" nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   **Interactivity & Feedback:** VZ excels in providing conversational feedback and allowing for iterative refinement, making it more interactive. Poly is more of a "shouting into a dark hole" experience, where users have to hope the output aligns with their intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **Output Depth:** Poly, in its final attempt, generated a more in-depth product interface with detailed charts and metrics, including hover-over functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. VZ, while functional, literally copied the image provided.
*   **Code Generation:** Both tools are capable of generating production-ready code, a significant advantage for designers and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

### Choosing the Right Tool and Multi-Tool Integration
The comparison between Poly and VZ highlights that while both are powerful [[comparison_of_ai_coding_tools | AI coding tools]], neither is a perfect "AI product designer" on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Users often need to know specific design terms like "glass morphism" to get the most out of these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

> [!TIP] The reality is that [[integrating_various_ai_tools | integrating various AI tools]] is often the best approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. Just as one might use ChatGPT, Claude, and Groq for different writing or research tasks, multiple AI design tools can be combined to achieve optimal results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.

While VZ might offer a slightly better visual design and more conversational feedback, Poly's ability to generate more in-depth charts and code is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. By using VZ to refine a design and then potentially transferring it to Poly for detailed feature generation or code extraction, users can leverage the strengths of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. This approach exemplifies [[choosing_the_right_ai_tool_based_on_technical_proficiency | choosing the right AI tool based on technical proficiency]] and the specific task at hand.

The conclusion is clear: [[using_ai_tools_for_design | AI product designers]] are here, but they require user guidance and often a combination of tools to achieve sophisticated, production-ready designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. The bar for AI product output is now very high, demanding "incredible" results for integration into daily workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

AI avatars allow users to create incredible, personalized content, often in a Disney or Pixar-style format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These AI-generated images and videos can drive significant revenue for businesses, particularly in marketing, which is fundamentally about storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. By leveraging AI tools like Leonardo AI and Cling AI, and understanding how to use prompts effectively, individuals and startups can generate cash flow and create innovative products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Power of AI Avatars
AI avatars are digital characters or images created using artificial intelligence. The process often starts by providing an image reference, such as a photo of a child or person, and basic details like name, age, and gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. AI tools can then generate a detailed prompt description of this character, including hairstyle, skin tone, and outfit, ensuring character consistency across different images or story parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

### Creating Consistent Characters
Maintaining a consistent character across a series of images or a narrative is crucial for storytelling. By generating a base prompt from an initial image, the same character can be depicted in various scenes and situations while retaining their core visual attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. For example, a character like "Greg" can be consistently shown exploring new ideas or interacting with magical objects, creating a cohesive visual story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Tools for AI Avatar Generation
Key tools in the creation of [[AI avatars and sequential prompting | AI avatars]] include:
*   **ChatGPT**: Used to generate detailed textual prompts from an initial image and user-defined characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. It can analyze an uploaded image and describe elements like hairstyle and clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.
*   **Leonardo AI**: This tool takes the generated prompt from ChatGPT to create high-resolution images of the AI avatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. It offers free tokens for generation and can be connected via API for programmatic image creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
*   **Cling AI**: Converts static images created in Leonardo AI into animated videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. It also features a dubbing capability that allows characters to lip-sync words, further [[enhancing_media_with_ai_and_voice_interaction | enhancing media with AI and voice interaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

## Understanding Sequential Prompting
Sequential prompting is a technique where ChatGPT generates a prompt that is then used as an input for a different AI tool to create an output. This output, in turn, can be used as input for yet another tool, creating a chain of AI interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.

### ChatGPT as a Prompt Generator
Instead of directly generating the final image or video, ChatGPT is used to refine or create the specific prompt text needed for other specialized AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>. This allows for more precise control over the output of subsequent tools like Leonardo AI. Initially, this process is best done manually for rapid iteration and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>. Once the desired output is consistent, the workflow can be automated via APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.

### Multi-Tool Workflow
The sequential prompting workflow connects various AI tools:
1.  **ChatGPT (Input: Image + Request)**: Analyzes an uploaded image and generates a detailed character description prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. It can also generate prompts for specific scenes, interactions between characters, or to add text overlays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
2.  **Leonardo AI (Input: Prompt from ChatGPT)**: Creates high-quality images based on ChatGPT's detailed prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
3.  **Cling AI (Input: Image from Leonardo AI)**: Animates the static images, turning them into short video clips or GIFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. This step also enables [[enhancing_media_with_ai_and_voice_interaction | voice interaction]] and lip-syncing for characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
4.  **Remove.bg (Input: Image from Leonardo AI)**: Removes backgrounds from the generated images to create clean, transparent assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
5.  **Printful API (Input: Image from Remove.bg)**: Integrates with e-commerce platforms like Shopify to automatically print and ship physical products, such as stickers or t-shirts, featuring the AI-generated designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
This process can be automated using tools like Zapier or Make for simpler integrations, or by bringing on an engineer for more complex custom API connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:48">[01:28:48]</a>.

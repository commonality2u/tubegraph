[[introduction_to_boltnew_and_its_benefits_over_cursor_ai | Boltnew]] is a new AI tool that has been described as a "[[comparing_boltnew_with_other_ai_development_tools_like_cursor_and_v0 | Cursor]] killer" and a "[[comparing_boltnew_with_other_ai_development_tools_like_cursor_and_v0 | V0]] killer" due to its ease of use, even for non-technical individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It claims to allow users to [[building_prototypes_with_boltnew_for_nontechnical_users | create a prototype]] in 20 minutes or less, making it potentially easier than [[comparing_boltnew_with_other_ai_development_tools_like_cursor_and_v0 | Cursor AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Boltnew is seen as a culmination of various tools placed into one platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Building a Text-to-Image Application with Boltnew

A practical demonstration involved [[live_demonstration_of_building_with_bolt | building a text-to-image application]] using Boltnew, integrating with Foul.ai as the image generation API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Foul.ai is an aggregator of AI image models that provides simple APIs for interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

#### Initial Setup
The process began by prompting Boltnew to build a simple landing page for a SaaS project using Next.js 14 best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Unlike [[comparing_boltnew_with_other_ai_development_tools_like_cursor_and_v0 | V0]], which defaults to Next.js, Boltnew requires the user to specify the framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Boltnew handled the initial project setup, including building layouts, pages, and installing necessary packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

#### Integrating Foul.ai
To integrate Foul.ai, the user prompted Boltnew with "I want to build a text to image AI application, I'm going to use Foul.ai, what should I do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Foul.ai's documentation requires installing a client, setting up an API key, and handling the image generation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Boltnew then guided the user to configure the API key in the `.env.local` file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

#### Demonstration of Image Generation
After setting up the API key, the application was able to generate images from text prompts, such as "two dudes on a podcast virtually talking about AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> and "futuristic city with Chick-fil-A" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The generated images, while not always perfect, demonstrated the core functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

#### Deployment and Challenges
[[deployment_and_realtime_features_with_bolt | Boltnew offers one-click deployment]] through a partnership with Netlify, a reliable deployment platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. However, the deployment process frequently encountered errors, particularly related to missing modules or unneeded files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. The workflow for troubleshooting involved copying error messages from the terminal and prompting Boltnew to "fix this error" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

While Boltnew is designed to install external packages, the deployment can be "finicky" when external packages are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. The tool is noted for being "a little slow" due to everything being online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, which is attributed to its early stage and potentially a high volume of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Despite these bugs, the ability to generate a working prototype in under 20 minutes was highlighted as a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. The speaker believes that the Boltnew team will address these issues, as similar tools like [[comparing_boltnew_with_other_ai_development_tools_like_cursor_and_v0 | V0]] and [[comparing_boltnew_with_other_ai_development_tools_like_cursor_and_v0 | Cursor]] also had initial bugs that were later resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### User Perspective on AI Tools
For non-technical individuals, Boltnew and Replit are considered "clear winners" because they handle the end-to-end development process, including deployment, which is often a major hurdle with tools like [[comparing_boltnew_with_other_ai_development_tools_like_cursor_and_v0 | Cursor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. For those who enjoy programming and want more control, [[comparing_boltnew_with_other_ai_development_tools_like_cursor_and_v0 | Cursor]] is preferred as it allows coding while providing AI assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. [[building_prototypes_with_boltnew_for_nontechnical_users | Boltnew]] is useful for quick prototyping and visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

The overall [[tips_and_guidance_for_beginners_exploring_ai_tools_like_boltnew | advice for beginners]] is to keep playing with these tools, iterating, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Staying updated and exploring new tools is important, even if they are not immediately used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. The speaker emphasized that with a "couple prompts," it was possible to build a functional text-to-image application without writing any code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.

Starting an email-based business, such as a newsletter, is often recommended for individuals aiming to earn between $10,000 and $20,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Platforms like Beehive simplify the process, enabling creators to scale from zero to 100,000 subscribers and begin [[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | monetizing]] at revenue levels of $10,000, $15,000, $20,000, or $30,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Tyler Denk, co-founder of Beehive and a former team member at Morning Brew (which reached 3.5 million subscribers and a $75 million acquisition), shares insights on building and growing an email newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Advantages of Starting a Newsletter

The co-host emphasizes that everyone should consider starting an email newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Tyler Denk, through his own newsletter "Big Desk Energy," grew from zero to 90,000 subscribers in approximately 14 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. A newsletter with 90,000 subscribers, even as a side project requiring about five hours per week, can generate between $20,000 and $30,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Setting Up Your Newsletter with Beehive

Beehive offers an all-in-one solution for newsletter creation, eliminating the need for multiple platforms for your website, automations, and newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Website Builder and Customization
Beehive includes a full website builder that allows for fully customizable websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Users can create different pages, such as a subscribe page and an archive page for stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. When a newsletter is published, it simultaneously becomes a web version and an email newsletter, which is SEO optimized and hosted in the same location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This integrated approach also tracks subscriber and visitor data, including UTM parameters and link clicks, for better audience analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Email Capture Features
To maximize email acquisition, Beehive offers features like:
*   **Pop-ups**: Customizable pop-ups can be dropped on specific pages and tailored based on traffic source (e.g., Facebook or X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. These "Death By A Thousand Cuts" strategies can increase conversion rates from 10% to 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Gated Content**: Content can be gated, meaning visitors must subscribe to read the full post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. This acts as a continuous [[growth_strategies_for_increasing_newsletter_subscribers | lead magnet]], converting interested readers into subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.

### Custom Signup Flows
Newsletters can create custom signup flows, which dictate where subscribers go after entering their email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. These flows can include:
*   **Recommendation Model**: Interstitial steps can recommend other newsletters, potentially leading to passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Surveys**: A crucial step for collecting demographic and interest data about new subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Tyler's survey receives a 30% conversion rate from sign-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. This data helps tailor content and secure sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   **Thank You Page**: A final destination introducing the newsletter and its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Automations (Welcome Series)
Automations allow for automated email journeys. A welcome series is essential for:
*   **Building Trust**: Introducing the newsletter and humanizing the creator, for instance, by sharing a personal Spotify playlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Engagement**: Asking new subscribers to take actions like following playlists or referring others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Collecting Data**: Sending follow-up emails to encourage completion of surveys, especially if skipped initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Increasing LTV (Lifetime Value)**: An opportunity to offer courses, products, or one-on-one time, turning subscribers into customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### [[Growth strategies for newsletter audiences | Newsletter Growth Strategies]]

#### Recommendation Networks
Beehive provides a recommendation network where publishers can organically recommend other newsletters within the Beehive ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. Publishers can gain hundreds of free, high-quality subscribers per week through this passive, network-effect-driven growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. This compounds over time, similar to "time in market beats timing the market" in investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.

#### Boost Network (Paid Acquisition)
The Boost network is a two-sided marketplace within Beehive for paid subscriber acquisition and monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Publishers can earn money by promoting other newsletters on their signup flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. If a new subscriber opts into a recommended newsletter, the original publisher earns a fee (e.g., $2-$4 per lead) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.
*   **Growth**: Publishers can pay other newsletters to promote their content. Payments are only made for engaged subscribers who open and engage with emails, making it a "risk-free" [[growth_strategies_for_increasing_newsletter_subscribers | growth strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. Features like "auto-pause" automatically cut off underperforming channels based on open rate thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. This creates a "vending machine" effect: investing $2.50 to acquire a subscriber that generates $4 in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>.

#### [[Launching and scaling a subscription business | Lead Magnets]]
Lead magnets are digital assets offered in exchange for an email address, providing value related to the main content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.
*   **Implementation**: Create custom landing pages for lead magnets using Beehive's website builder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. Drive traffic from social media (X, LinkedIn) to these pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. Set up custom signup flows and automations to deliver the lead magnet (e.g., a PDF download) directly via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Value**: Lead magnets attract a highly relevant audience. For example, offering a seed deck used for fundraising attracts founders and investors, who are ideal subscribers for a business-focused newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. They can also be monetized by seeking sponsorships from companies whose Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) aligns with the lead magnet's audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

#### Referral Programs
Referral programs incentivize existing subscribers to share the newsletter, turning "super fans into a growth channel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>.
*   **Setup**: Beehive offers a native referral program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. Publishers set rewards (e.g., a digital product like a PDF or a discount code for merch) at specific milestones (e.g., one referral) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. Automated emails deliver rewards, minimizing manual fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
*   **Best Practices**: Keep rewards simple and focus on low-effort milestones (like one referral) to teach the behavior and encourage initial sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. Integrating the referral section directly into the newsletter allows readers to easily track their progress and share their unique link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.

## [[Monetization strategies for newsletters | Newsletter Monetization Strategies]]

Beehive provides several ways to [[how_to_monetize_newsletters_effectively | monetize newsletters effectively]], ensuring that revenue supports growth and operations.

### Paid Subscriptions
Newsletters can charge readers a monthly or annual fee (e.g., $5, $10, $20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. Beehive does not take a cut of subscription revenue, only the standard 2% Stripe fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>. Many users generate over $100,000 per year from paid subscriptions, and some are pushing for a million dollars in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>. Paid tiers can also offer access to exclusive communities (Slack, Discord) through automations and APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>.

### Boost Network (Passive Revenue)
As mentioned in [[Growth strategies for increasing newsletter subscribers | growth strategies]], the Boost network allows publishers to earn passive revenue by recommending other newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>. When new subscribers opt into these recommendations, the original publisher gets paid per lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.

### Direct Sponsorships/Ad Sales
Publishers can sell direct advertisements through a customizable sponsorship storefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>. This storefront displays newsletter statistics for advertisers and allows them to book ad placements directly on the publisher's ad calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>. Beehive charges a flat $10 transaction fee for bookings, with the publisher retaining the full sponsorship revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>. This system automates notifications, asset collection, and reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.

### Beehive Ad Network
Beehive also operates an ad network that provisions ads from major brands (e.g., Netflix, Nike, Roku, HubSpot) to publishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Publishers can choose ad copy, select publication dates, and integrate ads into their newsletters with one click, receiving payment directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.

### Affiliate Marketing
Newsletters can leverage affiliate programs, such as Beehive's own highly competitive partner program that offers a 50% commission for driving new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>. This can be integrated into referral programs, offering exclusive discounts (e.g., 40% off Beehive) as rewards for referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>.

## Consistency and Mindset
The primary goal for starting a newsletter varies: some aim for high growth and revenue, others for community building, thought leadership, or a creative outlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. Consistent publishing is highlighted as one of the most impactful actions for career growth and opening new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>. It helps build trust, engagement, and a personal brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>. Overcoming the fear of "not delivering top-notch content" every time, similar to Seth Godin's daily blog, is crucial for maintaining consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.

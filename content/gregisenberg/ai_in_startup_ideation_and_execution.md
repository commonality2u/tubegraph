From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

The current landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) sees [[AI startup ideas | AI agents]] beginning to replace tasks traditionally performed by teams of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Most founders, however, are building in the wrong direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The real opportunity lies not in creating better AI, but in [[Building a successful AI startup | building businesses around AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The necessary tools and market demand are already present, but the connections aren't being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This article explores three specific business ideas, each leveraging [[AI driven business ideas and startups | AI agents]] to solve real problems and potentially be worth millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. These ideas are described as "obvious" once heard, which is precisely why they are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Solopreneurs and Automation

Arvid, an Indie Hacker and solopreneur, focuses his [[Creating startup ideas using AI | ideas]] on tasks that human beings should ideally be doing but can now be performed by technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. He has always been a proponent of machine learning and AI, even before the widespread accessibility of GPT and LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. His approach is to identify human skill-based tasks that can be reliably and sufficiently handled by a machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. AI is seen as a powerful accelerator for all aspects of business, from [[AI startup ideation and framework | ideation and organization]] to implementation and operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. The core philosophy is that "laziest people are the wealthiest people" because they automate tasks, leading to better economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

## Business Idea 1: AI Co-founder

The most comprehensive idea is an **AI co-founder**: a virtual, always-on, 24/7 co-founder that requires zero equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. As a solo founder, one must wear many hats, and this AI could handle tasks like marketing, sales, business development, and financial analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

Currently, many founders awkwardly use tools like ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude for brainstorming or generating content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. An AI co-founder would streamline this by constantly thinking about and, in future versions, executing on assigned tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

### Capabilities and Functionality

An ideal AI co-founder would:
*   **Handle Marketing**: Be smart, adopt the founder's voice and tone, and intelligently research target audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **Personalized Outreach**: Constantly scrape the web and scour data sources (e.g., Apollo) to build internal representations of individuals, then craft optimal communication strategies for sales or marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
*   **Act as a Virtual Assistant/Executive Assistant**: Operate with varying degrees of independence, from providing tools for conversation to having conversations directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **Offer Multiple AI Roles**: A scalable business could offer specialized AI agents for marketing, CTO roles, or sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. These virtual persons would possess deep skills in their respective fields, learn about the business, and continuously generate new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Training**: Users would train their AI agents on their specific codebases, documents, knowledge bases, and internal thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
*   **AI-on-AI Interaction**: In a more advanced stage, different AI agents (e.g., a CTO AI from one company and another from a different company) could interact virtually, exchanging ideas and insights that could benefit their respective businesses, akin to AI mastermind groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. This represents an "agentic approach" to problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

### Addressing Concerns
Some might argue that an AI cannot replicate the emotional element of a human co-founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. However, the purpose of an AI co-founder is not emotional attachment but execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Current LLMs are described as "gaslighting engines" that confidently assert answers, apologize when corrected, and learn from feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. This dynamic of convincing and adapting can be applied professionally.

Models could be trained to align with the founder's personality, perhaps by selecting templates (e.g., Peter Thiel or Elon Musk styles) or by scraping their online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. Such AI agents might even foster stronger bonds than human co-founders due to the absence of social tension or anxiety, particularly during stressful periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. An AI co-founder would relentlessly pursue solutions until the very last second, unlike a human who might seek alternative employment when runway is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

While not replacing human creativity, an AI co-founder could be a crucial "crutch" during the initial months of a business, providing access to a vast knowledge base and quick decision-making capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>. A founder would readily pay $50-$100 per month for an agent that delivers a positive ROI, constantly performing outreach or research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. Podscan, Arvid's podcast scanning app, is an example of such an agent, providing real-time competitor mentions to allow for timely engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.

### Development and Monetization
While the idea is strong, building such a broad product for all types of founders could be overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. A better approach would be to **niche down**, focusing on specific types of founders (e.g., YC SAS founders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. Training specific models for niches is expensive, but using existing broad models (like GPT-4o) with custom system prompts can provide an initial solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>. Bootstrapping could involve streamlining how founders already clumsily use AI by unifying information from various sources (e.g., embedding documents and conversations for retrieval) into one accessible place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. This iterative approach allows for validation and development based on user needs, unlike a funded approach that might skip these stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>.

## Business Idea 2: Silent Constant Refactoring as a Service ("CodeCouldBeBetter.com")

This idea involves an AI service that constantly checks and improves a codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. The service would connect to a code repository and perform:
*   **Error Checking**: Linting, syntax error analysis, and logic error detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>.
*   **Fixing Suggestions**: Like Sentry's beta feature, it would suggest fixes and even create pull requests for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>.
*   **Code Improvement**: Continuously identify modules that could be better, make changes, simulate the app's performance with those changes, and run unit and integration tests in a virtualized environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:00">[23:39:00]</a>. It would iterate, discard ineffective changes, and implement new varieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>.
*   **Performance Optimization**: After days of continuous optimization loops, it would present tangibly more performant code without human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>.
*   **Future Planning**: Connect to the product roadmap to anticipate future features and proactively improve the database, data schema, codebase, documentation, and models to facilitate future implementations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>.

This service acts as an "autonomous developer" constantly striving for improvement, delivering fully developed, tested, and commented code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>. The suggested domain name for this service is "CodeCouldBeBetter.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:00">[26:24:00]</a>.

### Market Opportunity and Pricing
This idea could compete with or be an acquisition target for large companies like Sentry, a multi-billion dollar company that already offers similar beta features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>. Building an AI-based business now provides an opportunity to get noticed by larger companies who are slower to adopt cutting-edge AI due to existing product maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:00]</a>.

Pricing models could include:
*   **Per-Connected Repository**: Charging based on the number of repositories connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:32:00">[31:32:00]</a>.
*   **Cost-Plus**: Calculate the computational cost (GPU usage for AI, spinning up instances for testing) and add a margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>. The service would ideally shift testing and staging costs to the customer, focusing its own expense on the AI-accelerated tasks like prompting and embedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:27]</a>.
*   **Cadence-Based**: Charge based on how often experiments are run (e.g., once a day for $20-$100 in expense, leading to $600-$1000/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:16:00">[33:16:00]</a>.
*   **ROI-Based**: Anchor the price to the value it provides, potentially replacing multiple full-time developers (e.g., three 8-hour shifts a day could replace over $200,000 in annual developer fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>. If the tool can perform wilder experiments, like changing infrastructure (e.g., from RabbitMQ to AWS Kafka), it could save millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:07:00">[35:07:00]</a>.
*   **Tiered Pricing**: Start with basic features like static analysis and error tracking for $50-$100 a month, then increase prices as more advanced, computationally expensive, and potentially risky capabilities are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>.

## Business Idea 3: Niche Data Aggregation and Summarization

The problem addressed is the "gatekeeping" by social media algorithms, which dictate what users see rather than what they want to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>. This creates a need for trusted aggregators that provide relevant, unfiltered information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:41:00">[37:41:00]</a>.

The idea is to build a service that uses AI to **aggregate and summarize information for specific niches**, tailoring the delivery format to individual subscriber preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:52:00">[39:52:00]</a>.

### Examples and Functionality
*   **Podscan as a Precedent**: Some Podscan users already use it to aggregate and summarize information for specific sub-industries, like the medical world, for doctors who lack time to consume all relevant content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04:00">[38:04:00]</a>.
*   **Data Sources**: Collect data from real-time data streams, APIs, news sites, social media influencers, newsletters, and even OCR scanned magazines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[39:16:00]</a>. An example given is the "horse world" for horse farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:36:00">[39:36:00]</a>.
*   **Personalized Summarization**: Summarize content to the exact detail level a subscriber prefers:
    *   Dense, bullet-point overviews with links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a>.
    *   Several paragraphs per interesting item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>.
    *   Long-form (e.g., 2,000-word) emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:17:00">[40:17:00]</a>.
*   **Diverse Delivery Mediums**: Deliver information in preferred formats:
    *   Fake podcast conversations between AI experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:32:00">[40:32:00]</a>.
    *   Short, "James Clear-style" newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:00">[41:11:00]</a>.
    *   AI-generated news-style podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:18:00">[41:18:00]</a>.
    *   Automated AI-generated videos with screen grabs from articles or social media posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:26:00">[41:26:00]</a>.

The core process involves taking vast amounts of data, aggregating it, summarizing it, and shaping it into easily consumable content for an audience thirsty for results without the effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:43:00">[41:43:00]</a>.

### Building and Monetization
This idea is considered relatively straightforward to implement, especially for a solopreneur aiming for $10,000 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:13:00">[42:13:00]</a>. The key is picking the right niche and reliably curating content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:32:00">[42:32:00]</a>. This can be monetized by offering a free tier for 99% of content and a paid tier (e.g., $9/month) for premium access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:40:00">[42:40:00]</a>.

The "magic" of this idea lies in knowing the audience and how to communicate with them, which is why it works best for individuals who are already dabblers or experts in their chosen niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:08:00">[44:08:00]</a>. Being part of the target niche helps with understanding the language, prompting AI effectively, and building in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:00">[44:51:00]</a>.

This business serves as a "wedge" that can evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:18:00">[45:18:00]</a>. For example, a horse-focused publication could naturally lead to building SaaS solutions for the horse community, addressing logistical problems (e.g., coordinating vets, medicine, transportation) that are invisible to outsiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:31:00">[45:31:00]</a>. An AI agent could even monitor news for common problems in the niche and suggest solutions or ideas for new businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:05:00">[46:05:00]</a>. This concept creates a valuable transmission between abundant data and people with specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:36:00">[46:36:00]</a>.

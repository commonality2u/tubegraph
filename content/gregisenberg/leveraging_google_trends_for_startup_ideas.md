It allows entrepreneurs to gauge public interest and explore related concepts to build sustainable businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Why Use Google Trends?

In the competitive startup landscape, many ventures chase popular trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. However, focusing on [[antitrends_in_startups | anti-trends]] can offer a unique competitive advantage, as there might be less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Google Trends helps validate the demand for these less-explored niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## How to Leverage Google Trends

### 1. Basic Search and Trend Analysis
Begin by searching for a potential trend or anti-trend term, such as "slow living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The tool displays search interest over time, with a five-year view being particularly useful to observe long-term patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. For instance, "slow living" shows progressive, sustainable growth worldwide, indicating a steady opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### 2. Exploring Related Queries and Questions
Google Trends offers "what people also search" and, more importantly, "questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. These questions, like "What is slow living?" or "How to practice slow living?", provide direct insight into the audience's mindset and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This information is critical for identifying potential products or services that resonate with the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### 3. Enhancing with Glimpse Chrome Extension

### 4. Geographical Insights
Google Trends also shows where search interest is highest geographically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

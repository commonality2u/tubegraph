Leveraging owned media and adapting to platform shifts are critical for modern B2B growth, allowing businesses and founders to create products, sell services, and generate inbound leads without geographic constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The younger generation is reportedly "printing money on YouTube" and using it to subsidize productized services and SaaS companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This represents a new business model that is changing how the industry functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Key Strategies for B2B Growth

### 1. Leverage Emerging Platforms and Trends
Businesses should identify larger trends to attach themselves to, rather than trying to educate the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The goal is to sell what people already want to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

#### LinkedIn Video Strategy for Founders
LinkedIn is rolling out a "For You page" feed, similar to TikTok, creating a "blue ocean" opportunity for video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. An agency could service founders by:
*   Interviewing them weekly to generate ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   Creating scripts based on conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   Guiding founders on recording videos for quick content creation (e.g., 10 minutes to record many clips) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   Editing and scheduling clips for LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

This service allows founders to build a massive personal brand and generate inbound leads through free reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Pricing could range from $2,500 a month for content creation to $5,000-$8,000 a month for additional services like lead magnet creation and design help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
To acquire clients, an agency could:
*   Grow its own LinkedIn channel by demonstrating the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   Build a free community (e.g., "Founders Going Viral on LinkedIn.com") offering tips and breakdowns of successful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   Upsell community members to the full service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

This approach capitalizes on the trend of founders building personal brands through "VC subsidies" (their companies' marketing budgets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

#### [[marketing_strategies_for_b2b_companies | Marketing Strategies for B2B Companies]] with Owned Media
The power of owned media, like a YouTube channel or podcast, is that it provides "rails" to publish any content, allowing for rapid zero-to-one company creation that is sustainable and cash-flow positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. This strategy enables individuals to build a platform and cross-promote across all social channels, gaining owned distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### 2. Capitalize on AI Automation Demand
The search volume for "AI automation" is experiencing explosive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. Businesses are seeking solutions for automating tasks using tools like Make.com, Zapier, and ChatGPT APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Opportunity:** Offer consulting or productized services for SMBs to implement AI automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Pricing:** A productized service with an embedded AI automation engineer could charge around $8,000 per month, justified by instant cost savings from automating "paper pushing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.
*   **Distribution:** Bid on "AI automation" and related keywords (Zapier, Make.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Create tutorials using AI tools (e.g., Perplexity AI) with calls to action for consulting services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. A YouTube channel could supplement this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

People want automation for cost savings, making it an easy sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

### 3. Develop AI-Powered Creative Tools
There's a gap in the market for an AI graphic designer that can generate brand-consistent visual assets (e.g., podcast thumbnails, email headers) from a brand style guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.
*   **Desired Functionality:** Users would input a title, text, and perhaps a background image, and the AI would generate variations (e.g., 20 Facebook ads) based on the brand's style guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition:** The tool doesn't need to be perfect, just "good enough" (80% of a graphic designer) and "a hundred times faster" than traditional requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
*   **Business Model:** A SaaS solution, potentially priced at $99/month, undercutting existing services like Design Pickle ($499/month) by leveraging AI for lower costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>. The ability to multi-thread prompts (generate multiple assets simultaneously) would be a key differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
*   **Application of AI:** By applying constraints (like brand style guides) to AI, the outputs become more accurate and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

### 4. Offer Done-for-You Newsletter Services for Founders
Many founders want a newsletter but lack the time or desire to write it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   **Service Model:** Interview founders for an hour weekly, then use the transcript to generate newsletter content (e.g., using AI to maintain tone and voice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.
*   [[newsletter_growth_strategies_and_lead_generation | Newsletter growth strategies and lead generation]]:
    *   **Audience Acquisition:** Scrape emails from existing Twitter followers or LinkedIn connections using tools like SalesQL, validate them, and sequence them into the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.
    *   **Automated Growth:** Implement automations (e.g., via Phantom Buster) to send automated DMs to new social media followers with a newsletter subscribe link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition:** Founders see this as a high return on investment (ROAS - Return on Audience Spend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. It mitigates dependence on single platforms by building an owned email list, acting as "schmuck insurance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.
*   **Target Audience:** Founders with existing social media followings who need operational support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.

### 5. Data-Driven [[youtube_growth_strategies | YouTube growth strategies]] and Monetization
YouTube is dominating the creator space due to built-in monetization and high RPMs (revenue per mille) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.
*   **Opportunity:** Create a subscription-based library of YouTube thumbnails and titles, allowing creators to plug-and-play assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>.
*   **Key Feature:** Integrate data (impressions, views) for each title/thumbnail combination, potentially leveraging YouTube data or tools like VidIQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
*   **Go-to-Market:** Cold email YouTubers (e.g., those with >10,000 subscribers in specific categories) with a free offer to access a limited number of templates, then upsell to a paid tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
*   **Benefit:** Helps creators combat "ad fatigue" by constantly cycling through fresh, data-validated thumbnail and title combinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>.
*   **Monetization Example:** A YouTube channel with 263,000 views and 6,300 new subscribers in 28 days generated an estimated revenue of $3,000, which subsidizes the cost of building that audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>. The ability to attract an audience interested in specific topics allows creators to sell products and services directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.
*   **Targeting VC Firms:** This concept can be extended to VC firms, who increasingly want to be "media companies" to attract deal flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. An agency could offer to create and manage their content (videos, thumbnails, titles), selling the service as a value-add to their portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>.

### 6. Niche Accounting Software (QuickBooks for X)
Identify underserved niches within large software categories like accounting.
*   **Idea:** Create specialized accounting software or services, like "QuickBooks for D-to-C E-commerce" (e.g., Finaloop.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.
*   **Market Research:** Analyze QuickBooks extensions or prompt AI to identify categories where businesses seek integrations, then assess market size and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Example Niches:** SaaS, agencies, real estate, nonprofits, Airbnb entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Focus on non-internet businesses where competition might be lower, as internet businesses often have saturated markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

### 7. Resurrecting Niche Travel Newsletters
Revive the concept of "cheap flights" newsletters by leveraging Google Flights' alert capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.
*   **Model:**
    *   Target frequent travelers on platforms like Facebook Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>.
    *   Direct them to a newsletter that aggregates cheap flight alerts from Google Flights for various major metros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.
    *   Monetize via subscription and affiliate programs (e.g., Kiwi.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>.
*   **Growth:** The nature of good deals encourages organic sharing among friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.
*   **Scalability:** Start with one city, then expand to all major metros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **Extension:** Create additional newsletters based on location (e.g., "What's Happening in My City") to increase stickiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.
*   **Rebranding:** Capitalize on the lack of "soul" in former services like "Scott's Cheap Flights" (now Going.com) by choosing evocative domain names (e.g., YULdeals.com for Montreal airport) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.

### 8. Canva App for Video Captions
Develop a third-party app for Canva that automatically transcribes and captions videos, leveraging large whisper models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity:** Canva is a rapidly growing video editor, but its native captioning features are lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>.
*   **Features:** Transcription, integration with Canva's font styles, and variations like karaoke-style captions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.
*   **Business Model:** A subscription app, potentially achieving $20K/month or more by leveraging Canva's massive user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.
*   **Exit Strategy:** Build traction to attract an acquisition from Canva itself, who may want to integrate such functionality natively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.

## Overarching Principles for Growth

### Consistency in Content Creation
[[frameworks_for_effective_writing_and_content_strategy | Content creation]] is a grind, but the challenge is consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. Founders should identify a sustainable content rhythm (weekly, monthly, daily) and then delegate operations to a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. Think of yourself as an editor or conductor rather than a writer, focusing on bringing in a pipeline of ideas and using a system to create content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

### Building an Audience and Trust
A large audience, especially on platforms like YouTube, provides deep trust in a one-to-many format, generating inbound leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>. It allows creators to gain leverage and operate independently of traditional geographic or pedigree constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>. The key is attracting the "right followers"—those with high buying power or specific interests, rather than just large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.

### Un-Gatekeeping Knowledge
Similar to how the internet democratized medical knowledge, sharing expertise publicly, especially in underserved or "unsexy" niches, can attract an interested followership and build reputation and leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>. This acts as a sales tool, creating inbound interest for companies and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>.

### Embracing Authenticity
Being authentic and discussing topics of genuine interest, even if perceived as "too niche," can lead to significant success because it resonates with a specific, dedicated audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a>. It’s also less exhausting than trying to adopt a persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

### Creating Digital Gravity
Building "digital gravity" means accumulating as much digital mass (content, presence) on the internet as possible to increase serendipity and attract opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. Being everywhere creates a stronger pull.

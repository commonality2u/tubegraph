While [[introduction_to_bolt_and_its_capabilities | Bolt]] is a powerful new tool, especially for [[using_bolt_for_rapid_prototyping_and_deployment | rapid prototyping]] and non-technical users, it is still in its early stages and users may encounter several challenges and bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Common Issues

*   **Slowness** Being an online-based tool, [[introduction_to_bolt_and_its_capabilities | Bolt]] can be slower than expected, especially during package downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This slowness is also attributed to a high volume of users trying the new platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Bugs and Breaking Code** The application can occasionally "bug out" or "break," leading to errors and unexpected behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   **Deployment Failures** Deploying applications, particularly when using external packages, can be "finicky" and prone to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.
*   **Unused Files and Dependencies** [[introduction_to_bolt_and_its_capabilities | Bolt]] may install unnecessary files and dependencies, which can lead to build errors during deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

## Troubleshooting Strategies

Despite these challenges, a consistent workflow can help manage issues:

*   **Resend Prompts** If [[introduction_to_bolt_and_its_capabilities | Bolt]] "bugs out," simply resending the prompt can sometimes resolve the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Copy and Paste Errors** When an error occurs, copy the exact error message from the terminal or console and paste it into the [[introduction_to_bolt_and_its_capabilities | Bolt]] prompt, asking it to "fix this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. This often allows the AI to self-correct.
*   **Provide External Documentation** If the AI struggles to resolve an issue, providing relevant documentation or code snippets from external sources (e.g., API documentation) can guide it toward a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   **Request Removal of Unused Elements** If the system attempts to use files or modules not needed for the project, prompt [[introduction_to_bolt_and_its_capabilities | Bolt]] to "please remove it and remove any other files or folders I'm not using" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **Patience and Persistence** Since [[introduction_to_bolt_and_its_capabilities | Bolt]] is a new tool, it is expected to have bugs. Users are encouraged to keep playing with the tool and persist through errors, as the development team is actively working on fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.
*   **Manual Intervention (Developer Experience)** While [[introduction_to_bolt_and_its_capabilities | Bolt]] aims for automation, developers familiar with the code can sometimes manually fix issues when the AI struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Tools

In its initial stages, [[introduction_to_bolt_and_comparison_with_cursor_ai | Bolt]] has been observed to be slower and buggier compared to [[introduction_to_bolt_and_comparison_with_cursor_ai | Cursor AI]] after it received significant funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. However, this is expected for a newly launched platform.

## Future Outlook

The current issues are likely temporary, and with potential funding and server scaling, [[introduction_to_bolt_and_its_capabilities | Bolt]] is expected to overcome its performance and bug challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. The ability for non-technical users to build a working prototype in under 20 minutes, even with some bugs, highlights its significant potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

Starting an email-based business, such as a newsletter, is a recommended approach for individuals aiming to reach $10,000 to $20,000 per month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Platforms like Beehiiv streamline the process of growing from zero to 100,000 subscribers and achieving monthly earnings of $10,000 to $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Tyler Denk, co-founder of Beehiiv and formerly instrumental in Morning Brew's growth to 3.5 million subscribers, shares his expertise on building and monetizing an email newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. He emphasizes that a successful newsletter business is built through a compounding of various strategies rather than a single "silver bullet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## Beehiiv as an All-in-One Platform

Beehiiv offers an integrated solution for managing a newsletter, eliminating the need for multiple platforms for websites, automations, and newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Website Builder
Beehiiv includes a full website builder that allows for customizable web pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This means a newsletter can also be a web article, fully published and SEO-optimized in the same location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Data Tracking and Analytics
The platform tracks where subscribers and visitors originate (e.g., X, LinkedIn) using UTM parameters, and monitors their on-site behavior, including link clicks within emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This data helps publishers and entrepreneurs understand their audience better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Email Capture Features
Beehiiv provides features for capturing emails, such as customizable pop-ups that can be configured for specific pages or traffic sources (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Custom Signup Flows and Automations
Users can create custom signup flows to direct new subscribers to different pages after email submission, such as a recommendation model, a survey, or a thank-you page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Different subscribe forms and pop-ups can lead to different signup flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

[[building_simple_and_effective_marketing_workflows | Automation flows]] can also be synced to each signup form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. These automated journeys can range from a simple welcome email to a 15-step series with logic and parameter updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

#### Importance of Welcome Series
A welcome series builds instant trust and humanizes the newsletter's creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. It's an opportune moment to encourage actions like following a playlist or referring others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. It also provides an opportunity to increase Lifetime Value (LTV) by introducing courses, SaaS products, or one-on-one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Audience Surveying
Surveys at the point of subscription are crucial for gathering demographic data (e.g., age, gender, primary role, skill set) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This data helps dictate [[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | monetization strategies]] and content creation, ensuring it resonates with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. For example, knowing 60% of readers are founders led one newsletter to focus on founder-startup content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. Beehiiv's native survey builder allows for various question types, and follow-up emails can be sent to encourage survey completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

### Referral Programs
Built-in referral programs incentivize existing subscribers to share the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. Rewards can be digital goods (e.g., PDFs, exclusive content) that cost nothing to produce or physical goods with fulfillment handled by third-party services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. A simple "one referral" milestone with a valuable digital reward can be highly effective in teaching the behavior and driving significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>. These programs are fully automated, tracking referrals and delivering rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.

### [[building_a_successful_sales_funnel | Lead Magnets]] and Content Gating
Lead magnets are digital (or physical) assets that people sign up for, related to the main offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>. They are highly effective for acquisition when paired with social media promotion (e.g., X, LinkedIn) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. Custom landing pages and automated email flows can be set up to deliver the lead magnet while simultaneously subscribing the user to the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.

Additionally, email gating can be applied to web posts, requiring visitors to subscribe to read the full content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. This turns published content into a continuous lead magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.

### Beehiiv's Boost Network
The Boost Network is a two-sided marketplace within Beehiiv that facilitates both organic and paid subscriber acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

*   **Organic Recommendations**: Publishers can organically recommend other newsletters within the Beehiiv ecosystem, driving passive subscribers without cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.
*   **Paid Acquisitions**: Newsletters can pay a per-subscriber fee (e.g., $2-4 per lead) to be promoted by other publishers within their signup flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>. This allows for rapid scaling of subscriber growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.
    *   **Quality Control**: Publishers only pay for engaged subscribers, with verification steps to ensure quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. Features like "auto-pause" automatically cut off underperforming channels based on metrics like open rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
    *   **Targeting**: Geographic filters can be applied to ensure payment only for subscribers from desired regions (e.g., US, Canada) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

This system creates a "vending machine" effect, where money invested in acquiring subscribers yields greater returns on the back end through monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>.

## [[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | Monetization Strategies]] for Newsletters

Tyler's newsletter, Big Desk Energy, generates between $20,000 and $30,000 per month as a side project, with only five hours of work per week, primarily through sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Sponsorships and Ads
*   **Direct Sponsorship Storefront**: Beehiiv provides a built-in sponsorship storefront that can be embedded on a newsletter's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>. This storefront displays newsletter stats and available ad inventory, allowing advertisers to directly book placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>. Beehiiv charges a flat $10 transaction fee per booking, not a percentage of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.
*   **Beehiiv Ad Network**: This network connects publishers with premium advertisers (e.g., Netflix, Nike, HubSpot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Beehiiv provisions ads to the best-fit publishers, who can choose the copy and run dates, earning per click (e.g., $3-4 per click) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. This simplifies the ad sales process, with automated reporting and asset integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.

### Paid Subscriptions
Beehiiv allows users to offer paid subscriptions, charging readers monthly or annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>. The platform does not take a cut of subscription revenue (only Stripe's 2% fee applies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. Many users generate over $100,000 annually through paid subscriptions, with some journalists pushing for $1 million in revenue in their first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>. Paid tiers can offer exclusive content or community access (e.g., Slack, Discord) via APIs and webhooks for automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>.

### Passive Revenue from Boost Network
As mentioned, publishers can earn passively by promoting other newsletters within their signup flow through the Boost Network, receiving a per-lead payment for new subscribers referred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.

### Affiliate Programs
Beehiiv itself offers a highly competitive affiliate program, paying 50% commission for new users referred to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>. Top affiliates can even win trips to destinations like Maui <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. This presents a unique [[online_business_creation_and_growth | online business creation and growth]] opportunity by combining newsletter growth with affiliate earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

## Keys to Success

*   **Consistency**: Regularly publishing content, even if it's brief, builds trust and engagement, forming the foundation of a brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>. Consistent online sharing can open doors to new opportunities like angel investing and networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
*   **Investment**: Encouraging subscribers to invest time or information (like completing a survey) can increase their commitment and engagement with the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.
*   **Clear Goals**: Define the primary purpose of the newsletter, whether it's primarily for revenue, community building, thought leadership, or as a channel for other businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.

Beehiiv's North Star is ensuring users make more money through the platform than they pay for it, aiming for an ROI-positive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>.

People are actively searching for "TikTok templates" and "viral formats" to replicate for their own brands and campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This trend is backed by substantial search volume, with "TikTok template trend" seeing 98,000 searches in the past month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.

## The Opportunity

The core opportunity lies in providing users with access to, and easy implementation of, currently [[tips_for_going_viral_on_social_media | viral content formats]] and templates on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

One example highlighted was an app that achieved zero to 100,000 downloads on the App Store in just 15 days by leveraging TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. This demonstrates the immense reach and potential for rapid growth that effective TikTok strategies offer.

## Business Models

### Newsletter Service

One immediate business idea is to create an email newsletter that identifies and disseminates currently [[tips_for_going_virial_on_social_media | viral TikTok formats]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.

> [!example] Concept
> A newsletter titled something like, "Here's the formats that are going viral this week on TikTok and here's how you can go and use these for your brand right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

This model can be inspired by existing successful ventures:

*   **Memelord Technologies (Jason Levan):** This company sends daily email newsletters featuring viral meme templates, allowing users to jump directly into an editor to create their own versions with one click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
*   **Adaptation for TikTok:** The same concept could apply to TikTok, providing viral formats and templates directly into an editor for users to build their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

### Evolution to a Platform

While starting with a newsletter is a viable first step, the business could evolve into a more comprehensive platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>:

*   **Video Editor:** Develop a dedicated video editor specifically for creating content using these viral TikTok templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.
*   **Social Scheduling:** Integrate a social scheduling application to streamline the posting process for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   **Monetization:** A paid newsletter version could offer daily updates, while a free version provides weekly insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

## Acquisition Strategies

### Twitter Threads

A highly effective [[influencer_marketing_tactics_on_tiktok | marketing tactic]] for audience acquisition is to create Twitter threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

> [!tip] Implementation
> -   Structure threads like "Here's the five formats that are going viral on TikTok this week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
> -   Break down each format with examples.
> -   Include a call to action at the bottom of the thread: "Join my email newsletter to get these daily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.

This strategy is successfully employed by figures like Short Form Content, who analyze successful app strategies on TikTok and show the content mix and format to be copied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.

### General Social Media Growth Principles

*   **Platform-Specific Content:** Understand that what works on one platform may not work on another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Be "agnostic to what works" and let data guide your strategy. Do more of what performs well and less of what doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** "Just showing up" consistently can beat 95% of competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **Reinforcement:** Identify working formats, replicate them, and continuously adapt to new trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.

Vertical SaaS, or industry-specific software, presents a significant opportunity for entrepreneurs, despite often being perceived as "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This sector has immense potential due to its focus on optimizing processes, increasing efficiency, and generating cost or time savings within specific industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. While venture capitalists often chase broader, multi-billion dollar opportunities, this has led many founders away from industry-specific software, creating a gap for focused development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## A Scientific Approach to Vertical SaaS

[[Building a vertical SaaS business | Building a vertical SaaS business]] is described as a "science" rather than an "art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It doesn't begin with a grand idea, but rather with a systematic selection of an industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### 1. Picking an Industry, Not an Idea

The initial step is to select an industry that has specific characteristics making it ripe for vertical SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>:

*   **Market Size (Revenue)**: Look at the total revenue generated by companies within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Number of Companies**: A high number of companies is preferred. Industries with fewer companies (e.g., General Medical and Surgical Hospitals with ~2,500 companies doing nearly a trillion in revenue) tend to be enterprise-driven, requiring extensive features and making sales more difficult for new bootstrapped ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Segmentation**: The ideal market has a healthy mix of small businesses (doing a few million in revenue), mid-market businesses (tens to hundreds of millions), and enterprise-level businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. It's easier to start by acquiring small to mid-sized businesses with fewer features and then expand capabilities to serve larger enterprises over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

An example of a good opportunity is machine shops: they generate $240 billion in revenue, have 22,000 companies, and exhibit beautiful segmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Even without prior domain expertise in an industry, it's possible to succeed; intense study and on-the-ground validation are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### 2. Mapping the Customer Journey and Operations

Once an industry is chosen, the next crucial step is to map out the entire end-to-end customer journey and operations of businesses within that industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This visualization helps identify where software opportunities lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

*   **Example from Toast (restaurant software)**: Their S1 filing visualized every aspect of restaurant operations, from back office to delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Example from Corsky (trade schools)**: Operations include admissions, training (often in non-classroom settings), IT, student services, compliance, and job placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

By understanding the workflow, one can pinpoint specific areas where software can improve efficiency, save costs, or generate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

### 3. Analyzing Profit & Loss (P&L) Statements

Accessing and analyzing P&L statements from various businesses within the chosen industry is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This reveals where companies are currently spending money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Sources include publicly traded companies and industry-focused bankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

Software solutions should:
*   Increase revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>
*   Decrease costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>
*   Prevent customer churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>
*   Maintain compliance (especially for regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>

The goal is to identify expenses, particularly those involving human labor that could be automated, or existing software that is underperforming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

### 4. [[Competitive analysis in SaaS | Competitive Analysis]]

Evaluate existing software solutions in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Typically, one will find:
*   **Legacy Providers**: Old, all-encompassing ERP systems that might be decades old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Horizontal Solutions**: Businesses stitching together general-purpose software like CRMs, Slack, or Gmail, indicating a desire for an all-in-one vertical solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **Paper Processes**: Surprisingly, many industries still rely on manual, paper-based workflows in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

When performing [[Competitive analysis in SaaS | competitive analysis]], do not simply Google "industry software." Instead, break down the industry's operations (as mapped in step 2) and investigate the solutions (or lack thereof) for each specific bucket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. This uncovers precise opportunities, such as paper-based academic tracking or outsourced compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

### 5. [[Leveraging AI and software solutions in vertical SaaS | Leveraging AI for Research]]

AI tools like ChatGPT can serve as a research assistant for initial market exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

*   **Market Data**: Ask for market size, revenue, number of companies, and segmentation (e.g., machine shops in the USA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **Operational Workflows**: Prompt AI to describe an industry's end-to-end operations (e.g., machine shop operations from quote to cleanup) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
*   **Existing Software**: Query AI about prevalent software solutions and how they map to the operational process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Identify areas still using pen and paper, those not leveraging AI, or those relying on multiple horizontal solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

*Caveat*: While AI is useful for desk research, it's crucial to validate all information in person by engaging with businesses in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Offering to buy lunch and observe operations can be an effective way to gain insights, especially in blue-collar industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

### 6. Go-to-Market Strategy

Before investing significant time, understand and be comfortable with the distribution strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. A great product is ineffective without users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

*   **Study Successful Vertical SaaS Companies**: Research how established companies in the space acquired their first 10, 100, and 1,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   **Sales-Led vs. Product-Led/Marketing-Led**: Many vertical SaaS industries have traditionally relied on heavy, relationship-based outside sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Venture capitalists often prefer product-led or marketing-led acquisition due to faster growth potential, especially for companies without massive average contract values (ACVs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   **Creative [[Marketing strategies for SaaS startups | Marketing strategies for SaaS startups]]**: Consider innovative approaches like industry-specific newsletters or viral content (e.g., daily funny machine shop memes) to build an audience and foster advocacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

### 7. Wedge Products

A "wedge product" is a crucial part of the product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

*   **Definition**: It's a "get-in-the-door" product, not the all-in-one solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Nobody starts with an all-in-one solution, as it takes too long and spreads focus too thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. A wedge product focuses on a specific, important problem that is currently being done poorly (e.g., on paper or with bad competition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   **Characteristics**:
    *   Easy to implement and deploy quickly (not a 12-month implementation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
    *   Acts as a "reputation prover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
    *   Often has a transaction-based business model, rather than a monthly SaaS fee, to enable marketing-led customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Example (Roofer.com)**: They started with a free proposal tool for roofing companies that used Google Maps for estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. This allowed them to acquire customers via digital marketing, which was unheard of in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. After gaining trust, they expanded into CRM and eventually aim for an all-in-one solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

### 8. Monetization: Owning the Transaction with Payments

For vertical SaaS, adding payment processing capabilities is a key strategy to [[Business model for microstartups and vertical SAS | build massive companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

*   **Market Size Expansion**: By taking a percentage of every transaction, a vertical SaaS company dramatically increases its total addressable market beyond just software subscription fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. For example, Toast's market size expanded from $120 million (software) to a share of the trillion-dollar restaurant revenue by integrating payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.
*   **Customer Convenience**: Integrating payments makes the workflow seamless for the customer, eliminating the need for external tools and manual data reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. This often means providing solutions before or after the core transaction, eventually capturing the transaction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

### 9. [[Pricing strategies for vertical SaaS products | Pricing Strategies for vertical SaaS products]]

[[Pricing strategies for vertical SaaS products | Pricing strategies for vertical SaaS products]] are often overlooked but are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

*   **Value-Based Pricing**: Determine how much the problem being solved costs the customer today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **ROI-Driven Model**: Price the product based on the demonstrable return on investment (ROI) it provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Example (Retention Tool)**: A retention tool for trade schools that cost $20,000 in tuition per student, helping to save just a few students from dropping out, could generate millions in savings for the school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. The software could then be priced as a portion of that saving, offering clear value and ROI to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Core Business Outcomes**: Prioritize [[Building a niche AI SaaS business | building a niche AI SaaS business]] that directly increases revenue, decreases costs, prevents churn, or helps with compliance, as these are the areas where clear ROI can be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

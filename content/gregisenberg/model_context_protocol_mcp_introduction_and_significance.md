The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has gained significant attention, despite many people not fully understanding its implications and the startup opportunities it presents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Professor Ross Mike explains MCP as a crucial evolution for Large Language Models (LLMs), designed to make them more capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

## The Need for MCP: Limitations of LLMs and Tools

In programming, standards like REST APIs are vital for engineers to build systems that communicate effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. However, LLMs, by themselves, are incapable of performing meaningful actions beyond predicting the next word or answering questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. For example, an LLM cannot send an email on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

The first evolution in enhancing LLM capability involved combining them with "tools" or APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This allows LLMs to perform actions like searching the internet (e.g., Perplexity) or automating tasks (e.g., using Zapier to log emails in a spreadsheet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

However, this approach has significant drawbacks:
*   **Complexity** It becomes frustrating and cumbersome to build assistants that perform multiple tasks, as it involves "gluing a bunch of different tools" to LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Incohesion** Stacking tools on top of each other and making them work cohesively is a nightmare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Manual Work** This approach requires significant manual work, step-by-step planning, and is prone to edge cases and failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Maintenance Headaches** Updates to external service APIs can break existing integrations, making maintenance terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **LLM Limitations** LLMs, by themselves, are "very very dumb" and can hallucinate if not properly managed when interacting with tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This difficulty is why a "Jarvis level assistant" is not yet prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a standard that creates a unified language for LLMs to interact with various external services and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

Think of it as a translation layer:
> "Think of every tool that I have to connect to to make my llm valuable... as a different language so tool one's English, tool two is Spanish, tool three is Japanese... mCP you can consider it to be a layer between your llm and the services and the tools and this layer translates all those different languages into a unified language that makes complete sense to the llm." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>

### The MCP Ecosystem

The MCP ecosystem comprises four main components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>:
1.  **MCP Client** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>: The client-facing or LLM-facing side of the ecosystem (e.g., Tempo, Windswept, Cursor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
2.  **MCP Protocol** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>: The two-way connection between the client and the server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
3.  **MCP Server** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>: Translates the external service's capabilities and what it can do to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Notably, the MCP server is designed to be constructed and maintained by the service provider (e.g., a database company builds its own MCP server for LLM access) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
4.  **Service** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>: The external tool or database that the LLM needs to interact with.

## Significance and Impact of MCP

MCP aims to make LLMs "more capable" by providing a standardized way for them to access outside resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

Key benefits include:
*   **Unified Communication** It unifies the LLM and the service, creating an efficient communication layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Seamless Integration** MCP simplifies the connection and access of LLMs to different outside resources like databases (e.g., Convex, Superbase), reducing the complexity of manual integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
*   **Reduced Engineering Overhead** When all parties follow the MCP standard, LLMs can access everything they need, making the process smoother for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## Current State and [[Challenges and opportunities in using MCP for startup ideas | Challenges]]

While MCP is a significant step, it is still in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
*   **Technical Challenges** Setting up an MCP server can be "annoying," involving local files and various kinks that need to be ironed out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Standardization** It's uncertain if MCP will become the finalized standard or if it will be challenged or updated by other major players like OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

## [[Challenges and opportunities in using MCP for startup ideas | Startup Opportunities]]

For technical individuals, an "MCP App Store" could be a viable idea, allowing users to easily deploy and connect MCP servers from repositories to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

For non-technical individuals and entrepreneurs, the key is to stay informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. While there are no immediate "crazy business opportunities" right now, observing the evolution and finalization of this standard is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. Once the standard is solidified and adopted by service providers, integrating and building solutions will become much easier, opening the door for new business ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

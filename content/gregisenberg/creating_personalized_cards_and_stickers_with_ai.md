The use of AI tools offers significant opportunities for creating personalized content, such as Disney-style images and animated avatars, which can drive revenue for businesses through effective storytelling and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. By understanding how to utilize tools like Leonardo AI, Cling AI, and ChatGPT, individuals can build profitable ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Evolution of Business in the AI Era

The business landscape has undergone a massive transition, influenced by factors like COVID and the emergence of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This shift has impacted product development, marketing, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Traditional Business Playbook
Historically, launching a tech product required significant venture capital, years of development, and hiring software engineers, leading to high costs and extended product cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Marketing often involved social media budgets, creative teams, and seasonal, large-scale campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Operations relied on hiring talent for productivity and physical office spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### The New Playbook with AI
AI has brought about a technical shift in product development, allowing for instant and low-cost creation with zero employees, eliminating the need for extensive engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

There's also been an audience shift in marketing, characterized by the rise of solopreneurs who engage audiences through transparency and "always-on" storytelling, sharing their journey and financial progress daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This approach is now being adopted even by large organizations like WWE and UFC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Operationally, a cultural shift has occurred with remote working, reducing office costs and enabling global talent acquisition. This allows for leaner teams and faster product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. AI tools can perform the work of multiple people, enabling individuals to sprint with their own ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## Sequential Prompting for AI-Powered Creation

Omar introduces "sequential prompting" as a third technique for [[using_ai_tools_for_content_creation | utilizing AI tools]], in addition to conversational and master prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### How Sequential Prompting Works
Sequential prompting involves using one AI tool, like ChatGPT, to generate a prompt that is then used in a different AI tool to create a new output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

*   **Step 1 (ChatGPT)**: Ask ChatGPT to generate a specific prompt for another AI tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Step 2 (Other AI Tool)**: Take the generated prompt and feed it into a tool like Leonardo AI for image creation or Cling AI for animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Voiceovers can be added using tools like Eleven Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

This process can be done manually for iteration and feedback, then automated programmatically via APIs using tools like Zapier or Make for more complex integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Business Ideas Leveraging AI Avatars

The ability to create and customize AI avatars opens up numerous business opportunities, particularly for [[using_ai_for_storytelling_and_marketing | storytelling and marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### 1. AI-First Personalized Greeting Cards
This idea builds on the concept of custom greeting card businesses like Moonpig.com, which generates hundreds of millions in revenue annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

*   **Process**:
    1.  **Generate Character Prompt**: Use ChatGPT to create a detailed description (prompt) for a character based on an uploaded image, ensuring character consistency across different scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. ChatGPT can assess the image and provide descriptions of hairstyle, skin tone, and outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.
    2.  **Generate Images**: Input the generated prompt into Leonardo AI to create high-resolution, Disney/Pixar-style images of the character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
    3.  **Add Text**: Use ChatGPT to incorporate custom text into the image prompt, such as "Good luck on your first day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.

*   **Business Model Potential**:
    *   **Custom Storytelling**: Create personalized stories or narratives featuring custom avatars, similar to a children's book where a child sees themselves as a character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
    *   **AI-Enhanced Templates**: Offer dynamic templates that adapt to user inputs, including preferred tone, voice, and video integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.
    *   **Revenue Streams**:
        *   **Premium Card Sales**: Sell personalized cards at a markup (e.g., $5-$10) due to AI-driven personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
        *   **Monthly Memberships**: Offer subscriptions for unlimited cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>.
        *   **Upselling**: Bundle with matching gifts like flowers or chocolates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.
    *   **[[using_ai_for_design_and_branding | Design and Interface]]**: Create a user-friendly interface (e.g., "Teeny Tales") that allows users to upload images, select themes, and generate stories, providing an interactive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>. The AI models run in the background via APIs, feeding content to the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.
    *   **Market Opportunity**: These tools can be used for B2B (business-to-business) or B2C (business-to-consumer) social content, offering millions of dollars in potential revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.

### 2. Animated Greetings and Memes with Cling AI
Beyond static images, AI can bring characters to life for dynamic content.

*   **Cling AI**: This tool excels at turning static images into short videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
    *   **Workflow**: Upload an image (e.g., from Leonardo AI) to Cling AI to generate an animated video clip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
    *   **Lip Sync**: Cling AI has a feature to lip-sync text, allowing characters to "speak" words provided by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
    *   **Applications**: Create animated greeting cards, personalized memes, or short video clips to capture funny moments with friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
    *   **Current Limitations**: Video generation can currently take several minutes (e.g., 4 minutes for a 5-second clip), which may require a manual fulfillment process or virtual assistants for premium offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. This speed is expected to improve rapidly with advancements like Sora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

### 3. Personalized Stickers (and Physical Products) with AI
This [[startup_ideas_using_ai_technology | startup idea]] combines AI image generation with print-on-demand services to create physical products.

*   **Concept**: AI-generated personalized stickers for various purposes, such as "well done" stickers for teachers featuring their own animated faces or custom stickers for children as incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.
*   **Workflow**:
    1.  **Image Generation**: Use ChatGPT to create a "kiss-cut sticker artwork" prompt, then generate the image with Leonardo AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>. Ensure a plain background for easy removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.
    2.  **Background Removal**: Use a tool like remove.bg (which has an API) to automatically remove the background from the generated image, creating a clean PNG sticker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
    3.  **Print-on-Demand**: Integrate with a print-on-demand service like Printful (via their API), which offers various products beyond stickers, such as clothing and t-shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. This allows for an automated fulfillment process from image creation to shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.
*   **Marketing Strategy**: Employ "guerrilla marketing" tactics, such as visiting school websites, finding staff photos, generating personalized stickers with their AI avatars, and mailing them as a unique and attention-grabbing demonstration of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>. This approach can also be used for [[generating_content_with_ai_tools | generating content with AI tools]] on social media for top-of-funnel growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

By combining AI image generation, sequential prompting, and automation with print-on-demand services, entrepreneurs can create new product categories that evoke positive emotions and offer significant market potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.

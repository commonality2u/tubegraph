AI is transforming traditional industries by enabling new application functionalities and streamlining archaic processes. This shift is driven by the intersection of advanced AI tools and innovative distribution tactics, particularly on platforms like TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Examples of AI Applications

### Umax: Facial Analysis
Umax, an application focused on facial analysis and recommendations, showcases how AI can democratize previously complex technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. While such functionality was possible before, it required significant investment in developing proprietary machine learning models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. With the advent of AI, specifically GPT Vision, Umax was built with essentially zero upfront development cost, aside from the developer's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This highlights how AI enables the creation of personalized, real-time functional applications that were once prohibitively expensive to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Cal AI: Calorie Tracking
Cal AI demonstrates [[adding_ai_intelligence_to_manual_processes | adding AI intelligence to manual processes]] in an "archaic" industry: calorie tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Traditional apps like MyFitnessPal often frustrated users due to their difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Cal AI simplifies this process through AI, redefining the value users get from such applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The application's calorie estimations based on images are significantly more robust than those of competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.

## AI App Ideas for Traditional Industries

Entrepreneurs are encouraged to think about redefining the value users receive from applications, rather than solely leveraging viral marketing tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The focus should be on how AI can make existing processes easier and more efficient.

### Career AI
An "all-in-one integrated platform" called Career AI could consolidate various fragmented career advancement tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This would include functionalities like:
*   **Resume analysis:** Providing feedback and improvement suggestions on resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This could be made viral by offering a "six-factor Madden rating system" for different resume sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.
*   **Career quizzes:** Recommending future careers based on personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. A viral element could involve users sharing their recommended careers, potentially leading to humorous or relatable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Job application guidance:** Offering courses or tips on applying for different jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

This type of platform could appeal to students and recent graduates struggling with job searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> and could potentially charge a monthly subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Journal AI
Journal AI is envisioned as an "AI second brain" framed as a journal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, offering intricate and objective analysis on entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. While many journaling apps exist, the AI angle offers a unique value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. Many people already use conversational AIs like ChatGPT as their personal journals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

Key features and benefits of Journal AI could include:
*   Increased productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   Emotional support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   Relationship analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

The technical implementation would not need to be overly robust, essentially using AI with enhanced memory storage and a user-friendly journaling interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. It's crucial not to brand it as an "AI therapist" to avoid misrepresentation and regulatory issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

### Language AI / Language Tutoring Application
Despite the dominance of Duolingo, there is an opportunity to create a "language AI" or language tutoring application by integrating new AI functionalities more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
This application would leverage AI for dynamic learning, moving beyond the static modules found in traditional platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. The current high cost of AI voice models (like ChatGPT's voice model) is expected to decrease over time, making such applications more feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

The advantage of a new entrant over established players like Duolingo or MyFitnessPal is the ability to iterate and progress more quickly due to different internal incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Even capturing a small percentage of the market share can lead to a massive product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. The demand for language learning, as seen by trending searches on platforms like TikTok Creator Insights, indicates a large existing and growing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.

## The Future of AI Apps
The current wave of AI apps is pioneering new ways for people to learn and improve themselves through personalized learning tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Initially, these are seen as AI tools doing the tutoring through their UI, rather than being explicitly framed as "AI tutors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. There is ample room for new AI applications to coexist with established players by pioneering completely novel functionalities within traditional spaces like language learning, calorie tracking, career advancement, and journaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

These [[building_automated_businesses_with_ai | building automated businesses with AI]] and [[automating_business_processes_with_ai | automating business processes with AI]] often stem from straightforward ideas that, when combined with new execution styles in functionality and distribution, can lead to massive applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>. The [[future_of_ai_in_business_operations | future of AI in business operations]] indicates a 10x improvement in end-user experience for interacting with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Custom GPTs represent a significant opportunity in the evolving AI landscape, allowing for personalized applications and services that can monetize specialized data or serve as lead generation mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. The general insight is that what worked for web marketing in 2010 is now outdated, and the current technological capabilities allow for much more dynamic and personalized solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## Evolution of Directories to Custom GPTs

Traditional directory companies, like Nomad List, aggregated data to provide structured information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. The next evolution for these services is to become custom GPTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. This allows users to engage in a conversational interface, specifying unique criteria such as desired weather, budget constraints, or visa requirements, leading to a much more personalized experience than static directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

## Monetization and Lead Generation

Currently, direct monetization from custom GPTs is not widely observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. However, there's a notable example of a lawyer using top legal GPTs for lead generation, where users prompting for contract or legal information are then offered the services of a real lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. This indicates that custom GPTs can be effective as a lead generation mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. For a custom GPT to be monetizable, it needs to leverage specialized data that is not readily available through general [[AI Tools like Midjourney and Chat GPT | ChatGPT]] or Claude, ensuring a unique value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

## Proposed Business Applications

### 1. Open Page Creator
The concept of "open pages" involves individuals openly sharing personal statistics, much like startups share revenue or user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. These can include anything from books being read, exercise consistency, or glucose monitor readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

*   **Technology Enablement**: Modern tools, like Cursor or Bolt, allow almost anyone to quickly create such pages, making it much easier than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. For example, a surfing stats page was created using Cursor by someone who had never coded, demonstrating dynamic animations and data tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Social Motivation**: There's a desire for social motivation and leaderboards, as seen with platforms like Strava where users share their running data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. An open page can reflect personality, combining art and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Monetization Model**: A freemium model could be adopted, offering a simple free page and then upcharging for additional modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This could include specialized integrations for fitness influencers (e.g., showing affiliations or supplements) or improved embeds for platforms like Strava, which currently offer poor data visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Lead Magnet Integration**: Personal webpages could integrate an "open knowledge page" that gates content to capture email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This is crucial for creators to own their audience's contact information, especially given changing social media algorithms and newsletter fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### 2. Integrated Health Platform
There is a need for a centralized platform that integrates various health data streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

*   **Data Aggregation**: This platform would combine data from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), Strava, blood tests (e.g., Function Health), doctor visits, and medication information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. APIs for devices like Dexcom, Abbott (CGM), and Strava exist, allowing for data import <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   **AI-Powered Analysis**: An [[ChatGPT Pro vs Perplexity AI for startup building | AI]] layer, similar to [[ChatGPT Pro vs Perplexity AI for startup building | ChatGPT]], could analyze this aggregated data to offer suggestions or identify potential issues, such as medication side effects impacting athletic performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. This "digital doctor" layer would not prescribe but would allow users to interrogate their health ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Actionable Insights**: Current health products like Oura rings provide data but often lack actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. This platform would bridge that gap.
*   **Monetization**: Users would likely pay a substantial subscription fee (e.g., $30+ per month) for such a comprehensive service, especially when trying to solve specific health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. It could also be offered as an employee perk by businesses or health insurance companies, incentivizing healthy behaviors through rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
*   **Health Assistant**: The platform could serve as an ongoing health assistant, providing personalized reminders or "micro fixes" for habit building, like drinking water or improving posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

### 3. AI-Powered Dating Apps
The current dating app landscape is primarily based on looks, which often doesn't capture key compatibility factors like humor or intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

*   **Beyond Swiping**: An [[AI-generated startup ideas | AI-powered]] dating app could move beyond photo-based swiping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. It could assess compatibility based on users' reactions to memes to gauge humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
*   **Integrated Profiles**: The app could integrate with other applications that reflect user interests, such as Goodreads, Netflix, or Strava, and potentially even open pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   **AI Matchmaking**: An AI matchmaker could facilitate "blind dates" by setting up meeting times and locations, removing the logistical friction of dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. The AI could also provide conversation prompts based on shared interests identified from integrated data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. The future of dating may involve no swiping at all, essentially an AI-arranged match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

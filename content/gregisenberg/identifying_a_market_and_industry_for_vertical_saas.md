Building a [[what_is_vertical_saas_and_its_advantages | vertical SaaS]] business requires a scientific, rather than artistic, approach, focusing first on identifying the right industry instead of conceiving a grand idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:10">[04:30:10]</a>. This method, advocated by [[what_is_vertical_saas_and_its_advantages | vertical SaaS]] advisor Luke Sfinos, emphasizes a step-by-step framework to uncover opportunities in often "boring" but highly profitable niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

## Picking an Industry Over an Idea

The initial and most crucial step is to select an industry, not an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. This is considered a scientific, mathematical approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

Key characteristics that make an industry suitable for [[what_is_vertical_saas_and_its_advantages | vertical SaaS]] include:
*   **Market Size (Revenue)**: Understanding the total revenue generated by companies within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. For example, General Medical and Surgical Hospitals in the US generate nearly a trillion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.
*   **Number of Companies**: This indicates the industry's fragmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. An industry with many companies, even if it has high revenue, is less enterprise-driven and easier for bootstrappers to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.
*   **Segmentation**: The ideal market has a healthy mix of small businesses (a couple million USD revenue/year), mid-market businesses (10-100 million USD revenue/year), and enterprise-level businesses (over 100 million USD revenue/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. Starting with smaller businesses allows for easier entry with a smaller feature set, which can then be expanded to serve larger clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

An example of a promising industry identified through this framework is machine shops, which generate 240 billion USD in revenue across 22,000 companies and are beautifully segmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

## Understanding the Industry and Its Operations

Even without prior domain expertise, it's possible to build a successful [[what_is_vertical_saas_and_its_advantages | vertical SaaS]] business by diligently learning about the chosen industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. Luke Sfinos, for instance, built a significant [[what_is_vertical_saas_and_its_advantages | vertical SaaS]] business in trade schools without prior knowledge of the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.

The key step is to:
*   **Map the entire customer journey and operations**: This involves visualizing every aspect of how businesses within the industry operate, from end-to-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. For example, Toast (restaurant software) mapped out every component of a restaurant's operations in their S1 filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>, and Sfinos did the same for trade schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. This visualization helps identify where software opportunities exist and their potential scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:15]</a>.
*   **Leverage [[the_role_of_ai_and_payment_integration_in_vertical_saas | AI]] as a research assistant**: Tools like ChatGPT can help gather high-level information like market size and segmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>. However, for detailed workflow analysis (e.g., every step in a machine shop's operation), direct validation and observation are still necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>.

## Following the Money (P&L Analysis)

To identify lucrative problem sets, analyze Profit & Loss (P&L) statements from various businesses within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>.
*   **Sources of P&Ls**: Publicly traded companies in the space or by talking to bankers who regularly buy and sell companies in that industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>.
*   **Identify Spending Patterns**: Understand where companies are spending money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>. This includes expenses on people that could be automated by software, and existing software solutions, and their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>.
*   **Value Creation**: Software should aim to:
    *   Increase Revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>
    *   Decrease Costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>
    *   Prevent Customer Churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>
    *   Maintain Compliance (especially in highly regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>

## [[competitive_analysis_for_saas_development | Analyzing Competition]]

Instead of focusing on pre-conceived ideas, analyze existing software solutions in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. This involves looking beyond simple Google searches for "industry software" and digging into each operational bucket identified in the customer journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>.

Common competitive landscapes include:
*   **Legacy Providers**: Old, comprehensive ERP systems that might be 30 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>.
*   **Horizontal Software Stitching**: Businesses combining general-purpose tools (e.g., CRM for any business, Slack, Gmail, Zoho) that aren't industry-specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>. These present opportunities for an all-in-one [[what_is_vertical_saas_and_its_advantages | vertical SaaS]] solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>.
*   **Paper Processes**: Surprisingly, many industries, even in 2024, still rely on manual, paper-based workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>. This is a clear opportunity for digitization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>. [[the_role_of_ai_and_payment_integration_in_vertical_saas | AI]] can assist in identifying areas still reliant on pen and paper, as well as areas not yet leveraging [[the_role_of_ai_and_payment_integration_in_vertical_saas | AI]] or using multiple horizontal solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:38:00">[28:38:00]</a>.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

Before investing significant time, understand the go-to-market strategy for the chosen industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:23:00">[35:23:00]</a>. A great product without users is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>.

*   **Study successful [[what_is_vertical_saas_and_its_advantages | vertical SaaS]] companies**: Research how they acquired their first 10, 100, and 1,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:53:00">[35:53:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Model Considerations**: Many [[what_is_vertical_saas_and_its_advantages | vertical SaaS]] industries historically require heavy outside sales models (country clubby, relationship-based) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:30:00">[36:30:00]</a>. Venture Capitalists (VCs) often prefer product-led or marketing-led customer acquisition for faster growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:04:00">[37:04:00]</a>. If choosing a sales-led model, Average Contract Values (ACVs) must be substantial to build a large company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:20:00">[37:20:00]</a>.
*   **Media and Creative Approaches**: Explore whether industry participants are on social media or receptive to creative [[marketing_strategies_for_saas_products | marketing]] (e.g., newsletters with industry-specific humor for machine shops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:53:00">[37:53:00]</a>. This can build an audience and trust for future [[developing_niche_ai_saas_products | product]] launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>.

## Wedge Products

A "wedge product" is a "get in the door" product designed to establish a foothold in the market and build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24:00">[40:24:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to become the all-in-one solution, but no one starts there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:39:00">[40:39:00]</a>.

Characteristics of a successful wedge product:
*   **Addresses a critical, poorly-handled problem**: It targets an area that is either on paper or has inefficient, "shitty" competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:00]</a>.
*   **Easy to implement and deploy quickly**: Avoids long, complex implementation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:35:00">[41:35:00]</a>.
*   **Reputation prover**: It demonstrates value and builds credibility with the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>.
*   **Creates trust**: It should be designed to build maximum trust with the customer, often by helping them close business or achieve clear wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:06:00">[46:06:00]</a>.

A prime example is Roofer.com, which started with a free proposal tool using Google Maps for instant quotes. This allowed them to acquire roofing companies via digital [[marketing_strategies_for_saas_products | marketing]], an anomaly in home services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:34:00">[43:34:00]</a>. After gaining trust, they expanded to offer a CRM, moving towards an all-in-one solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:20:00">[44:20:00]</a>. This strategy leverages the fact that it's easier to sell more products to an existing customer than acquire a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:57:00">[44:57:00]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_pricing_and_monetization_in_vertical_saas | Pricing]] and [[the_role_of_ai_and_payment_integration_in_vertical_saas | Payment Integration]]

[[strategies_for_pricing_and_monetization_in_vertical_saas | Pricing]] is often overlooked but is crucial for [[what_is_vertical_saas_and_its_advantages | vertical SaaS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:42:00">[49:42:00]</a>.

*   **Value-based [[strategies_for_pricing_and_monetization_in_vertical_saas | Pricing]]**: Understand the monetary cost of the problem being solved for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:01:00">[50:01:00]</a>. Price the product based on the tangible value it delivers (e.g., increased revenue, saved costs, reduced churn). For instance, a retention tool for trade schools was priced based on the tuition saved from preventing student dropouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:01:00">[51:01:00]</a>. The general rule is to charge a portion of the money saved or generated for the customer, often starting around 50% and adjusting based on market feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:05:00">[52:05:00]</a>.
*   **[[the_role_of_ai_and_payment_integration_in_vertical_saas | Payment Integration]]**: Integrating payments directly into the [[what_is_vertical_saas_and_its_advantages | vertical SaaS]] solution is a powerful way to build massive companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:31:00">[46:31:00]</a>. If a wedge product can be built before or after the transaction, it eventually allows for ownership of the transaction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:22:00">[46:22:00]</a>. Companies like Toast derive significant value by taking a percentage of every transaction that flows through their system, dramatically increasing their total addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:38:00">[47:38:00]</a>.

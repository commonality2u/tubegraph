## Multimodal Language Models for Ad Creation

The integration of [[multimodal_ai_applications | AI]] into ad creation is revolutionizing how businesses approach their marketing strategies, promising increased return on ad spend (ROAS) and greater profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Tools like GPT-4o are at the forefront of this shift, enabling the rapid generation of winning ads and visual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Enhancing Ad Performance
[[optimizing_ad_performance_with_ai | AI]] facilitates the creation of highly effective ads by allowing for experimentation at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Marketers can quickly test various visual elements—such as different demographics (men, women, old, young, diverse colors) or specific styles—to see what resonates best with different audiences and drives higher conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This capability is crucial because even subtle changes, like a model looking left versus right, can significantly impact ROAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Key Features of GPT-4o for Ads
Unlike pure image models, GPT-4o is a [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_llms | multimodal language model]], which means it understands both text and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Reduced Prompting Complexity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>: Prompting is less critical compared to other image generation tools like Midjourney or Ideogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Users can be straightforward in their prompts as GPT-4o has a strong understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Importance of Inspiration Images** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>: The most crucial elements for creating effective ads are the inspiration and product images provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. These images serve as powerful references, often being "worth a thousand words" in guiding the AI's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   **Understanding Well-Known Concepts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>: GPT-4o has a strong grasp of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge wallets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. For such brands, providing reference images may not be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. However, for new or smaller products without significant online presence, supplying a reference image is always recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

### Prompting Strategies
[[effective_ad_prompting_techniques_with_chatgpt | Effective ad prompting techniques with ChatGPT]] focus on clarity and providing visual cues.
*   **Keyword Use**: Use keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to ensure images are photorealistic and avoid cartoonish or oddly colored outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Detailed Descriptions**: While GPT-4o is intelligent, a strong, detailed prose description of the desired image can yield precise results, especially for complex scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Font and Style Control**: The model can understand well-known font types (e.g., "exo2 bold italic") and adjust color styles and aspect ratios based on prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Generating Images Only**: To prevent the AI from generating text representing the ad instead of an image, explicitly prompt it to "generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Directness**: Be clear and direct in what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Starting New Chats for Adjustments**: If the initial prompt results are unsatisfactory, it's best to start a new chat and make adjustments to the prompt there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to a degradation of image quality, as the AI uses its previously generated, potentially flawed, image as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Leveraging Inspiration and Data
[[evolving_ad_design_using_ai_and_inspiration_imagery | Evolving ad design using AI and inspiration imagery]] allows for rapid iteration and adaptation.
*   **Sora Explore Page**: Sora, which uses the same underlying model as GPT-4o, offers an "explore page" where users can view images and their corresponding prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This resource is excellent for understanding effective prompting techniques and for ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Sora is also noted for having less strict policy guidelines and better photo realism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Remixing Existing Ads**: Businesses can use existing successful ads as inspiration, then provide their own product imagery and specific instructions to [[adjusting_and_optimizing_aigenerated_ads | adjust and optimize AI-generated ads]] to their brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This allows for quick adaptation of proven ad concepts for different products, audiences, or even seasonal campaigns (e.g., transforming a Black Friday ad into a Christmas ad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Ad Library Tools**: To find inspiration, users can explore platforms like Creative OS, ForPlay, and Icon.me, which read and tag Meta's ad library, making it easy to search for relevant ad examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

### Practical Application: Creating an Ad for LCA
When [[using_ai_for_copy_and_ad_creative_generation | using AI for copy and ad creative generation]] for a new company, key steps include:
1.  **Gathering Brand Assets**: Screenshots of the company's logo, typography, color scheme, and examples of brands they work with are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
2.  **Selecting Inspiration**: For a luxury brand like LCA (Late Checkout Agency), a vintage Rolex ad could be used as an inspiration image to convey a high-end feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.
3.  **Crafting the Prompt**: Provide context about the company (e.g., "SWAT team design agency," "works with the best companies") and specify the desired output (e.g., "generate a digital ad," "capture the luxury vibe") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
4.  **Iterative Refinement**: Initial generations might include unintended elements (like a Rolex watch in the LCA ad example) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. By starting a new chat and providing clear instructions to replace or adjust these elements, along with specifying desired elements (e.g., showing partner logos instead of a watch), the ad can be refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>.
5.  **Controlling Dimensions**: While GPT-4o defaults to 9x16 aspect ratio, users can specify other dimensions like 1x1 or 9x16 in the prompt for different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

### Future Implications
The accessibility of [[use_of_ai_tools_in_ad_creation | AI tools in ad creation]] means that companies can now create ads that are more personal, funny, and entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. It enables rapid adaptation to trending news cycles or specific events, making it possible to produce relevant ads en masse much faster and more cost-effectively than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. The role of "idea people" becomes even more critical in envisioning unique aesthetics and concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Furthermore, these AI-generated images can potentially be transformed into video content using other tools like Runway and Sora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.

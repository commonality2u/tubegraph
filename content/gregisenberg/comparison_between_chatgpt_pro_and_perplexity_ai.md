This article explores the differences between OpenAI's [[Comparison of AI coding tools | ChatGPT Pro]] and Perplexity AI, focusing on their "Deep Research" capabilities for business ideation and planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The goal is to compare which platform offers better insights and actionable tactics for building a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Understanding Deep Research

Deep research, as offered by both [[Comparison of AI coding tools | ChatGPT]] and Perplexity, is described as akin to having a junior analyst provide in-depth information on a given question, rather than just a quick answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These models go through significantly more sources than standard searches, with Perplexity noted to consult over 29 sources for its initial response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This extensive sourcing is intended to provide a more comprehensive and well-vetted output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Cost Comparison

*   **[[Comparison of AI coding tools | ChatGPT Pro]]**: Costs $200 per month for the Pro Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Perplexity AI**: Costs $20 per month for its deep research features, with some usage possibly available for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.

## Initial Prompt and Requirements

Both AIs were given the same prompt to generate business ideas and playbooks:
> "I want to create a startup. I want it to be an AI agent that focuses on a high value niche. I want it to be defensible, not just a flash in the pan. I want you to create a zero to one playbook of how you'd launch it to get customers. Give me five ideas with five playbooks on how to grow it. I'm looking for $1 million year one, $3 million year two, $5 million year three." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

Follow-up clarifications were provided to [[Comparison of AI coding tools | ChatGPT]] when it requested further information:
*   **Industries**: Looking for startup ideas with the highest likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Target Market**: Open to B2B or B2C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **AI Capabilities**: No preference, seeking highest probability of success with a "moat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Technical Resources**: Prefers an approach that costs $5,000 or less for an MVP, and the user is "not super technical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Funding**: Might want to cash flow the business but is open to VC funding if it can exceed $100 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Go-to-Market**: Leans towards viral, self-serve growth but is open to suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Perplexity did not ask follow-up questions after the initial prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Speed of Response

*   **Perplexity AI**: Generally faster, completing its initial deep research query before [[Comparison of AI coding tools | ChatGPT]] was halfway done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Follow-up queries also took only a couple of minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.
*   **[[Comparison of AI coding tools | ChatGPT Pro]]**: Slower, with initial responses taking around eight minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Follow-up queries also incurred a noticeable delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

## Output Analysis: Business Ideas and Playbooks

### Perplexity AI's Idea: Legal Contract Lifecycle AI Agent

Perplexity proposed an AI agent for legal contract life cycle management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

*   **Problem Space**: Corporate legal teams waste 23% of their time on manual review and face $2.4 billion annually in errors and compliance penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Existing solutions require extensive customization and fail to adapt to negotiation patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Defensible Solution**:
    *   Integrates with email, SharePoint, and DocuSign via API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
    *   Learns organizational risk thresholds from historical contract analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
    *   Auto-redlines third-party documents using firm-specific fallback positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   Maintains version lineage with "blockchain-style" audit trails (though this might be complex for an MVP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Defensibility**: Develops "institutional memory" through continuous exposure to negotiation outcomes, embedding itself in legal department workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Requires significant retraining to replace, equivalent to 6-9 months of human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Perplexity also cited that one of its sources was a YouTube video from the speaker about AI startup ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Growth Playbook**:
    *   **Phase 1 (Niche Validation - 90 days)**: Build a Chrome extension to record legal contract review sessions to train the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Offer free redline audits to 100 AmLaw 200 firms, targeting mid-market companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Monetize at $2,500/month subscription locked to specific document types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
    *   **Phase 2 (Workflow Embedding - Months 4-9)**: Integrate with legal operations platforms (e.g., Lexion, Entra), launch a Clause Library Builder, and implement usage-based pricing at $0.25 per review clause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
    *   **Phase 3 (Enterprise Scaling - Months 10-12)**: Add SOC 2 Type 2 compliance, develop custom connectors, and upsell to an $8,000/month enterprise tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   **Financial Roadmap (ARR)**:
    *   Year 1: $1.2 million (40 clients at $2,500 MRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
    *   Year 2: $3.1 million (150 clients at $5,000 MRR + $250k usage pay) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
    *   Year 3: $5.4 million (300+ embedded instances) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

The speaker found this idea "super valuable" and "defensible," with a "pretty good one-pager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

### [[Comparison of AI coding tools | ChatGPT Pro]]'s Idea: AI Sales Outreach Assistant

[[Comparison of AI coding tools | ChatGPT]] proposed an AI-powered sales outreach assistant functioning as a virtual Sales Development Representative (SDR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

*   **Problem Space**: B2B companies (startups to mid-size firms) need more pipeline without hiring additional SDRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   **Defensible Solution**: Enriches lead data and crafts tailored outreach at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Defensibility**: Based on a "Data Network effect," learning from every interaction (which messaging yields replies) to build a unique dataset of what works in each industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. This leads to superior personalization and lead scoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Integration into CRMs and email systems further deepens the moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
*   **MVP Development (under $5,000)**:
    *   Focus on a narrow, high-value use case, such as automating follow-up emails to warm leads with AI-personalized templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
    *   MVP can be a web app or Chrome extension where a salesperson inputs prospects or connects their CRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
    *   **Cost-saving tactics**: Use existing AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4), simple UI with low-code tools, single-channel focus (email first), and manual fallback for AI uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
    *   The main cost would be freelance developer time and API calls, estimated at less than $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.
*   **Customer Acquisition & Growth**:
    *   **Product-led viral adoption**: Self-serve free tier (e.g., 50 AI-generated emails/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.
    *   **Viral Loop**: Prompt users to share successes internally when the AI books a meeting or gets a reply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
    *   **Content Marketing**: Publish case studies and short demos (e.g., referencing "Jenny AI" or "Cursor" for their successful bottoms-up adoption) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
    *   List in CRM marketplaces like HubSpot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Per-seat pricing or usage-based tiers (e.g., $49/month for solo rep, $199/month for team, Enterprise tier) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.
*   **VC Readiness**: The idea has potential to scale to $100 million ARR, likely requiring VC funding to achieve this scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

The speaker noted that this report was very long and a "full-on business mind map" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

## Follow-up Prompting

Both AIs were given follow-up prompts to refine their initial ideas:

*   **[[Comparison of AI coding tools | ChatGPT]]**: Asked to make the AI Sales Outreach Assistant idea "more non-obvious" and to decide on the idea with "the most legs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
    *   [[Comparison of AI coding tools | ChatGPT]] then proposed an "AI platform for longtail podcasts and sponsors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. This agent would streamline podcast production and bundle small podcasts for advertisers, unlocking the longtail advertising market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. It detailed the competitive moat, proprietary data advantage, and MVP development (under $5,000) using tools like Whisper or AssemblyAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
*   **Perplexity AI**: Asked about highly funded competitors in the AI legal space and how to make the idea more non-obvious, also requesting a step-by-step MVP plan for under $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
    *   Perplexity provided an "executive summary" including a competitive analysis of 37 funded competitors, revealing "under-defended niches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. It presented a "Competitive Opportunity Matrix" and a full MVP implementation plan with a $4,800 budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. The plan detailed a Chrome extension prototype (zero dev cost using Manifest V3 and TensorFlow.js), legal team interviews, and a core feature build with components like a Clause Library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>. It also outlined go-to-market sequencing, including offering free vulnerability audits and pricing strategies like $0.15 per clause auto-redline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.

The speaker emphasized that while both are good, the user still needs to know "the right questions to ask" in follow-up prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.

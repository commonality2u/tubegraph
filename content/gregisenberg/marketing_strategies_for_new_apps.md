This article outlines various [[growth_marketing_strategies for startups | marketing strategies]] for new applications, focusing on practical approaches and tool recommendations discussed in the context of launching a fictional app called "Invoice Nudger."

## Leveraging Product Design for Marketing

A well-designed app, particularly its dashboard, can serve as a powerful marketing tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. Users are often compelled to share screenshots of dashboards that display key performance indicators (KPIs), such as money collected or subscriber growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

Consider the following:
*   **Shareable Metrics**: Identify the most important KPI for your users and find a way to demonstrate their progress visually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   **Visually Appealing Dashboards**: Ensure your dashboard is aesthetically pleasing and easy to screenshot or download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   **Direct Sharing Options**: Include share buttons on data charts or graphs within your app to facilitate easy sharing to platforms like X (Twitter) or Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

## Video Marketing and Storytelling

In the current digital landscape, launching a product without a video is considered unconventional, especially on platforms like X (Twitter) that prioritize video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. Effective storytelling through video is crucial for product launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.

*   **Case Study: Freewrite App**: Farsza TV's Freewrite app launched with a beautifully done video, garnering 1.5 million views and hundreds of downloads per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. The video effectively showcased the app's clean design and distraction-free writing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.
*   **Brand Storytelling**: Develop a distinct brand for your app and create a video that supports that story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. For "Invoice Nudger," the brand could revolve around humorous "mob-like" enforcement of payments, using AI-generated videos or mob movie imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.
*   **AI for Scripting**: Use AI tools like ChatGPT to write scripts for iconic marketing videos, by providing stills from successful videos (e.g., Farsza TV's) and explaining your app's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. You can even ask AI to act as a CMO and list marketing actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>.

## Cold Email Strategies

[[growth_marketing_strategies for startups | Cold email]] remains a viable marketing strategy, especially for business-to-business (B2B) applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

*   **Lead Generation**:
    *   **Purchasing Lists**: Consider buying pre-existing email lists from platforms like Upwork or Fiverr for a specific niche (e.g., 10,000 agency owners for $200) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.
    *   **Scraping Tools**: Utilize tools like Apollo.io or Outscraper for B2B email data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. Outscraper is cost-effective for scraping from Google or Yellow Pages, suitable for [[marketing_strategies for local service businesses | local businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>. Find email and Findymail can scrape leads from LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.
*   **Email Sending Platforms**: Use platforms like Instantly or Smart Leads (costing $50-$100/month) to manage email campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>. These platforms often allow purchasing email addresses directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.
*   **Email Warming**: Warm up email addresses for about two weeks by sending emails to other inboxes in a warming pool. This mimics human interaction and prevents emails from being flagged as spam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.
*   **Copywriting and A/B Testing**: Write compelling copy and A/B test subject lines and calls to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>. For a tool like Invoice Nudger, a call to action might be "You don't have to talk to a single person. Here it is. Go try it out. You get your first two invoices done for free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

## [[tiktok_marketing_strategies for consumer_apps | TikTok and Instagram Playbook]]

While often associated with B2C, this playbook can be adapted for B2B apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

*   **Account Warming**: Open multiple accounts (e.g., four on TikTok, four on Instagram) and behave like a real human for 3-4 days (following, bookmarking, liking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>.
*   **Niche Immersion**: Focus on getting into your target niche (e.g., freelancer niche for Invoice Nudger) to identify working hooks, videos, and formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.
*   **Content Formats**: Experiment with formats like slideshows (e.g., "Here's the top five tools that saved my agency" featuring your app) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.

## LinkedIn Short-Form Video

LinkedIn is a powerful platform for B2B audiences, with video content performing exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

*   **Consistency is Key**: Posting short-form videos daily or every other day can lead to significant impressions and viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>.
*   **Content Ideas**: Share stories of how your app helps clients, saved your business, or use hooks like "check this tool out" or "this AI agent collects my money without breaking kneecaps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. Share screenshots from your app's dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.
*   **Link Placement**: On LinkedIn, unlike X, you can include links within posts. A common strategy is to post without a link initially, let it gain traction, then edit the post to add the link at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
*   **Embrace the Platform**: Despite some perceptions of LinkedIn being "cringe," it offers a massive pool of hundreds of millions of active users who are potential leads. Ignoring it limits your probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.

## Hand-to-Hand Combat (Direct Outreach)

This strategy involves direct, personalized outreach to a targeted list of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.

*   **Target List**: Create a list of 50-100 key individuals you want to use your tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.
*   **Enter Their Orbit**: Engage with their content on platforms like X (Twitter) by commenting on their posts to make them aware of your existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.
*   **Delayed Pitch**: Avoid immediately pitching your product in direct messages. Instead, build rapport over a longer period (e.g., a month-long play). Eventually, you can approach them with a personalized offer, such as inviting them to test your tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. This approach increases your "surface area for luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.

## Overall Advice

*   **Iterate Rapidly**: Don't get stuck on one idea. Build multiple apps in different ways to become proficient with various tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.
*   **Leverage Free Channels**: The current ecosystem allows you to spin up an MVP in an hour and then test various [[growth_marketing_strategies for startups | marketing channels]] that are often free, even generating a waitlist before extensive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.
*   **Enjoy the Process**: Building startups should be fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.

This episode promises seven [[ai_app_startups_and_ideas | AI apps]] that can be built with validated data and trending information, including distribution strategies for marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The discussed distribution hacks are current and effective, unlike outdated methods often sold in online courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Opportunity: AI for UGC Ads

One promising [[ai_app_startups_and_ideas | AI startup idea]] involves creating User-Generated Content (UGC) ads using [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | AI]] instead of real people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This opportunity is driven by a significant increase in search volume for "UGC ads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Traditionally, UGC content was used for ads, but now there's an opportunity to utilize [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | AI]] avatars and [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | AI-written scripts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. These [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | AI-generated]] creations can serve both as paid advertisements and organic social content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. A recent example showed a viral video on Twitter featuring an [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | AI-generated]] avatar speaking over screenshots to pitch a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### How to Create AI-Generated UGC Ads

The most effective approach involves a "problem-solution" storytelling style, positioning the product as the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
1.  **Initial Scripting**: A human writes the initial script, often narrating a problem and its solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. For instance, a script could describe a friend's newsletter success using a tool like Swell [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
2.  **Script Variation Generation**: Take the initial script to [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | ChatGPT]] and generate ten similar first-person variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
3.  **Avatar & Video Generation**: Use tools like HeyGen or Argil [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | AI]] to generate videos with [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | AI]] avatars using these scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. These can then be handed to a video editor with necessary assets, or even created directly within the scripting tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
4.  **Cost and Time Savings**: What previously took around five days and hundreds of dollars per 30-second clip can now be done instantly at a fraction of the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Generating ten variations, which might have cost $5,000, can now be done for significantly less, saving thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Business Models & Benefits

Two primary business models emerge from this strategy:
1.  **Agency Model**: Build an agency that creates these [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | AI-generated]] UGC ads for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Companies only need to provide background images and photos, and the agency can produce unlimited content variations for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
2.  **Product/Tool Model**: Develop a product or tool that automates this process for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

This approach offers a massive arbitrage opportunity right now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. It allows for the creation of hundreds of different ad variations at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. By running these as Facebook ads with an all-Facebook match to a conversion event, businesses can quickly identify winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

Beyond paid ads, the same content can be used for organic social media distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Posting these across multiple social accounts (e.g., using burner phones for different accounts) can generate significant organic views and go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The quality of [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | AI]] tools is now sufficient for "talking head" avatars over backdrops, mimicking news-style TikTok formats, to provide value and gain views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### The Importance of Winning Ads

Finding a winning ad is crucial for [[utilizing_ai_in_startup_growth | startup growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Many early-stage companies waste money on ads without understanding their impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. A good ad should generate a return of $5 for every $1 spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. E-commerce companies, for instance, rely on this model for their existence and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Instead of A/B testing, the strategy is A-Z testing, involving hundreds of different ad variations simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. By analyzing data, companies can identify ads with significantly lower Cost Per Click (CPC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This insight allows for further optimization by creating more variations based on common elements of successful ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The iterative process, which used to take days with human involvement, can now be done in minutes with [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Optimizing an ad from $1 per click to $0.10 per click can 10x a marketing budget's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

Platforms like Facebook are intelligent enough to identify the best ads for conversions if enough money is spent and ad variations are run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The role of the ad specialist becomes creating as many diverse ad creatives as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This new paradigm for [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | AI-powered]] ad creation allows for scale that was previously impossible without significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Current Market Landscape

This arbitrage opportunity is a massive chance for both new and established companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. While this advantage is fleeting and likely won't last beyond a year or two, it presents a window to build entire companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Making a thousand different ad variations, which once cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, can now be achieved in a weekend for around $150 through subscriptions to tools like HeyGen, [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | ChatGPT]], and Descript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This indicates that the field is still early, and substantial wealth can be generated in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Even young individuals are effectively [[utilizing_ai_in_startup_growth | utilizing AI]] in this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. The ability to create 10,000 ad variations compared to 100 significantly increases the chance of success against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

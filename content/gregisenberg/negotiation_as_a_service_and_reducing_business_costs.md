Entrepreneurs often aim to make $100,000 to $200,000 annually as a launchpad for more substantial businesses, with everything beyond that being additional profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. One key area for cost reduction and profit maximization, particularly for scaling businesses, is negotiation.

## The Importance of Negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>

Initially, many entrepreneurs might view prices as fixed, but it is often possible to secure significant discounts by asking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. Aggressive negotiation on everything from office furniture and vendor contracts to software and coffee beans can lead to substantial savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

## Challenges of Internal Negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>

As a company grows, delegating negotiation to employees becomes necessary. However, this presents several challenges:
*   **Awkwardness and Discomfort** Employees find negotiation uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.
*   **Time Consumption** Negotiations can slow down processes, sometimes taking weeks to finalize a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Incentive** Employees may not be motivated to save the company money if their bonus is only marginally affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
Training employees to negotiate often proves ineffective, even with resources like books or AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

## Negotiation as a Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>

This challenge has led to the development of "negotiation as a service" businesses. These companies handle procurement and negotiation on behalf of clients, often achieving significant savings.
*   **Tech Source** A company like Tech Source negotiates software deals for clients, including enterprise software such as Amazon S3, HubSpot, and Rippling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. They have reported savings of 60-70% for clients on their largest vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>. A similar business was previously sold to Ramp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.
*   **Broad Application** The concept can extend beyond software to virtually any major purchase, such as houses or cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. These large purchases involve substantial amounts of money and often lack clear price discovery, meaning there's significant flexibility in pricing if the right questions are asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. The actual negotiation for these items can be completed in a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

### Business Model: [[Pay for Performance Business Models | Pay for Performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>

A highly effective payment structure for a negotiation service is a [[Pay for Performance Business Models | commission-based model]], where the service earns a percentage of the savings achieved for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. For example, if a house is listed at $1 million and negotiated down to $800,000, the service could receive 20-25% of the $200,000 in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.

### Scalability and Automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>

This business model is ideal for individuals who enjoy negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. It can be scaled by training a salesforce, potentially by hiring and incentivizing individuals from regions like the Philippines or Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>. Leveraging AI tools, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), can further streamline the process, assisting negotiators with email responses and rephrasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.

This type of business is particularly relevant when companies are focused on [[automating_business_processes | reducing costs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

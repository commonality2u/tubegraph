Creating winning advertisements with artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly increase return on ad spend (ROAS) and profitability for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A key skill in achieving this is knowing how to effectively prompt AI models like [[chatgpt_4o_image_model_for_advertising | ChatGPT 4o]], a new image model, to generate desired visual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Power of Visuals with [[chatgpt_4o_image_model_for_advertising | ChatGPT 4o]]

Unlike some other image models such as Midjourney, Flux, or Ideogram, [[chatgpt_4o_image_model_for_advertising | ChatGPT 4o]] is a multimodal language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This means prompting is less critical, as the model has a strong understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The most crucial elements for creating effective ads with [[chatgpt_4o_image_model_for_advertising | ChatGPT 4o]] are the inspiration images and product images provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

The general advice for ad creation is to provide an inspiration ad that you wish to adjust or use, alongside your own custom product images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This approach allows for the creation of super consistent and reliable ads by making simple edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Examples of Ad Creation Using Reference Images

1.  **Adjusting an Existing Ad with Product Overlay**:
    *   An example involves a Jones Road Beauty ad where a provided product image is added to the top of the ad, overlapping the bottom of the original image, with a new heading and subheading below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. [[chatgpt_4o_image_model_for_advertising | GPT 4]] intelligently understands and follows these instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   This method enables [[leveraging_ai_for_ad_creation_and_iteration | experimentation at scale]] by easily swapping characters (men, female, old, young, different colors) to see what converts best for different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. [[chatgpt_4o_image_model_for_advertising | ChatGPT]] excels at [[aigenerated_ugc_ads_and_marketing | creating photorealistic images]] of diverse audiences, or you can import images from your own photoshoots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The API will eventually make it trivial to generate hundreds of ads quickly by swapping audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

2.  **Creating Ads Without Reference Images**:
    *   AI models have a strong understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands like Nike or Adidas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For such brands, you can directly prompt the AI without a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   However, for new or smaller products without significant online presence (millions of dollars in ad spend), providing a reference image is always recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
    *   When creating [[aigenerated_visuals_and_branding_opportunities | photorealistic images]], using keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" is crucial to prevent default cartoonish or oddly colored outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
    *   Detailed descriptions of the desired image are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   AI can also understand well-known font types (e.g., "exo2 bold italic"), color styles, and aspect ratios based on its training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

3.  **Remixing and Adapting Existing Ad Concepts**:
    *   An Athletic Greens example demonstrates recreating an ad from a different brand (Rise) by providing the original reference image and the new product imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Specific prompts can adjust elements like background, price, and ensure only images are generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
    *   This practice, while seemingly "dirty" due to leveraging competitors' R&D, is common in the industry through inspiration sources and templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. AI simply makes it more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

4.  **Changing the Concept of an Existing Ad**:
    *   A Ridge Wallet ad, originally a Black Friday promotion, was transformed into a Christmas-style ad by swapping the product color and changing the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Simple prompts are effective because reference images convey a lot of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
    *   This capability allows for tailoring ads to major holidays (Christmas, New Year's, Valentine's Day) or even niche ones (National Hot Dog Day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. It also opens doors for highly personalized targeting, such as birthday promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
    *   The future of advertising will involve more personal, funny, and entertaining ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. [[aigenerated_visuals_and_branding_opportunities | AI]] enables companies to capitalize on real-time news cycles or viral moments, creating relevant ads quickly and affordably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

## Where to Find Ad Inspiration

Several platforms offer ad inspiration and templating tools:
*   Creative OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>
*   Forplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   Icon.me (which aggregates and tags Meta Ad Library content for easy searching) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>
*   [[Exploring Style References and Aesthetics | Sora]] (has an explore page showing prompts for images, useful for ideation and understanding prompt structures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. [[Exploring Style References and Aesthetics | Sora]] is also noted for less strict policy guidelines and potentially better photorealism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Prompting and Iteration Strategies

When working with AI for ads:
*   **Clarity and Directness**: Be very clear and direct in what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **New Chat for Adjustments**: If the initial prompt doesn't yield the desired result, start a new chat for adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This prevents the AI from continually referencing a flawed, previously [[aigenerated_visuals_and_branding_opportunities | AI-generated image]], which can lead to degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Temperature**: AI models have a "temperature" concept, which is the amount of randomness in outputs given the same input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. For image generation, the temperature is often low, meaning similar prompts usually lead to similar responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
*   **Dimensions**: AI usually defaults to a 9:16 aspect ratio, but you can specify desired dimensions like 1:1 or 9:16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

### Live Example: LCA Design Agency Ad

In a live demonstration for LCA, a design agency for the AI age, the process involved:
1.  **Gathering Images**: Screenshots of the company logo, client brands (Dropbox, Salesforce), and website copy were taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. A vintage Rolex ad was used as an inspiration image for a "luxury" vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.
2.  **Initial Prompting**: The prompt included instructions to "generate a digital ad for LCA," described as a "SWAT team design agency for the most interesting brands on the planet helping them with building AI first products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. Screenshots were provided as inspiration, and the vintage Rolex ad was referenced to capture a "luxury feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.
3.  **Challenges and Adjustments**:
    *   Initial challenges included potential language confusion (requiring specification to write in English) and low-resolution text in screenshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
    *   The first generated ad included a Rolex watch, indicating the AI interpreted the reference ad too literally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.
    *   To adjust, a new chat was started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. The prompt was refined to say "rather than generating a watch show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
    *   The subsequent output successfully incorporated client logos (though it hallucinated one, Disney) and maintained the desired luxury aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. The AI also retained the overall vibe and typography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.
4.  **Refining Outputs**: Once an initial concept is generated, further specific prompts can guide the AI to exact desired outcomes, such as man's pose, precise logo inclusion, or text placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

### From Image to Video Content

While generating images, it's also possible to animate them into video content using tools like Runway and [[Exploring Style References and Aesthetics | Sora]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>. This allows for adapting AI-generated visuals for various ad platforms that prioritize video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>.

The ability to create high-quality, creative ads and memes rapidly marks an incredible time for marketers to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

Brett from Designjoy, a one-man designer, generates millions of dollars annually by utilizing AI to create impressive designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00"></a>. He emphasizes that the path to generating beautiful graphics with AI is "super easy," surprising many with its simplicity and lack of hidden complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39"></a>.

## Democratizing Design with AI

AI tools are making high-quality design accessible even to non-designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08"></a>. While having "good taste" helps, prior design knowledge is not required to create significant value using these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22"></a>. The goal is to enable anyone, even non-creatives, to produce stunning visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34"></a>.

### Key AI Tools for Design

Various generative AI tools are available, covering image generation, video generation, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44"></a>. The primary tools for effective AI design include:

*   **Higsfield:** An excellent starting point for beginners with no experience, offering pre-set templates that simplify the process of telling AI what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44"></a>. Users can select a preset, upload a product picture, and generate content quickly, even maintaining text on products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56"></a>. It's useful for creating cool ads for social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02"></a>.
*   **Midjourney:** Ideal for artistic styling and generating images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46"></a>. It excels at creating artistic images with specific styles, colors, shadows, highlights, and depth of field through image and style references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21"></a>.
*   **ChatGPT:** Crucial for constructing effective prompts, as the quality of AI-generated content relies heavily on the input prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34"></a>. ChatGPT can take simple ideas and expand them into rich, detailed prompts, effectively making prompting no longer a complex skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43"></a>.
*   **Runway:** Used to add motion and turn static images into videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45"></a>. It understands specific movements described in prompts, generated by ChatGPT, and can upscale videos to 4K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27"></a>.
*   **Cling:** Another image-to-video tool that allows for looping videos by setting the start and end frames to be identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48"></a>. It also offers AI-generated sound options based on video context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57"></a>.
*   **Photoshop (Generative Fill) & Magnific Upscaler:** Used for further refining and enhancing details of AI-generated images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55"></a>.
*   **Cap Cut:** A user-friendly video platform for simple editing tasks like adding text layers to generated videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54"></a>.

### Workflow for AI-Powered Design

The process typically involves:
1.  **Idea Generation:** Start with a basic idea of what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01"></a>.
2.  **Prompt Creation:** Use ChatGPT to generate detailed prompts for your desired image or video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04"></a>. ChatGPT can also generate collections of related scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18"></a>.
3.  **Image Generation:** Plug the prompt into Midjourney (or similar tools) to create the base image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11"></a>. Pinterest can be used to find stylistic directions and reference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26"></a>.
4.  **Add Motion (Optional):** Upload the image to Runway or Cling, and use a ChatGPT-generated prompt to describe the desired movement for video creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57"></a>.
5.  **Refinement:** Utilize tools like Photoshop for generative fill, Magnific Upscaler for detail, or Cap Cut for adding text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50"></a>.
6.  **Continuous Content:** Save the last frame of a video as an image to use as the starting frame for a new video, creating a continuous shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14"></a>.

This integrated approach allows for the creation of complex, multi-scene videos quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08"></a>.

## Startup Opportunities with AI Design

> [!NOTE] Current Capabilities and Future Potential
> While AI for design is advancing rapidly, it's "far from perfect" and can sometimes produce unexpected results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22"></a>. Users may need to adjust prompts and re-generate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52"></a>. Website design output from AI tools is currently "pretty mediocre" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05"></a>. AI is also not currently good at logo design, generating entire brands, or creating vector art, meaning a human designer is still needed for certain elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29"></a>.

The biggest opportunity for startups using AI in design lies in **branding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50"></a>. AI enables the quick and consistent generation of assets that maintain a cohesive brand identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57"></a>. By setting up a "mood board" in Midjourney with a consistent code, new content can reference back to a defined style, ensuring continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46"></a>. This allows for rapid replication of creatives, making it a "creative person's dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30"></a>.

Other areas of opportunity include:
*   **Rapid Prototyping and Testing:** [[developing_and_testing_startup_ideas_using_ai_tools | AI tools]] can accelerate the visual development and testing of startup ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44"></a>.

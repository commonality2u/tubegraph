This article outlines strategies for using AI, specifically Google V3 and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, to create compelling content, build a brand, and generate income. PJ, a creator known for viral AI films, shares his process and monetization insights. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>

## The Core Opportunity: Understanding Engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
While AI makes content creation incredibly easy, the abundance of content means the key is understanding *why* people engage, watch, and share content. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a> The ability to create entertaining content that resonates with an audience is more important than technical skill. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

## AI Content Creation Process
The process involves several stages, from ideation to final editing and distribution.

### 1. Ideation and Scripting
The starting point is a unique idea or "hook" that makes content unexpected. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> PJ used a pharmaceutical commercial parody as an example, where the twist was a pill that attracts puppies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>

*   **Initial Prompts with LLMs**: Start with generalized instructions to get a clich√© script, then iterate by tearing it apart. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
*   **Leveraging Satire and Style**: Instruct the LLM to use a specific style, such as "SNL style satirical take" or to "create jokes in the style of Seth Rogan" or "imagine your Bill Burr doing a standup comedy routine." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>
*   **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously re-feed preferred lines and directions to the LLM to refine the script and generate "zingers" or one-liners. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a> Approximately 70% of the lines in PJ's viral ad were generated this way. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>
*   **Using Multiple LLMs**: Experiment with different models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok (especially Grok's unhinged mode) for diverse outputs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>

### 2. Prompting for Visuals with Google V3
Once the script is finalized, each dialogue line is converted into a visual prompt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>

*   **Simple Prompts**: V3 does not require overly complicated prompts; a description of the scene and dialogue is often sufficient. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>
*   **Character Description**: Describe characters in detail to maintain visual consistency across shots, though perfect consistency is not yet guaranteed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>
*   **Camera Movements and Emotion**: Incorporate camera movements (e.g., "camera push in" or "dolly in") and character emotions into prompts to make shots feel more dynamic and less AI-generated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>
*   **Audio Generation**: V3 can generate audio, but it may sound thin or lack voice consistency. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a> Avoid quotes in prompts to reduce gibberish subtitles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>
*   **Cost Management**: V3 costs $2-$3 per shot, so run prompts one at a time to get feedback and avoid unnecessary expenses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a> It cost PJ about $500 to create his viral pharmaceutical commercial. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>

### 3. Editing and Post-Production
*   **Software**: Stitch clips together using editing software. Popular options include Final Cut Pro, CapCut, or DaVinci Resolve (a free, top-tier option). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>
*   **Shot Selection**: Expect a low ratio of good generations. PJ had a 5:1 bad to good ratio for his ad. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>

## Distribution and Hook Strategy
The content hook is as vital as the video itself for going viral. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>

*   **The Mr. Beast Funnel**: On platforms like X, the headline is crucial to get viewers to watch the video, and the first few seconds of the video are critical to keep them engaged. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>
*   **Provocative Headlines**: Use provocative statements or questions that create intrigue and drive engagement. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>
    *   **Example**: "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials. I made this for $500 in V3 credits in less than a day. What's the argument for spending 500K now? Steal my prompt below." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a> This headline combines a "low-key flex," trend-jacking, cost comparison, a question to drive replies, and a call to action. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>
*   **Trend-jacking**: Capitalize on trending topics or technologies, like V3. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>
*   **Authenticity**: While some common viral phrases work, finding unique language is key to building an authentic brand. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>

## [[marketing_and_monetization_strategies_for_ai_products | Marketing and Monetization Strategies for AI Products]]

There are numerous [[opportunities_in_aienhanced_branding | opportunities in AI-enhanced branding]] and [[leveraging_ai_for_marketing_strategies | leveraging AI for marketing strategies]] to build a business around generative AI.

### 1. Build a Personal Brand with V3
Use AI-generated content to build a strong personal brand, leading to downstream opportunities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a> An audience is a valuable asset. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>

### 2. Attract Direct Clients
Create commercials for specific niches or industries and pitch them directly to companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>
*   **Examples**: Food products (beer, CPG brands like Feastables), underwear brands. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>
*   **Pricing**: Charge competitive rates (e.g., $5,000 minimum) for your skill as a filmmaker, even if the AI production cost is low. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>

### 3. Build a Portfolio for Agencies
Create a portfolio of AI-generated commercials. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>
*   **Niche Down**: Specialize in content for a specific niche (e.g., knife commercials) that interests you. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>
*   **Learn from the Best**: "Good artists copy, great artists steal." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a> Take screenshots of award-winning commercials, use ChatGPT to break them down into prompts, and recreate them with V3. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a> Apply the spirit of these commercials to adjacent products to build skills without direct rip-offs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>

### 4. Create Narrative Series with Brand Integrations
Develop a narrative series and integrate brands directly into the story, similar to Neural Viz's "moniverse" where aliens interact with human artifacts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>
*   **Monetization**: This can lead to merch sales, Patreon subscriptions, or lucrative product integration deals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>
*   **Strategy**: Find popular social formats (e.g., "Man on the Street" or "House Hunters") and add a unique twist (e.g., aliens). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>

### 5. Sell Courses or Digital Products
Monetize your knowledge by selling courses, PDFs, or other digital products on how to use AI for content creation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>

### 6. Consulting for Larger Companies
Offer consulting services to Fortune 500 companies on integrating generative AI into their content strategies, including legal and compliance considerations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a> Charge based on the scale of the company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>

### 7. Build a Sketch Comedy Channel
Create a Key & Peele-style sketch comedy show. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a> While harder to monetize directly, large audiences can attract brand integrations (e.g., Bang Energy drinks on TikTok). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>

### 8. Narrative Films (with Caveats)
While possible, creating long-form narrative films (e.g., 90-minute features) with generative AI is not currently recommended due to rapid iteration in the AI space and potential for inconsistent quality. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>
*   **Focus on Episodic Content**: Prioritize weekly or episodic content, as it aligns better with current consumption habits and the creator economy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>

### 9. Pitch Brands on Narrative Content
Offer to create bespoke narrative series for brands, where their products are seamlessly integrated as "relics and artifacts" within a unique universe. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>

### 10. Target Small Sub-Niches
Identify underserved niches with high demand and low content supply. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>
*   **Examples**: Bible content (open-sourced IP, 2 billion daily active users), <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a> BookTok (romantic series, book promos for authors). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a> This opens doors to vertical niches that couldn't afford traditional cinematography. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>

## Key Takeaways
*   **Do What Fascinates You**: Lean into your unique interests and "weirdness" to find your niche. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>
*   **Copy Frameworks**: Replicate successful content frameworks and apply them to new, unique niches. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>
*   **Focus on Hooks**: Prioritize compelling headlines and initial content moments to capture audience attention. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>
*   **Monetize Content Creation**: There are many [[using_ai_for_business_growth_and_marketing | business growth and marketing]] opportunities by [[leveraging_ai_for_marketing_and_growth | leveraging AI for marketing and growth]] and creating content for brands or building your own brand. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>

This article compares the pricing and subscription plans of OpenAI's ChatGPT Deep Research and Perplexity's Deep Research, two AI tools designed for in-depth analysis and business idea generation.

## OpenAI ChatGPT Deep Research

OpenAI's ChatGPT offers a Pro Plan that includes its Deep Research feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The cost for this plan is stated as $200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. ChatGPT Deep Research is noted for providing more in-depth reports and answers, though it can take longer to generate responses compared to Perplexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

It is suggested that users might need to prompt ChatGPT multiple times (e.g., five or seven times) to get the desired level of detail, but this is still significantly fewer prompts than using regular ChatGPT (which might require 50 to 100 prompts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

## Perplexity Deep Research

Perplexity's Deep Research feature is available for $20 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
A free tier is also available, allowing users to utilize Deep Research a few times per month without a subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

Perplexity is highlighted for its speed in generating responses, often completing research faster than ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. While its initial answers may be less verbose than ChatGPT's, they are described as "no fluff" and direct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. Users might need to engage in more follow-up prompting to achieve the desired depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

## Comparison and Value

When comparing the two, ChatGPT Pro is approximately ten times the price of Perplexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. The choice between them depends on user preference: Perplexity offers quicker, more concise answers that may require additional prompts, while ChatGPT provides more comprehensive, in-depth reports at a slower pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

Both services are considered "insanely good" and offer a significant [[using_ai_tools_for_business_growth | unfair advantage]] in tasks like [[building_and_launching_an_ai_saas_business | building a zero-to-one startup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>. Users are encouraged to experiment with both to determine which best suits their workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.

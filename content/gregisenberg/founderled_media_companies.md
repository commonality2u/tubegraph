Founder-led media companies represent a new business model where individuals build an audience through content creation, which then serves as a foundation for launching and scaling other products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This approach is changing the dynamic of how businesses function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Benefits of Owned Media
Having owned media, such as a YouTube channel or podcast, allows founders to attract people interested in the same topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This creates a platform where creators have "rails" to put whatever content they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
Key advantages include:
*   **Location Independence** A YouTube channel or podcast eliminates the need to live in major cities like New York City or San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Product and Service Creation** An audience provides a base for creating and selling products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Financial Leverage** Younger generations are "printing money" on YouTube, using it as a subsidy to build [[building_and_scaling_tech_startups | productized services]] and SaaS companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This is a new way to do business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Deep Trust and Inbound Generation** Media channels enable founders to build deep trust in a one-to-many format, generating inbound leads for their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.
*   **Global Reach** Anyone globally can build an audience and gain leverage by sharing good ideas regularly and at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.
*   **Monetization** YouTube, in particular, offers strong monetization opportunities through ad revenue, allowing content to subsidize the cost of audience building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.
*   **Resilience** Having an owned distribution channel like an email list provides "schmuck insurance" against dependence on any single platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

## Building a Founder-led Media Company

### Leveraging Platform Trends
A key strategy is to identify and attach to larger platform trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Instead of trying to educate the market, focus on selling what people already want to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

#### LinkedIn Video Growth
LinkedIn is rolling out a "for you page" feed similar to TikTok, creating a "blue ocean" for video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This presents a massive opportunity for founders to build personal brands and generate inbound leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Service for Founders:** A company could help founders create LinkedIn video content by interviewing them, scripting content based on conversations, and providing guidance on recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This service could also include clip creation and scheduling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
    *   This "done-for-you" solution requires minimal founder time (2-3 hours per week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
    *   Additional services could include lead magnets (e.g., drip courses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a> and design help (e.g., banners, infographics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Marketing Strategy:** Build your own channel on LinkedIn by making clips and posting them, then invite others to "book an intro call" for your services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Creating a community for founders trying to grow on LinkedIn can serve as a top-of-funnel strategy, with services offered as an upsell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
    *   An example strategy: "FoundersGoingViralOnLinkedIn.com" offering weekly tips, founder breakdowns, and monthly calls, with a "done-for-you" service upsell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **VC as a Customer:** Venture Capital (VC) firms are increasingly interested in media to attract the best founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. A service could target VCs by offering to create content for their portfolio companies, positioning it as a value-add for deal flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Many VCs want to be famous and are spinning out podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

#### Newsletter Services
Founders often want newsletters but don't want to write them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   **Done-for-you Newsletter Service:** Interview founders for an hour, convert the transcript into a newsletter using [[ai_startups_and_business_ideas | AI]] tools for tone and style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.
*   **Audience Growth:** Use tools like SalesQL to scrape emails from Twitter and LinkedIn followers, validate them, and sequence them into the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. Automate DMs to new followers on social platforms to promote newsletter subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition:** Founders view this as a return on audience spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>, as it helps convert social followers into owned email subscribers, building deeper relationships with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

#### YouTube Thumbnail and Title Library
With YouTube dominating the creator space due to its monetization capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>, there's an opportunity for a subscription-based service providing a library of plug-and-play YouTube thumbnails and titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
*   **Go-to-Market:** Scrape YouTube email addresses of channels with over 10,000 subscribers in specific categories/countries, and cold email them access to the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Optimization:** Integrate data from tools like VidIQ to show the probability of titles and thumbnails generating more traffic, views, and impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
*   **Trend Analysis:** Incorporate time-based trends to help creators cycle through formats and avoid audience fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **AI Augmentation:** Use AI to augment the ability to find and remix successful thumbnail and title variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.

## Key Principles for Founder-led Media

*   **Consistency is Key:** Content creation is a grind, but consistent effort is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   **Define Your Voice:** Spend time figuring out your tone, voice, personality, style, and content format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.
*   **Be a Conductor, Not Just a Player:** Focus on curating and editing content, and building systems that allow you to bring in a pipeline of ideas and leverage teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **Founder Energy in Early Days:** Initial founder energy is needed to "break the laws of physics" and get a company into orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   **"Get out of your business and on top of it"**: Once in orbit, delegate as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **Ungatekeep Knowledge:** Sharing information publicly attracts interested people and builds reputation, knowledge, and leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.
*   **Niche Down:** Focusing on specific, underserved niches, even unsexy ones, can lead to significant influence and income with a smaller but highly engaged audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>.
*   **Be Yourself:** Authenticity resonates with audiences and creates a more sustainable approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>.
*   **Create Digital Gravity:** Building media is about creating "digital mass" on the internet to generate "digital gravity," leading to greater serendipity and inbound opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

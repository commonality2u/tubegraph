Creating winning advertisements and visual content with AI, specifically [[prompting_techniques_for_chatgpt_4o | ChatGPT 4o]], can significantly increase return on ad spend (ROAS) and business profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This powerful image model allows for the rapid generation of "banging ads" in as little as two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## ChatGPT 4o: An Advanced Image Model

Unlike pure image models such as [[the_integration_of_midjourney_and_chatgpt_in_design | Midjourney]] or Ideogram, [[chat_gpt_and_ai_training | ChatGPT 4o]] is a multimodal language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This means it has a superior understanding of intent and creativity, making prompting less critical than for other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Key Factors for Effective Ad Generation

The most crucial elements for creating successful ads with [[chat_gpt_and_ai_training | ChatGPT 4o]] are:
*   **Inspiration Images:** Providing an existing ad or design you want to adjust or use as a basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Product Images:** Supplying your own custom images of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Prompting Techniques for ChatGPT 4o

While prompting is less critical than with pure image models, specific [[prompting_techniques_for_chatgpt_4o | prompting techniques for ChatGPT 4o]] enhance results:
*   **Straightforward Instructions:** [[chat_gpt_and_ai_training | ChatGPT 4o]] has a strong understanding of intent, allowing for basic and direct prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Using Keywords for Realism:** Include "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to ensure images don't default to cartoonish styles or strange colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Well-Known Concepts:** The model has a good understanding of well-known brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas) and concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. For newer or smaller products, always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Font and Style Specifications:** For well-known fonts, the model can decent representations. Users can also specify color styles and aspect ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Text Generation:** Include "generate the image" to prevent the model from trying to generate text that represents the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Starting New Chats for Adjustments:** If an initial prompt doesn't yield desired results, start a new chat for adjustments rather than continuing in the same conversation. This prevents the model from using flawed generated images as its reference, which can lead to a "recycle of worse and worse" outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The images will remain consistent enough with improvements from the new prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

## Applications and Examples

[[developing_unique_and_entertaining_content_with_ai_insights | Developing unique and entertaining content with AI insights]] allows for varied applications:

### Recreating Ads with Custom Imagery
By providing an inspiration ad (e.g., Jones Road Beauty ad) and a custom product image, [[chat_gpt_and_ai_training | ChatGPT 4o]] can accurately combine them, following instructions like overlaying product images and placing headings/subheadings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This allows for creating consistent and reliable ads by making minor edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Generating Ads Without Reference Images
For well-known brands like Adidas, a detailed text prompt describing the desired image (e.g., a female runner in the Egyptian desert with pyramids) is sufficient to generate creative ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Changing Concepts of Existing Ads
Users can swap elements (e.g., product images) and change the concept of an ad (e.g., from a Black Friday ad to a Christmas style ad) using simple prompts, leveraging the "picture is worth a thousand words" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

### Targeting and Experimentation at Scale
AI enables [[developing_unique_and_entertaining_content_with_ai_insights | developing unique and entertaining content with AI insights]] by generating numerous variations of ads with different demographics (men, women, old, young, diverse colors) to see what converts best for different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This allows for rapid experimentation at scale, identifying subtle differences (e.g., a woman looking left vs. right, blonde vs. red hair) that can significantly impact ROAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The saying "the ad is the targeting" is now achievable at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Capitalizing on Current Events
Companies can now rapidly create ads that take advantage of short-term news cycles or trending moments, which was previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. AI could even be set up to monitor news feeds (e.g., Twitter) and automatically generate relevant ads on mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## Finding Ad Inspiration

To find ad inspiration and templates, users can explore platforms that read and tag the Meta Ad Library, making them easily searchable:
*   **Creative OS:** Offers inspiration and templating tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **ForPlay** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   **Icon.me:** A recently launched tool that has become a staple for ad building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   **Sora's Explore Page:** A highly recommended resource that uses the same underlying model as [[chat_gpt_and_ai_training | ChatGPT 4o]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. It's a great way to understand effective prompts, get ideation, and see how others are prompting. Clicking on any image reveals its prompt, which can then be adjusted or remixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Sora is also noted for having less strict policy guidelines and being better at photo realism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Live Ad Creation Example (LCA Design Agency)

A live demonstration showed the process of creating an ad for LCA (Late Checkout Agency), a design agency for the AI age working with top brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

### Initial Setup
1.  **Identify Key Brand Elements:** This includes logos, typography (bolding, italics), color schemes, and client brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Screenshots of these elements were taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
2.  **Choose Inspiration:** A vintage Rolex ad was selected for its luxury aesthetic, aligning with LCA's high-end service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
3.  **Initial Prompting:** Images (brand elements, inspiration ad) were uploaded to [[chat_gpt_and_ai_training | ChatGPT 4o]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>. The prompt included:
    *   Basic instruction: "Generate a digital ad for LCA." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>
    *   Contextual description of LCA: "a SWAT team design agency only for the most interesting brands on the planet helping them with building AI first tools. It only works with the best companies." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>
    *   Image usage instruction: "I have provided some screenshots from their website for you to use as inspiration in the ad as well as a reference vintage Rolex ad as inspiration. Use this to capture the luxury vibe of the company." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>
    *   Final instruction: "Generate the image." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>
    *   It's important to prompt specifically for English text if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

### First Generation Results and Iteration
The first attempt resulted in an ad featuring the selected man and background, with "LCA" and relevant copy, but also included a Rolex watch, indicating the model misinterpreted the "Rolex ad" as a product to include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.

To refine, a **new chat** was started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>. The prompt was adjusted to specify: "rather than generating a watch, show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

### Second Generation Results
The second attempt successfully removed the Rolex watch and incorporated logos of companies LCA works with. It maintained the overall aesthetic and copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. The man in the image was also slightly different, showing his wrist instead of pointing, demonstrating the model's subtle variations even with similar prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

### Refinement Principles
*   **Specific Instructions:** Once an initial idea is generated, more specific prompts can guide the AI to exact desired outcomes (e.g., "man is pointing," "include all of these logos by name," "text on the side") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.
*   **Consistency (Low Temperature):** The "temperature" of LLMs refers to the amount of randomness. These models generally have low temperature, meaning similar prompts yield similar responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratio:** By default, [[chat_gpt_and_ai_training | ChatGPT 4o]] often generates 9x16 images, but users can specify other dimensions like 1x1 or 9x16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

## The Future of AI in Content Creation

The accessibility of tools like [[chat_gpt_and_ai_training | ChatGPT 4o]] means that creating personal, funny, and entertaining ads is now easier than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. The ability to generate images quickly and iterate allows for more [[efficient_use_of_ai_tools_like_chatgpt_and_cursor_ai | efficient use of AI tools like ChatGPT and Cursor AI]] and opens opportunities for [[monetizing_generative_ai_content | monetizing generative AI content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

The API for [[chat_gpt_and_ai_training | ChatGPT 4o]] will eventually become generally available, making it trivial to generate hundreds of ads in minutes by simply feeding inspiration and audience variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

While direct [[video_generation_and_editing_using_ai | video generation and editing using AI]] from these images is still developing, animation of generated ads is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>. Tools like Runway and Sora are recommended for [[video_generation_and_editing_using_ai | video generation and editing using AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>. This marks an incredible time to create memes, ads, and other creative content to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.

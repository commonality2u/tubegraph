From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

[[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] is considered a new medium entirely, offering a different type of canvas and problem-solving approach for artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It allows for blending and balancing entire aesthetics, leading to complex and harmonious results that can be infinitely prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Getting Started with Midjourney Web App

For optimal use, it is recommended to move from Discord to the [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] web application at `midjourney.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The web app offers a more user-friendly experience for creation and exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Exploring and Inspiration

The "Explore" tab on the [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] web app displays all publicly available generations, serving as a vast library for inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Users can search for specific styles, such as "vintage poster," and use a search icon to find similar results based on subject matter and style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Options available for existing images include:
*   **"Use prompt"**: Copies the original text prompt into the user's prompt bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **"Use style"**: Imports the image as a [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | style reference]] (indicated by a paperclip icon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **"Use as an image"**: Imports the image as an image prompt (indicated by a pict icon), which functions differently from a [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | style reference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

All images in the "Explore" tab are generated within [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Privacy and Client Work

For client work or sensitive imagery, it is crucial to use the Pro Plan or above and enable "stealth mode" to prevent assets from showing up in the public database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Stealth mode can be toggled in the settings on the right side of the prompt bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Benefits of Midjourney

[[use_of_ai_tools_for_design_and_branding | Midjourney]] serves multiple purposes:
*   **Inspiration Tool**: Great for quickly generating ideas and building mood boards, offering more control than traditional image searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Production**: The new editor feature allows for modifying existing assets, such as out-painting and adding new elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Discovery Engine**: An effective way to explore aesthetics by generating ideas and following creative rabbit holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Creative Control**: Provides significant creative control over the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Blending Aesthetics: Style References vs. Image Prompts

When [[exploring_aigenerated_art_beyond_text_prompting | creating AI-generated art]], understanding the difference between image prompts and [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | style references]] is key to [[leveraging_ai_to_enhance_creativity_and_productivity | enhancing creativity]] and achieving desired aesthetic outcomes.

### Style References

*   **Mechanism**: A [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | style reference]] (paperclip icon) instructs [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] to decouple the aesthetic qualities from the subject matter of the input image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. It understands what makes the image's style unique (e.g., colors, composition, lighting, texture, pattern) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.
*   **Application**: When used with a subject prompt, [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] tries to integrate the learned aesthetic elements into the new generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **`--sw` (Style Weight) Parameter**: Controls the influence of the [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | style reference]] on the generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The default is 100, and it can go up to 1000 for stronger influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **Combining with Text**: A detailed text prompt (e.g., "a paper cutout illustration") can provide additional support and guidance for the desired style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

### Image Prompts

*   **Mechanism**: An image prompt (pict icon) attempts to pull in more of the subject matter and actual pixels from the input image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
*   **Effect**: This can lead to unexpected results, such as the subject of the input image appearing in the new generation (e.g., a hand-giraffe when using a hand image as an image prompt with a giraffe text prompt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Distinction is critical: Dragging an image by default sets it as an image prompt, but clicking the paperclip icon changes it to a style reference, which is often what is intended for aesthetic transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

### Balancing Elements

The core of [[exploring_aigenerated_art_beyond_text_prompting | AI-generated art]] with [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] is finding balance and harmony between various "aesthetic levers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>:
*   [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | Style references]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>
*   Text prompts (including medium descriptions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>
*   [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | Parameters]] like style weight (`--sw`) and aspect ratio (`--ar`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>

## Personalization and Style Blending

[[using_ai_in_content_creation | Midjourney]] allows for deep personalization of the model to align with individual aesthetic preferences.

### Personalization Feature

*   **How it Works**: Users can teach [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] their preferences by rating images in the "Personalize" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. This process helps the AI learn preferred colors, lighting, general style (photographic vs. illustrative), and even specific subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Personalization fine-tunes the model, leading to significantly different aesthetics compared to the community-curated default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. It is highly recommended to rate at least a thousand images for best results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

### `--s` (Stylize) Parameter

The `--s` (stylize) [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | parameter]] determines how much of the [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] model's curated aesthetics are applied to the text prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
*   **High Stylize Values**: Tend to produce images that "scream AI" or strongly reflect [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]]'s default aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.
*   **With Personalization**: When personalization is active, high stylize values will emphasize the user's fine-tuned aesthetic preferences instead of the default model's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

### Blending Personalization and Styles

Users can blend their personalization with multiple [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | style references]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. This involves:
*   Combining different [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | style references]] (images or SRF codes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.
*   Adjusting the weight of each component (e.g., using `::2` syntax for weighted blending) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.
*   Incorporating personal aesthetic preferences through the stylize parameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a>.

## Style Reference Codes (SRF)

Style reference codes (SRF) are like "coordinates in a multi-dimensional style space" that direct [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] to a specific aesthetic location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.
*   **Function**: Any prompt used with an SRF code will be influenced by the aesthetics of that specific "universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.
*   **Exploration**: Tools like a "style reference explorer" exist to visually search and discover SRF codes based on style, vibe, or theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.
*   **Blending SRFs**: Multiple SRF codes can be combined in a prompt to blend their unique aesthetic characteristics like different "paints on a palette" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>.

## Practical Application: The Giraffe Example

The process of [[exploring_aigenerated_art_beyond_text_prompting | creating AI-generated art]] was demonstrated through a giraffe example, starting with inspiration from old posters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Iterative Design Process

1.  **Initial Style Reference**: An image of a Tokyo Trade Fair poster (simple, minimalist, paper cutout style with bold colors) was used as a starting [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | style reference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
2.  **Basic Prompt**: A simple subject, "giraffe," was used to observe how [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] interpreted the [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | style reference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
3.  **Adjusting Style Weight**: The `--sw` (style weight) parameter was increased to lean more heavily into the illustrative look of the [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | style reference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
4.  **Adding Text Prompt Detail**: Descriptive text like "a paper cutout illustration of a giraffe" was added to further guide the aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
5.  **Aspect Ratio**: The `--ar` (aspect ratio) parameter was adjusted to `2:3` to achieve a poster-like layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
6.  **Swapping Style References**: Different posters were used as [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | style references]] to explore varied aesthetic directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.
7.  **Variations**: Subtle and strong variations (buttons found below generated images) were used to explore different compositions while maintaining the general vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
8.  **Editor Feature**: The in-app editor was used to paint out unwanted elements, such as text, from the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. The `--no` parameter can also be used to explicitly tell [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] what to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.
9.  **Blending SRF Codes**: Multiple SRF codes were combined to create unique stylistic blends, such as mixing "paper cutout" with "glazed ceramic" aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
10. **Parameter Permutation Prompts**: Brackets and commas `[value1, value2]` were used in the prompt to test multiple parameter values (e.g., style weights) in a single run, allowing for quick visual comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

## Future of AI Art and Manifesting Latent Space

The goal is to physically manifest latent space, bringing [[exploring_aigenerated_art_beyond_text_prompting | AI-generated art]] to life beyond the digital realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. A lab is being built to provide equipment like robots for painting and music, 3D printers, and editing stations to transform digital creations into physical and animated forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. The ultimate aim is to see [[exploring_aigenerated_art_beyond_text_text_prompting | AI-generated art]] displayed in museums like the MoMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

### Tips for Users

*   **Organize Favorites**: Like generated images by clicking the heart icon or right-clicking to make them easier to find later in the "Organize" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.
*   **Shortcut**: After hitting enter, press the up arrow on the keyboard to repopulate the last prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.
*   **Guided Decisions**: Focus on visually analyzing results and making informed decisions about adjustments rather than relying on a "slot machine game" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.

> [!NOTE] This approach transforms [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] from a text-based tool to a visual canvas, allowing for complex blending and problem-solving to achieve unique aesthetic outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.

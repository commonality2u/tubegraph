Steph Smith, described as the "queen of trends" and "queen of ideas," shares insights on [[ai_startup_ideas_and_frameworks | AI startup ideas and frameworks]] and entrepreneurship, focusing on both AI-specific ventures and tech-agnostic concepts in a rapidly changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The goal of the discussion is to provide a framework for thinking about this "barbelled world" and offer new startup ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Startup Giveaway
> A $5,000 giveaway was announced to help one person build their [[startup_empire_and_entrepreneurship | startup idea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. To enter, individuals must like the YouTube video, comment on what startup idea they would build with $5,000, subscribe to the YouTube channel, and reply to Greg Eisenberg's newsletter stating "I want to win the giveaway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The giveaway is sponsored by Beehive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Modern Entrepreneurial Thinking

The current environment necessitates a re-evaluation of online presence and marketing strategies. What worked for marketing on the web in 2010 is "out the door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. There's a need for differentiation beyond standard landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

### Personal Websites and Lead Generation
It is highly recommended for individuals to have a personal website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Creating a custom website, rather than using standard website creators like Squarespace, allows for a unique representation of oneself and helps differentiate creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

A key opportunity exists for personal webpages to incorporate "knowledge open pages" that act as lead magnets, allowing creators to capture email addresses and maintain direct connection with their audience, irrespective of social media algorithm changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. People are more willing to provide their email for valuable content rather than just a newsletter subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## AIdriven Startup Ideas

Several ideas for [[ai_startup_ideas_and_frameworks | AI startup ideas and frameworks]] were discussed, leveraging AI and current technological capabilities.

### 1. Open Page Creator
This idea involves creating a platform that allows users to build highly customizable "open pages" to display personal statistics, similar to how startups share revenue or user stats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

*   **Concept:** Move beyond just business metrics to personal life stats, such as books read, exercise progress, supplement intake, or glucose monitor readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Users would control what data they display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Technology & Ease of Use:** The technology now allows almost anyone to "whip up a page" using tools like Cursor or Bolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. An example shared is a surfing stats page built with Cursor by someone with no prior coding experience, featuring dynamic animations and trackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This represents a significant shift from the past difficulty of creating such pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Motivation:** These pages tap into the human desire for social motivation and leaderboards, similar to platforms like Strava <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. An "open page" for sobriety, tracking days sober, was also suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Monetization:** A freemium model could be implemented, offering a simple free page and upcharging for additional modules and customization. This could include specialized features for fitness influencers (e.g., displaying affiliations with supplement brands like Thorne) or improved integrations (e.g., better Strava embeds for runners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Such a platform could also serve as a more creative "link page" with monetization opportunities through sponsored sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Domain Idea:** OpenPages.me is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### 2. Integrated Health Platform
A request for a centralized, [[datadriven_startup_opportunities | data-driven]] platform that integrates all personal health information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

*   **Concept:** Aggregate data from continuous glucose monitors (CGM), Strava, blood tests (e.g., Function Health), and medication records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **AI Layer:** Implement an AI layer, similar to ChatGPT, that can triangulate data, offer suggestions, and allow users to "probe" it with health-related questions (e.g., "Could this medication be causing my nausea given my marathon heart rate data?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. This digital doctor layer would not prescribe but act as an interrogatable assistant, integrating information from the web in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Technical Feasibility:** APIs for devices like Dexcom, Abbott (CGM), and Strava already exist, allowing data integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   **Monetization:** Users would likely pay a substantial subscription fee (e.g., $30+ per month), especially if it helps solve health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. It could also be offered as a corporate perk to incentivize employee health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
*   **Micro-fixes/Health Assistant:** The platform could also serve as an ongoing health assistant, providing personalized reminders for habits like drinking water or correcting posture, tailored to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
*   **Potential Name:** Healthiswealth.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

### 3. Custom GPT Directories
Transforming existing online directories into personalized custom GPTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

*   **Concept:** Take successful directory models, like Nomad List (aggregating data for digital nomads), and enhance them with a custom GPT interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.
*   **Personalization:** Users could chat with the GPT, specifying their unique preferences (e.g., "I care about good weather," "I need a place less than a thousand dollars per month," "Do I need a visa?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.
*   **Monetization Challenges & Opportunities:** Direct monetization of custom GPTs is not yet widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. However, a custom GPT could serve as a lead generation mechanism, as seen with a lawyer who uses top legal GPTs to find potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. For a custom GPT to be monetizable, it needs access to specialized data that is not readily available through general AI models like ChatGPT or Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

### 4. AI-Powered Dating Apps
Leveraging AI to create dating applications that move beyond appearance-based matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.

*   **Critique of Current Apps:** Most dating apps are based on looks ("swiping based on do I like the way this person looks") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   **AI for Deeper Compatibility:** AI can capture deeper compatibility factors like humor and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.
*   **"Swiping on Memes":** An idea where users swipe on memes to gauge their sense of humor, which then informs matchmaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
*   **No-Swiping Model:** An advanced concept involves removing swiping altogether. After an initial onboarding process (e.g., swiping on memes), the app could directly assign users to a blind date, picking the time and location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. The AI could provide conversation prompts based on shared interests (e.g., "You both like this movie," "You both enjoy running") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.
*   **Integration with Personal Data:** The app could integrate with other applications like Goodreads, Netflix, Strava, or even a user's Open Page to gather information about their life and interests for more accurate matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. This would effectively create a "personalized AI matchmaker" or an "arranged marriage by AI" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

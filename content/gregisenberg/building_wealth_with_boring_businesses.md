From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Many wealthy individuals in towns across America achieved their success not through high-tech ventures, but by engaging in "boring, sweaty businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These can include sectors like underground utilities, surveying, HVAC, and real estate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The core premise is that choosing a "normal" or "boring" business significantly increases the odds of accumulating wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Why "Boring" Businesses are Profitable
While many aspiring entrepreneurs focus on software, SaaS, or AI startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, the reality is that a vast majority of these tech ventures fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. With twenty or more AI startups in every niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>, competition is fierce, often involving highly skilled individuals with significant venture capital funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

In contrast, traditional "sweaty startups" often face less sophisticated competition—businesses that might not even answer the phone or utilize modern tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. By choosing an arena with easier competition, the odds of winning and making substantial money are significantly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.

## Success Stories of Boring Startups
Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," shares his journey and various examples of profitable, everyday businesses. This approach aligns with [[Success stories of boring startups]].

### Storage Squad: A Pickup and Delivery Storage Business
Nick Huber's first venture was Storage Squad, a pickup and delivery storage service for college students, storing their belongings over the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Revenue & Profit:** At its peak, Storage Squad generated approximately $2.2 million in annual revenue, with $400,000-$500,000 in annual profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Marketing Strategy:** The primary marketing method was sidewalk chalk ads placed on college campuses, personally written over 5,000 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. They didn't use paid ads until reaching over $2 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This highlights a targeted, low-cost [[building_successful_businesses_through_targeted_media_strategies | media strategy]].
*   **Bootstrapping:** The business was bootstrapped using inexpensive, used cargo and box vans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Exit:** The business was sold in 2020 for $1.75 million, debt-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Self-Storage Facilities
Leveraging profits from Storage Squad, Nick transitioned into owning self-storage facilities, demonstrating a clear path towards [[steps_to_achieving_10_million_net_worth | wealth accumulation]].
*   **First Acquisition:** In 2019, a 40,000 sq ft, 180+ unit facility in Erie, Pennsylvania, was bought at public auction for $625,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It was neglected, generating only $4,000/month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Second Acquisition (North Georgia):** Another facility was acquired for $1.5 million. It was generating $15,600-$16,000/month in revenue, and today it generates $40,000/month, with a current valuation of $4.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This shows how simple operational improvements can drastically increase value without inventing anything or raising money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Examples of Profitable "Sweaty Startups"
These are [[opportunities_in_unconventional_business_sectors | unconventional business sectors]] that can be highly profitable.

*   **Lawn Care:** Nick's brother runs a lawn care company using only bandit signs for marketing, gaining 30-40 new customers annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. He earns over $100,000 per year working nine months, allowing for extended fishing trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This exemplifies a [[bluecollar_startup_strategies | bluecollar startup strategy]].
*   **Mobile Detailing:** A mobile detailing business, "Detailed Dogs," generated $17,000 in revenue and $10,000 profit in a month, allowing the owner to earn $120,000 annually just one year out of college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **High-End Transportation:** A buddy drives high-end transportation to the airport in Atlanta and has three other drivers, doing very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Firewood Delivery with Custom Racks:** Offering seasoned firewood delivered with custom-built racks (costing ~\$100 in materials to build in 1.5 hours) can command $800-$1,000 per delivery, potentially yielding $1,000 profit daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This can also be a subscription service and an entry point to other services like lawn mowing, snow clearing, or tree work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Local Bar TV Advertising:** A business placing small, rotating ads on TVs in local bars and restaurants can charge $10 per month per business and net $20,000 monthly, generating loyalty from local business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Putting Green Installation:** A higher-skilled service, but one that can generate $30,000 to $200,000 on high-end turf installations at houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Tree Removal:** Despite the risks and high equipment costs, two guys can earn over $3,000 for four hours of work removing trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Christmas Light Installation:** While risky due to heights, friends of Nick pay $3,500-$4,000 for professional Christmas light installation for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Power Washing:** An accessible business with low skill and capital requirements, suitable for cleaning concrete, furniture, and decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Concrete Work:** Laying driveways, slabs, and patios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Bounce House Rentals:** A favored business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## "Sweaty Digital Business": Night Nurses.com Idea
This concept combines a traditional service need with a digital platform, providing a potential [[business_in_a_box_opportunities | business in a box opportunity]].

> [13:17:00] I was looking for a nanny. My nanny quit, and it was so much work. I actually looked in Athens for a local nanny recruiting company, meaning like, "Hey, help me post the job on care.com, do the screening calls, set up, you know, do the background checks, set up interviews with people who qualify and help me find a nanny." I think I would pay $3,000 to $5,000 for that. It's a great part-time side gig for somebody.
> — Nick Huber

The idea for NightNurses.com arose from the difficulty of finding a night nurse for a newborn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. A night nurse typically watches a baby from 11 PM to 5 AM, allowing parents to sleep, which is a significant "game changer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

*   **Market Opportunity:** High-value customers who are at the beginning of their parenthood journey, suggesting opportunities for cross-selling other baby-related services or products, almost like "home outfitting for babies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Problem:** Existing marketplaces like Care.com are too broad, lacking a dedicated platform for night nurses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
*   **Proposed Solution:** Acquire NightNurses.com (available for $13,000, or $1,100/month lease-to-own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>), build a directory, use AI for content (blogs), and leverage organic traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Advertising could target pregnancy apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Service Model:** Start by offering a recruitment service where families pay a one-time fee of $1,000 for vetting, background checks, and interview setup for night nurses. The goal is to place approximately 20-30 nurses per month, generating $20,000-$30,000 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. This acts as a foundation before attempting a full marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

## The Value of Domain Names
A strong domain name is critical for a business's digital presence.

> [00:20:01] Personally, I think it's an unbelievable investment, especially when you look at it as far as look at it for what it is, which is the digital real estate that your business lives.
> — Nick Huber

*   **Digital Real Estate:** Domains are considered digital real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Companies spend millions on physical real estate or hundreds of thousands on building facades, but often hesitate to spend more than a few hundred dollars on their domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
*   **SEO and Recall:** `.com` domains are likely to be prioritized by AI models (LLMs) over `.io` or other extensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. A memorable and easy-to-spell domain can lead to more leads and significantly higher monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Nick bought somewhere.com for $450,000, which has already generated more than its cost in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
    *   BoltStorage.com was acquired for $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
    *   AdRhino.com was acquired for $2,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

## AI and Sweaty Startups: A Synergistic Approach
While many AI startups face high failure rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>, AI can become a powerful tool for traditional businesses. This perspective suggests that [[building_automated_businesses_with_ai | AI can automate aspects of businesses]].

The best AI startups may actually originate as "sweaty startups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. For example, NightNurses.com could leverage AI for directory building, content generation, and ultimately, evolve into a fintech AI company by providing services like payroll for nurses once a strong customer base is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

AI, much like the invention of the lawn mower, is seen as a tool that will enable existing business owners to earn more money with less labor, rather than displacing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

The concept of a dedicated product documentation format, similar to Google Docs but specifically tailored for product specifications, presents a significant startup opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. This idea originated from Danny Grant's list of startup concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

## The Problem and Opportunity
While generic tools like Google Docs exist, there isn't a specific tool or experience dedicated to writing product specifications that allows for inline features like creating Jira tickets or common threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:07">[02:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:07">[02:21:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:07">[02:55:07]</a>. Product templates exist, but not a full experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:07">[02:53:07]</a>.

## Proposed Solution
The idea is to build a "Google Docs for product specs" specifically for Product Managers (PMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:07">[02:30:07]</a>. This tool would streamline the process of drafting, organizing, and managing product documentation.

## Market Potential
It's estimated that PMs would be willing to pay approximately $20 per month for such a specialized tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:07">[02:34:07]</a>. This suggests a viable business model for a niche SaaS product.

## Building and Launching
This is considered a "pretty darn good idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:07">[02:17:07]</a> and "pretty straightforward software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:07">[03:40:07]</a>, though it's acknowledged as not the "simplest idea" because it requires developing software from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:07">[02:44:07]</a>.

### Development Strategy
*   **MVP Development**: The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) could be outsourced to an agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:07">[03:02:07]</a>.
*   **Partnerships**: A key strategy involves partnering with content creators who cater to product managers. The ideal partner would be someone like [[building_a_media_arm_for_startups | Lenny Ritky]], who has a significant podcast and newsletter audience among product managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:07">[03:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:07">[03:16:07]</a>.
    *   Research potential partners: Utilize tools like Perplexity.ai to identify "up and coming" creators in the product management space who could become aspiring "Lenny Ritzes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:07">[03:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.
*   **Pre-Development Steps**: Before committing to building, it's advised to:
    *   Create a catchy name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:07">[03:44:07]</a>.
    *   Develop mockups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:07">[03:57:07]</a>.
    *   Secure buy-in from two to four creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:07">[03:49:07]</a>. This validation helps determine whether to proceed with development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:07">[04:00:07]</a>.

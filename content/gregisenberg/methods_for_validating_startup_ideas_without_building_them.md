Starting a business often involves significant investment and time, but it's possible to validate [[entrepreneurial_startup_ideas | startup ideas]] and gauge market demand before committing to full product development. Justin Mayers, founder of Kettle and Fire, a multi-million dollar business, shares his "day zero" steps for validating a concept with minimal resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Step 1: Initial Market & Community Research

The first step in validating a startup idea is to understand if there's an existing demand for your product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

### Identifying a Personal Problem and Niche
Justin Mayers' journey with Kettle and Fire began with a personal interest in bone broth, which he learned about from friends in the CrossFit community and through reading about its health benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. At the time (2014), bone broth was not widely available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This personal connection and identified gap formed the basis of his idea.

### Community Engagement Analysis
To gauge interest and validate the idea, Justin explored online communities where his target audience (e.g., paleo and CrossFit enthusiasts) gathered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. He specifically looked at:
*   Mark's Daily Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>
*   Paleo Hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>
*   [[using_reddit_to_find_startup_ideas | Reddit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>

He observed the level of traffic and engagement in threads discussing bone broth, recipes, sourcing bones, and cooking times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. This showed a small but "fanatic" and interested group of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

### Macro-Level Trend Analysis
Beyond niche communities, Justin used Google Trends to see how "bone broth" was performing at a macro level, noting that it was "starting to take off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This combination of micro-community engagement and macro-trend validation provided confidence that "at least enough people" were interested in the product to build a small business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

## Step 2: Validating Willingness to Pay (The "Pre-Sale" Method)

The crucial second step is to determine if people will pay enough to make the business meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

### Minimal Viable "Product" Creation
Justin created a minimal representation of his product and business:
1.  **Domain Name**: Purchased the cheapest domain name with "bone broth" in it for $9.99 (e.g., bonebroths.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.
2.  **Logo & Renders**: Paid $5 on Fiverr for a basic logo and product renders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. Today, [[creating_startup_ideas_using_ai | AI tools]] could generate much better designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.
3.  **Landing Page**: Built a simple landing page using Unbounce (now, [[ai_tools_for_validating_and_developing_startup_ideas | AI tools]] could build superior ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. The page highlighted value propositions identified from paleo forums, such as:
    *   Healing leaky gut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>
    *   Convenience (avoiding 24-48 hours of cooking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>
    *   Quality ingredients (organic, 100% grass-fed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>

### Pricing Strategy and Payment Mechanism
Justin set a premium price of $29.99 for 16 ounces of bone broth, significantly higher than typical grocery store broth ($5 for 16 ounces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. This higher price point aimed to ensure profitability if the product ever materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

Crucially, the "Order Bone Broth Now" button on the landing page redirected to his personal PayPal account, effectively asking customers to send him money directly for a non-existent product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

### Running Paid Ads and Analyzing Results
To drive traffic to the landing page, Justin spent about $100 on Bing Ads (which was cheaper than Google Ads at the time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. Over a two-week test, despite the "super sketchy checkout flow," people were actually paying him money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

The test yielded a 30% conversion rate (people clicking "order now") and nearly $500 in "revenue" from roughly $250 in ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. This strongly validated that people were willing to pay for the concept, even with a janky setup, suggesting a potential for a $100,000+ per year business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

## Step 3: Post-Validation & Customer Management

After confirming demand, Justin immediately addressed the customers who had "purchased" the non-existent product. He sent an email explaining that the product wasn't yet in stock and offered two options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>:
1.  A full refund.
2.  A 50% discount and shipment in a few weeks (which optimistically turned into eight months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

Most customers chose the discount and expressed excitement for the product, demonstrating strong commitment and interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. This approach validated the idea and bought him time to figure out how to actually manufacture and scale Kettle and Fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

## Modern Approaches for Validation (2025 Perspective)

Justin Mayers notes that while the core validation principles remain, [[developing_startup_ideas_with_ai_assistance | AI assistance]] and new tools make the process even more efficient today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>.

### Leveraging AI for Design and Research
*   **Enhanced Landing Pages & Logos**: [[ai_tools_for_validating_and_developing_startup_ideas | AI tools]] can create significantly better visual assets and landing pages than were available in 2015 for minimal cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.
*   **Sentiment Analysis**: [[ai_tools_for_validating_and_developing_startup_ideas | AI]] can quickly scrape and analyze sentiment across platforms like [[using_reddit_to_find_startup_ideas | Reddit]], forums, and Twitter, providing deeper insights into customer desires and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>.

### Recommended Tools
Justin highlights the importance of getting familiar with new [[aipowered_startup_ideas | AI-powered startup ideas]] and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>:
*   **Bolt.new**: An interesting tool for building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>, potentially for creating landing pages quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>.
*   **Rok**: Another recommended tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.
*   **Frontier Models**: Experimenting with advanced models like Claude, GPT-4o, and Gemini is crucial for staying ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.

These tools enable individuals to launch and test dozens of [[profitable_startup_ideas | profitable startup ideas]] per month, making it easier to find the right one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>. They significantly lower the barriers to [[developing_startup_ideas_into_businesses | developing startup ideas into businesses]] by allowing one person to achieve what previously required a team, especially for consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>.

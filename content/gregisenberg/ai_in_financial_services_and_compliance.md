[[applications_of_ai_in_business_and_startups | AI applications in business]] are proving transformative, particularly in the financial sector, where they automate manual tasks and enhance operational efficiency. The financial services industry is highly competitive, attracting some of the smartest people in the world [00:25:08].

## Current Applications and Companies

Several companies are leveraging [[applications_of_ai_in_business_and_startups | AI]] to address specific, often manual, problems within financial services and compliance:

*   **Sling Money** uses [[applications_of_ai_in_business_and_startups | AI]] for customer service and financial crime compliance [00:05:04]. It automates repetitive tasks that are typically a significant pain point [00:05:13].
*   **Greenlight (GRNLIT)** is an [[applications_of_ai_in_business_and_startups | AI]] solution for financial crime (fin crime) and compliance [00:08:12]. It performs enhanced due diligence by searching the web and consolidating information on individuals, automating manual research work for banks and financial products [00:05:17], [00:08:35]. Greenlight was Sling Money's first customer and design partner, and is seen as a potentially "huge business" [00:09:08], [00:09:20].
*   **Gradient AI** builds customer service [[ai_as_a_junior_researcher_and_execution_assistant | agents]] that "dramatically outperform" existing [[applications_of_ai_in_business_and_startups | AI]] built into platforms like Intercom [00:10:57], [00:11:10]. The founders of Gradient [[ai_as_a_junior_researcher_and_execution_assistant | AI]] were part of the data science team at Monzo, a Neo Bank in the UK [00:11:20]. Their focus is on discreet, specific, and very manual problems [00:11:32].
*   **Bland** specializes in [[ai_as_a_junior_researcher_and_execution_assistant | AI]] phone calls for various business functions, including sales, customer support, and operations [00:11:55], [00:12:08]. It supports multiple languages, allows users to choose voices, and can be "taught" like an employee [00:12:10], [00:12:16]. It also integrates with existing tools like Salesforce [00:12:20]. There is a large opportunity to create country-specific versions of such businesses (e.g., Bland for Germany or Canada) [00:12:30], [00:12:40].
*   **Domu**, a YC company, focuses on [[ai_as_a_junior_researcher_and_execution_assistant | AI]] debt collection [00:13:15]. The insight behind Domu is that the best human debt collectors are deeply empathetic and thoughtful, using gentle phrasing like offering flexible payment plans [00:13:30], [00:13:46]. This approach, despite being nuanced, can be automated via an [[ai_as_a_junior_researcher_and_execution_assistant | AI]] script that learns [00:14:05], [00:14:08].

These examples highlight a trend of building highly customized [[ai_as_a_junior_researcher_and_execution_assistant | AI engines]] around specific, manual, and often painful tasks, utilizing tight feedback loops to achieve success [00:14:30], [00:14:34].

## Pricing and Monetization for AI Businesses

For [[applications_of_ai_in_business_and_startups | AI]] companies, a key pricing strategy is to consider the amount and cost of human input saved [00:34:51], [00:34:54]. This "total cost" includes not only salary but also "emotional damage" or frustration caused by manual tasks [00:35:01]. Even if a task only takes a few minutes, the emotional toll saved can justify a higher price [00:35:13].

The strategy involves calculating the total value saved for the customer (e.g., $100,000 in labor + $50,000 in emotional damage = $150,000) and then applying a significant discount (e.g., 50-80%) because a machine is performing the task [00:35:30], [00:35:44]. This approach aims to create a "no-brainer offer" for the customer [00:35:54].

Regarding pricing adjustments, conventional wisdom suggests it's easier to lower prices than raise them [00:36:12]. However, if a product is truly valuable and loved by users, it is possible to increase prices later. Monzo, for example, successfully introduced fees for services that were previously free, such as ATM withdrawals or replacement cards, because users perceived the changes as fair due to the value the product already provided [00:37:13], [00:37:36], [00:37:51]. This indicates that customers remember value more than initial pricing [00:38:44].

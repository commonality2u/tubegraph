Leveraging external documentation by "tagging docs" in Cursor AI is a crucial practice for ensuring the AI's output is accurate and up-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:53">[01:52:53]</a>. This method provides the AI with the most current and authoritative information, directly from the source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:11">[02:13:11]</a>.

## Why Tag Docs?
AI models often scrape the internet at specific times, which can lead to outdated information or non-best practices being used in their responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>. By tagging documentation, you provide Cursor with the latest and greatest information for the technologies you are using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:38">[02:13:38]</a>. This helps to:
*   Ensure accuracy and adherence to current best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>.
*   Improve the quality of code generation and problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:54">[02:16:54]</a>.
*   Streamline debugging by allowing Cursor to use up-to-date information to solve issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:10">[02:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:25">[02:22:25]</a>.

## How to Tag Documentation in Cursor

The process for tagging documentation within Cursor is straightforward:
1.  Open the Composer view in Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:25">[02:25:25]</a>.
2.  Click "Add" and then select "Docs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:31">[02:30:31]</a>.
3.  Choose "Add new Doc" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:40">[02:30:40]</a>.
4.  Copy the URL of the relevant documentation (e.g., `nextjs.org/docs`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:44">[02:30:44]</a>.
5.  Paste the URL into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:48">[02:30:48]</a>.
6.  Name the document (e.g., "Next.js docs") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:52">[02:30:52]</a>.
7.  Confirm to save the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:56">[02:30:56]</a>.

Once tagged, Cursor AI has access to this documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:56">[02:30:56]</a>. When you ask questions or encounter issues, Cursor can reference this specific, reliable source of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:11">[02:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:59">[02:20:59]</a>.

### Examples
*   **[[ai_coding_workflow_and_best_practices | Next.js]]**: Adding the official documentation (`nextjs.org/docs`) allows Cursor to provide accurate information on how to build components, set up pages, and understand routing within a [[ai_coding_workflow_and_best_practices | Next.js]] application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:56">[02:19:56]</a>.
*   **Supabase**: For database-related queries, tagging the Supabase documentation provides Cursor with the necessary context to resolve issues and provide correct code examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:36">[02:23:36]</a>.

## Learning Through Documentation
Even for non-technical users, it's beneficial to at least "take a breeze" at the documentation of the technologies being used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:12">[02:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:18">[02:16:18]</a>. This helps in understanding the ecosystem and speaking the "language" of the frameworks, which can expedite the learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:05">[02:40:05]</a>. If something doesn't make sense, you can screenshot it and ask the AI to explain it in simpler terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>.

By proactively providing context through tagged documentation, you are "onboarding" your AI assistant, making it a more effective and aligned co-pilot for your projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:51">[02:54:51]</a>.

> "Context is key with all these AI models... what you and I are doing is just giving it as much context as possible with what we're building with what we're doing so it's sort of aligned with us." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:51">[02:54:51]</a>

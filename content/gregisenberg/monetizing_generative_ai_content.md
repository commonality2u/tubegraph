This article explores strategies for creating and monetizing content using generative AI, specifically focusing on Google V3 for video creation. PJ, a creator known for viral AI films, shares his process and insights on how to leverage this technology to [[monetization_strategies_for_ai_applications | make money]] and [[monetization_strategies_for_ai_applications | build a business around generative AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## The Core Opportunity
Many tutorials focus on the technical aspects of AI content creation, but often overlook how to actually [[monetization_strategies_for_ai_applications | make money]] from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. With the abundance of content, and generative AI poised to increase it tenfold or even a hundredfold, understanding audience engagement is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The ability to understand *why* people engage, watch, and share content is more important than just technical creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Content Creation Process: From Idea to Viral Video
PJ outlines his step-by-step method for consistently creating viral content, using a satirical pharmaceutical commercial as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### 1. Idea Generation: The Unexpected Hook
The process begins with an idea that offers an "unexpected" hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. For the pharmaceutical ad, the initial concept was a placebo pill that led to a dog delivery, which evolved into a pill secreting pheromones to attract puppies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Leverage AI for Twists**: If you lack a "kernel" idea, you can ask tools like ChatGPT for satirical twists on common commercial formats (e.g., SNL-style pharmaceutical ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Experiment with LLMs**: Don't limit yourself to one Large Language Model (LLM); try ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok (especially its unhinged mode) to generate diverse ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

### 2. Scripting with ChatGPT
The script is developed iteratively using ChatGPT.
*   **Initial Prompt**: Start with generalized instructions to get a cliche script, then tear it apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. For the pharmaceutical ad, the prompt included details like a fake medication name with "pup," a 20-second format, starting with depression, and an SNL-style satirical take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: Provide feedback to ChatGPT, asking for "comedic examples" or more "zingers/one-liners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. By continually refeeding favorite lines, the model learns and updates, leading to a significant portion of the final script being AI-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   **Outsourcing Taste**: If you lack comedic taste, you can ask ChatGPT to generate jokes in the style of a specific comedian (e.g., Seth Rogen, Bill Burr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

### 3. Prompting Google V3 for Video
Once the script is refined, each dialogue line is converted into a visual prompt for V3.
*   **Simple Prompting**: V3 does not require overly complicated prompts; a simple description of what's happening and the dialogue is often sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. However, you can include details about pose, shot type, camera movement (e.g., dolly in), and background elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. You can even describe emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.
*   **Cost Management**: V3 shots can cost $2-3 each, so it's advisable to run them one at a time and refine prompts if the output isn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. The pharmaceutical commercial cost around $500 in V3 credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   **Audio and Subtitles**: V3 generates audio, but it may sound "thin" and lack voice consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. To avoid weird gibberish subtitles, avoid including quotes in your prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **Character Consistency**: Text-to-video doesn't guarantee character consistency yet. To achieve similar-looking characters, describe them in detail the same way every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

### 4. Editing and Post-Production
*   **Software**: PJ uses Final Cut Pro, but recommends CapCut or DaVinci Resolve (a free, top-tier option) for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.
*   **Clip Selection**: Expect a 3:1 to 5:1 ratio of generated clips to good ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

## Distribution and Hooking the Audience
A strong hook is vital for viral content, especially on platforms like X (Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
*   **Headline First**: The headline (title) is more important than the thumbnail, which is more important than the content itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. On X, the headline has 0-2 seconds to grab attention, and the content has 2-3 seconds to make them stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.
*   **Crafting Provocative Hooks**: Viral headlines often feature:
    *   A "low-key flex" to establish credibility (e.g., "I used to shoot $500K pharmaceutical commercials") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.
    *   Trend-jacking (e.g., "I made this for $500 in V3 credits") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.
    *   Symmetry in numbers (e.g., $500K to $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
    *   Questions to generate replies and feed the algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
    *   Clear value proposition (e.g., "Steal my prompt below") to encourage clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   **Avoid Generic Clickbait**: While phrases like "Hollywood is cooked" can work, find your unique phrasing to avoid sounding like everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

## [[monetization_strategies_for_ai_applications | Monetization Strategies for AI Applications]]
PJ outlines ten ways to [[monetization_strategies_for_ai_applications | monetize V3 and content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>:

1.  **Build a Personal Brand**: Use V3 to create content that you're proud of, which can lead to downstream work and establish your presence in the [[the_evolving_role_of_ai_in_content_creation | ecosystem of content creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. An audience is worth a lot of money, and V3 can help you get followers quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.
2.  **Attract Direct Clients for Commercials**: Create specialized commercials for specific niches (e.g., food products, beer companies, underwear brands) that desire "unhinged special effects" that traditional agencies cannot deliver at AI's budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>. Pricing can range from $5,000 on the low end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. The value lies in your skill as a filmmaker and your unique point of view, not just the low cost of AI credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. This also opens the door to underserved niches that couldn't afford traditional cinematography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.
3.  **Build a Portfolio for Agencies**: Create a specialized portfolio, focusing on a niche that interests you (e.g., knife commercials). You can "steal" (reapply) award-winning commercial templates by feeding screenshots to ChatGPT to generate prompts, then adapting them for a similar, but different, product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. This helps level up your skills by copying the greats and finding your own voice over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.
4.  **Create a Narrative Series with In-Universe Brand Integrations**: Build a unique universe and integrate products naturally within the narrative. An example is "Neural Viz," a creator who built the "moniverse" and could monetize through aliens discovering modern artifacts as product placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. This leverages popular social formats with a unique AI twist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.
5.  **Sell Courses/Digital Products**: Bundle your knowledge and processes into a course, PDF, or other digital product for sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.
6.  **Consulting with Larger Companies**: Offer expertise to Fortune 500 companies on how to integrate generative AI into their operations, including legal compliance and security procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. [[strategies_for_pricing_and_monetization_in_ai | Pricing]] for consulting should scale with the size of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.
7.  **Build a Sketch Comedy Channel**: While harder to monetize directly, a large audience (as seen on TikTok with Bang Energy drinks) can attract brand integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.
8.  **Create Narrative Films**: While possible, PJ is not as bullish on long-form narrative content (e.g., 90-minute feature films) with generative AI because the technology iterates too fast, leading to potential inconsistencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. Weekly episodic content is generally favored in the new [[monetizing_creator_content_and_optimizing_advertising_strategies | creator economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.
9.  **Pitch Brands on Narrative Content**: Offer to create episodic narrative series (e.g., 10 episodes, 2 minutes each) centered around a brand's products or themes, charging anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>.
10. **Focus on Small Sub-Niches with High Demand/Low Supply**: Target niches with open-sourced IP and a large, engaged audience but low existing content supply. Examples include Bible content (2 billion daily active users) or "Romantasy" (romantic fantasy) BookTok, where authors may pay for AI-generated book promos or scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. This represents significant [[market_potential_of_aigenerated_content | market potential]] for AI-generated content.

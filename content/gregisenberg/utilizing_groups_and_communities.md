One effective strategy for acquiring customers and leads, particularly for startups without a social media following or large advertising budget, involves [[analyzing_community_problems_and_solutions_for_validated_startup_ideas | leveraging groups and communities]] where your target audience already congregates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This approach focuses on delivering value and building trust rather than direct solicitation or content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Identifying Audience Hubs

The first step is to identify where your target audience spends their time online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. These can include:
*   Paid community groups, such as [[the_acp_framework_for_building_an_audience | Startup Empire.co]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   Free groups on platforms like Discord, School, or Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.
*   Reddit groups focused on specific niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   The comment sections of YouTube channels or other creators dedicated to relevant topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   Q&A platforms like Quora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

## Delivering Extreme Value

Once you've identified these communities, the key is to actively participate by delivering "extreme levels of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. This involves:

### Active Participation Without Selling
Dedicate an initial period, such as an entire month, to being the most valuable person in the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. This means:
*   **Zero Spamming**: Avoid directly promoting your services or asking people to contact you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Problem Solving**: When people ask questions, provide thorough, detailed, and helpful answers. For example, if someone asks about web design, offer a comprehensive solution without expecting follow-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
*   **Resource Sharing**: Offer free templates or other useful resources that address common challenges within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   **Observation**: Pay attention to the recurring challenges and pain points expressed by community members, as this can inform your future offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

### Engaging with Creators
Beyond specific groups, you can apply this strategy to content creators in your niche:
*   **Turn on Notifications**: Enable notifications for creators you follow to be among the first to comment on their new content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.
*   **Provide Thoughtful Comments**: Avoid generic comments like "cool video" or "great thread." Instead, add genuine value through thoughtful insights or additional information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.
*   **Build Trust**: Consistent, valuable comments can build trust with the creator and other commenters, potentially leading to collaborations or recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. One individual, Omar, became an occasional co-host on the podcast after consistently engaging with the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
*   **Share Content**: Share the creator's content to demonstrate genuine interest and help them reach a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

### Creating Over-the-Top Content
For those willing to create [[usergenerated_content_strategies | content]], but not necessarily as a personal brand:
*   **Focus on Value**: Create tutorials or guides that are "ludicrously over-the-top valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.
*   **Low Quality, High Effort**: The production quality doesn't need to be high (e.g., 720p video), but the effort in providing comprehensive, in-depth information should be significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.
*   **Address Specific Problems**: Use platforms like Quora to identify common questions and create long-form videos (e.g., 5-hour, zero-to-finished tutorials) that directly answer those questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.
*   **Passive Consumption**: Many users consume long-form content passively, such as listening in the background, making comprehensive answers valuable even if not actively watched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.

> "low quality is the new high quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>
> "low quality, high effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>

## Benefits
By consistently delivering value in these communities, you can:
*   **Generate Leads**: This approach can generate leads for free or at a very low monthly cost, especially compared to paid advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.
*   **Build Momentum**: Within about a month, consistent effort can start to build significant momentum for your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.
*   **Attract Clients**: This strategy can account for approximately 80% of your initial clients in the first few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.
*   **Gain Insights**: Actively listening in these groups helps you understand the market's needs, which can inform your product or service development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

This strategy complements other customer acquisition methods, such as [[reaching_out_to_potential_partners | the Dream 100 method]], by directly engaging with your target audience where they already exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>. It's a high-leverage activity that can lead to explosive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

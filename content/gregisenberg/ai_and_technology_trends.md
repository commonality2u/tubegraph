The current landscape of AI and technology is seeing a surge in applications leveraging existing large language models like ChatGPT. This has led to the emergence of highly successful, niche-focused applications that prioritize branding and marketing over complex technological innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## Current AI Application Landscape

Many new products are essentially "wrappers" built on top of [[innovative_ai_functionalities_in_apps | AI functionalities]], often making significant revenue by focusing on specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

### Case Study: Air RZ Studio and its Apps

A prime example is a 23-year-old founder who co-founded a small development studio, Air RZ, which has launched three apps, collectively closing in on $500,000 of revenue per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. This studio focuses on "[[aibased_startup_ideas_and_growth_strategies | AI-based startup ideas and growth strategies]]" by offering coaching in different verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

The apps include:
*   **Plug AI** (also referred to as Riz) – An [[AI in Content Creation and Marketing | AI dating coach]] and texting assistant that generates pickup lines from text message screenshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. It has achieved $190,000 per month in revenue and 333,000 downloads per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. The idea for this app originated from a Tinder subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Its success is attributed to strong marketing, branding, and referral flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   **Astra** – An AI life advice app that assists with life challenges, compatibility, personal growth, and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.
*   **Pallet** – Uses [[the_rise_of_ai_in_design_and_creative_industries | AI]] to determine a user's color season from a selfie, providing custom color palettes, personalized style, and makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

The strategy behind these apps involves leveraging existing technology, developing interesting brands with great positioning, and focusing on specific niches rather than trying to cater to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

### Investment Perspective and Sustainability

Despite concerns about the longevity of such "flash in the pan" businesses due to reliance on underlying platforms like OpenAI, the financial returns can be substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:50:00">[23:50:00]</a>. For example, if a business generates $350,000 in profit per month, it could earn $4 million in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:00">[24:04:00]</a>. The skills acquired in running such ventures, regardless of their short-term nature, are transferable to future businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.

Investing in such a business could involve a profit-sharing model rather than seeking equity, as the goal is often profit generation rather than a massive IPO or exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>.

> "Sometimes you need to change your world before you change the world."<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>

The practical approach of focusing on immediate financial stability ("getting your first nut") is often overlooked by those who solely advocate for world-changing ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:00">[25:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>.

## Emerging Opportunities and Anti-Trends

The high competition in obvious AI use cases (like dating and therapy) suggests that focusing on "non-obvious use cases" for AI apps might be a more fruitful strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.

### The Anti-Trend Phenomenon

A significant opportunity lies in the concept of "anti-trends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. When a trend emerges, an "anti-trend" often follows, providing unique startup ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

For instance, the trend of [[using_ai_to_analyze_trends_and_generate_business_concepts | AI-based coaching]] and texting assistants creates a demand for human-centric services that can charge a premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>. An AI app could offer a premium upgrade with human intervention, or an entirely new company could emerge offering a human version of an AI service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. Such "anti-trend" businesses typically face less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

### Examples of Anti-Trends

*   **Anti-Biohacking/Longevity:** While Brian Johnson represents the extreme trend of biohacking and longevity, an anti-trend could focus on hedonistic living without concern for health optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>.
*   **Human Coaching vs. AI Coaching:** As AI coaching apps become prevalent, there's a growing demand for human coaching services that offer a more personalized and empathetic experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>.

### Networking and Deals

In the context of business growth, a significant observation is the effectiveness of direct, personal communication like offering one's phone number for texts or calls. This approach can lead to closing large corporate deals that might not otherwise happen through traditional channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. It creates a sense of inviting someone into one's "home," fostering stronger relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

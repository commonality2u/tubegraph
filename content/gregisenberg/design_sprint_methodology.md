The [[Design Sprint methodology | Design Sprint]] was created by Jake Knapp, who originally came from Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The core purpose of the Design Sprint and its preceding methodologies is to help build products with the highest probability of success by providing a framework, process, and methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. It's about figuring out how to get the best out of a good idea, evaluating which ideas to pursue, and tuning promising ideas into their best form to make them unique and worth attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The Foundation Sprint

The Foundation Sprint is described as a prequel to the traditional [[Design Sprint methodology | Design Sprint]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. It is designed for early-stage startups or when a founder has an idea but hasn't built anything yet, or is just starting to experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This method helps clarify the vision and strategy from blurriness to clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>, focusing on finding what makes a product stand out in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>.

The process typically takes about two hours if done with a team, though it can be faster for an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. It forces participants to go through a "fog lifting" experience, allowing them to decide whether to proceed with an idea or abandon it if it lacks differentiation, advantage, or motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

### Key Steps of the Foundation Sprint

The big steps of the Foundation Sprint include identifying the basics, discussing [[Differentiation in product development | differentiation]], and exploring different forms the idea might take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

#### Basics

This initial phase aims to crisply identify key elements of the product idea. It's a first-principles approach to product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, often revealing things founders hadn't explicitly considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

*   **Customer Identification**: Clearly define who the target customer is. For an AI rapper startup "hit.me," the initial target customer was identified as "entrepreneurs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>, specifically "knowledge workers" aged 25-40 in the tech or product space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>.
*   **Problem Definition**: Articulate the specific problem the product aims to solve for the customer. For "hit.me," the problem was "overconsumption" of social media, leading to digital addiction and a feeling of "dark emptiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, specifically overconsumption instead of creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This problem's prevalence can be sniff-tested with tools like Google Trends, which showed a significant increase in searches for "phone addiction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   **Special Capability**: Identify what unique skills or resources the founder or team brings that gives them an edge. For the "hit.me" concept, key capabilities were identified as "funnel building" and "design" expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. This differentiates from developers who might build without a design-first approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Unique Insight**: Discover something the founder understands or guesses about the problem that others don't. While publicly available data (like Google Trends) can show a problem exists, a true insight is a deeper, less obvious understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. For "hit.me," the insight evolved from simply "AI plus design" to "the destructive results of consuming versus creating" and the recognition that current products replicate non-stop scrolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. A key insight was also the idea of time-capping usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This insight led to a potential pivot: focusing the product on switching consumption into creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   **Motivation**: Understand the driving force behind building the product. Pure financial motivation is often less special than a personal connection to the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. For the "hit.me" idea, the founder's motivation was personal anxiety related to overconsumption and a desire to create rather than consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>, stemming from a past of regret over not creating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. While this can lead to a "Homer car" (a product too tailored to one person's niche desires) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>, it's balanced by considering the customer's problem and validating with experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
*   **Competitors**: Identify existing solutions or workarounds. Competitors can be other products (like Brick, News Feed Eradicator, Freedom, iPhone's screen time features) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>, or broader societal movements (like "no social media movements," "digital detox retreats") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. The most significant competitor often isn't another product but rather the customer's own "self-control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.

#### [[Differentiation in product development | Differentiation]]

This stage involves crafting a compelling narrative for the product, positioning it to "destroy" competitors and win in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. The goal is to create a 2x2 diagram where your product is in the "upper right" quadrant, and competitors are pushed to "loserville" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. [[Differentiation in product development | Differentiation]] should be considered from the customer's perspective from the very inception of a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.

*   **Classic Differentiators**: Evaluate the product against standard scales such as:
    *   Slow to Fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>
    *   Not Smart to Smart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>
    *   Hard to Use to Easy to Use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>
    *   Expensive to Free (free is a powerful concept as people act irrationally when something is free) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>
    *   One-size-fits-all to Focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>
    *   Complicated to Simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>
    *   Integrated to Siloed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>
*   **Custom Differentiators**: Brainstorm unique differentiators specific to the product and problem. For "hit.me," a custom differentiator was "replace distraction to remove distraction" by offering "creation dopamine" instead of just removing dopamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>. This could also include [[Prototyping and communication for business ideas | business model]] types, like a pay-per-use model over a subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

### Conclusion

The Foundation Sprint primes founders to think about their market opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. Even if the founder doesn't have a "magical experience" leading to a pivot, simply laying out what's in their head can be powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. It is recommended to perform this process with humans first, and then seek feedback from others or AI tools like ChatGPT, as AI might provide an "oatmeal version" compared to unique human insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.

This methodology helps ensure that the product's special qualities are "truly embodied" in the product itself, making it easy to talk about and for customers to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>. Without clear differentiation, marketing a product becomes a "slog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

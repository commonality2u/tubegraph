The [[Design tips and tricks for nondesigners | Design Sprint]] is a structured process for solving problems and testing new ideas, originally co-created by Jake Knapp at Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. More recently, Jake Knapp also created the **Foundation Sprint**, which serves as a prequel to the [[Design tips and tricks for nondesigners | Design Sprint]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. It is designed to be conducted *before* a [[Design tips and tricks for nondesigners | Design Sprint]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## The Foundation Sprint

The Foundation Sprint offers a framework and methodology to help build a product with the highest probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It is a "first principles" approach for figuring out how to build a [[AI Startup Idea Generation | startup idea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This method helps to clarify vision and strategy, moving from blurriness to clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. It allows for more freedom and exploration compared to a traditional [[Design tips and tricks for nondesigners | Design Sprint]], where it can be difficult to deviate once the process has started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

The core idea behind the Foundation Sprint is to determine if a product solves a genuine problem and if people will be excited about the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. It helps identify what makes a product special and how it can stand out in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>.

### Key Steps and Elements

The Foundation Sprint typically involves several big steps:

1.  **Identify the Basics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>: This involves crisply defining key elements of the product idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   **Customer**: Who is the target user for the product? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
    *   **Problem**: What specific problem does the product aim to solve for the customer? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
    *   **Special Capability**: What unique strengths or advantages does the creator or team possess that might give them an edge against competitors? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a> This could include skills like [[prototyping_and_app_development_for_nonprogrammers | design]] or [[leveraging_community_insights_and_feedback_for_product_development | marketing]] ("funnel master") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
    *   **Insight**: What unique understanding or knowledge does the creator have about the problem or market that others might not possess? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a> This is more specific than easily accessible data like Google Trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
    *   **Motivation**: What drives the creator to pursue this specific idea? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a> A strong, unique motivation (even if personal) can inform differentiation and drive the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.
    *   **Competitors**: How do people currently try to solve this problem, or what existing products serve as alternatives or workarounds? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a> This includes direct products, movements (e.g., no social media), and even self-control as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

2.  **Differentiation**: Once the basics are defined, the focus shifts to how the product can stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This involves creating a 2x2 diagram where the product is positioned in the "upper right" quadrant, pushing competitors into other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Classic Differentiators**: Evaluating the product against common scales like slow-to-fast, not-so-smart-to-smart, hard-to-easy-to-use, expensive-to-free, one-size-fits-all-to-focused, and simple-to-complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
    *   **Custom Differentiators**: Identifying unique ways the product can differentiate itself that are not covered by classic scales, such as replacing distraction with creation instead of simply removing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.

3.  **Considering Different Forms**: Explore various forms the idea might take and determine which would be best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

The process helps to craft the product's story and market positioning from the very beginning, ensuring it is embodied in the product rather than just slapped on at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

### Outcomes and Benefits

*   **Clarity**: Helps founders gain a clear understanding of their product's core elements and market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.
*   **Validation**: Aids in evaluating whether an idea is promising before significant investment of time and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.
*   **Differentiation Strategy**: Provides a framework to intentionally develop a unique selling proposition that allows the product to "destroy" competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Foundation for Future Steps**: Primes the team for subsequent steps like [[prototyping_and_interactivity_in_figma_design_workflow | prototyping]] and running [[Design tips and tricks for nondesigners | Design Sprints]] to test the product with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

The Foundation Sprint method is detailed in the book *Click* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>, and a template for it can be found at clickbook.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.

## AI Tools in the Process

While AI tools like Chat GPT can provide feedback, it is suggested that founders primarily go through the Foundation Sprint process with humans (either themselves or a team) first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>. The "spicier" and more opinionated ideas often come from human thinking, although AI feedback can be a supplementary step after initial human-led definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>.

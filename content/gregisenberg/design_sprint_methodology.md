The [[Design and user interface considerations in web apps | Design Sprint]] is a structured methodology for solving big problems and testing new ideas, co-created by Jake Knapp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The core aim of this process is to build a product with the highest probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

## The Foundation Sprint

The Foundation Sprint is a prequel to the [[Design and user interface considerations in web apps | Design Sprint]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. It's designed for smart founders with an idea who haven't yet built anything or are just starting to explore a concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. The method aims to clarify an idea from its initial "foggy" state to a clear vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.

### Key Steps of the Foundation Sprint

The process involves several key steps to crisply identify and define the core elements of a product idea:

1.  **Identify the Basics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
    *   **Customer:** Who is the target user? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> For example, initially, "knowledge workers" or "entrepreneurs" aged 25-40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   **Problem:** What specific problem are you solving for the customer? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a> An example problem is "overconsumption" of social media, leading to feelings of "dark emptiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    *   **Special Capability:** What unique skill or resource does the founder or team possess that gives them an edge? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> Examples include strong marketing skills, [[Design and user interface considerations in web apps | design]] expertise, or even a good sense of humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
    *   **Insight:** What unique understanding or guess about the problem or solution does the founder have that others might not? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> A powerful insight is one that is not easily accessible to others, unlike general market trends from tools like Google Trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. An example is the insight into the "destructive results of consuming versus creating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:30]</a>.
    *   **Motivation:** What deep personal or professional reason drives the founder to solve this particular problem? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a> This could be a "hair on fire" passion for a problem, even if it's selfish initially, as long as it's balanced with customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
    *   **Competitors:** Who are the existing solutions or workarounds people use to solve the problem today? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a> This includes direct products (e.g., Brick, News Feed Eradicator), built-in phone features (e.g., Screen Time), movements (e.g., no social media), and even "self-control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. The most significant competitor is often the "800-pound gorilla" that people try to use first, such as self-control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>.

2.  **Differentiation Strategy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>
    *   The goal is to create a "2x2" business diagram where your product is positioned in the "upper right" quadrant, making competitors appear "crummy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
    *   This involves plotting how your product stacks up against competitors on various scales, such as slow to fast, not smart to smart, hard to use to easy to use, expensive to free, and one-size-fits-all to focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
    *   It also includes identifying unique, custom differentiators that truly separate your product from the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:06]</a>. An example is "replace distraction" (offering a better alternative) versus "remove distraction" (simply blocking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.

### Benefits and Philosophy

*   **First Principles:** The method emphasizes going back to first principles rather than immediately focusing on tools or specific technologies like [[AI Product Designer Overview | AI]] or specific development frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solving Focus:** It helps determine if a product truly solves a problem and if people will be excited about the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Conviction:** By laying out ideas, it clarifies vision and strategy, priming the founder to think about market opportunity and potential differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:40]</a>. This process fosters conviction, which is crucial for pursuing an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:21]</a>.
*   **Early Differentiation:** Starting with differentiation from the project's inception helps embody it within the product, making marketing and sales easier later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:53]</a>. If [[Inspiration and iteration in design | clear differentiation]] is absent, effective marketing becomes significantly harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:55]</a>.
*   **Human-Centric Approach:** While [[AI Product Designer Overview | AI]] tools like Chat GPT can provide feedback, the initial thinking and processing should be done by humans. AI tends to offer "oatmeal" versions of ideas, lacking the "spicier" and unique perspectives that humans bring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:35]</a>.
*   **Decision-Making:** The process allows founders to "sleep on" their ideas before investing significant time and energy, helping them decide if they truly want to build the product or if there's too much competition or a lack of motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:53]</a>.

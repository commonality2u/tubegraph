To maximize the output and quality from large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini, a technique involves leveraging competition among them to generate superior results, copy, and overall content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This method, which costs no money, can increase output quality by approximately five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The "Jealousy" Method for Enhanced AI Output

The core of this [[prompting_techniques_for_effective_use_of_ai_models | prompting technique]] involves making LLMs "jealous" of each other to elicit better responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Instead of using a single LLM for a task, the process requires opening multiple LLMs simultaneously (two, three, or even four at a time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The steps are as follows:
1.  **Initial Prompting**: Provide the same prompt to each LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
2.  **Output Comparison**: Evaluate the responses from each LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
3.  **Strategic Feedback**: Introduce "jealousy" by pitting the LLMs against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This often involves providing subjective feedback, potentially exaggerating or even fabricating praise for one model's output when addressing another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This method, while seemingly "mean," has been observed to significantly improve results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

This approach is an effective [[tips_for_using_ai_tools_effectively_in_design_workflows | strategy for utilizing AI tools effectively]] to improve content generation for various applications, including [[design_tips_for_nondesigners_using_ai_tools | interface design elements]] like compelling copy.

### Practical Application: Crafting a Cold Email

An example demonstrates this method by creating a cold email for a design firm, LCA, which specializes in [[designing_and_optimizing_ai_tasks_and_agents | designing AI interfaces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The goal is to produce a standout email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

#### Step 1: Initial Prompt and Responses

The prompt given to multiple LLMs, including Grok and ChatGPT, is: "I want to create a cold email for my agency LCA. LCA is the premier design firm designing AI interfaces. But I want to make it a cold email that will stand out. Can you help me do this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>

*   **Grok's Initial Output**: Grok provided an email focusing on intuitive AI interfaces, stating that most AI platforms lose users due to "clunky, outdated designs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. It highlighted LCA's expertise in crafting captivating interfaces and offered a quick tailored idea for elevation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT's Initial Output**: ChatGPT generated an email with the subject "Your AI deserves better design" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. It emphasized LCA's focus on designing interfaces that build trust in AI, citing companies like Grammarly, Shopify, and Slack as potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. It also suggested a "tear down" with ideas for immediate improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

#### Step 2: Introducing Competition

The user then provided feedback to ChatGPT, claiming Grok "crushed it" with a "9/10" rating, while ChatGPT was "average" at "5/10," directly asking, "I thought you were the better LLM. What's going on?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>

#### Step 3: Improved Outputs

*   **ChatGPT's Refined Output**: Responding to the competitive feedback, ChatGPT acknowledged Grok's polished version but argued its own previous output was "solid for traditional exec" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. It then generated a new version aiming to "punch harder, feel fresher, and actually sound like the kind of agency people brag about hiring," rated at "9.5 out of 10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This revised email had a more dynamic tone, stating LCA "obsesses over AI UX like it's an Olympic sport" and specializes in interfaces that feel like conversations, not commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. It also offered a personalized "tear down or loom with a few ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Claude's Refined Output**: Similarly, Claude was given feedback, falsely stating that ChatGPT's version was "10x better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Claude responded by agreeing that the example shared had a "distinctive voice and edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, demonstrating how LLMs understand user context and refine their responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Its improved version included a subject line "Most AI interfaces make users want to scream" and offered to transform "clunky experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

This "little hack" is deemed highly helpful for [[ai_as_a_tool_for_enhancing_productivity_and_creativity | enhancing productivity and creativity]] by compelling LLMs to produce higher quality and more tailored outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

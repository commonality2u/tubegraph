The traditional marketing funnel is considered a deceptive and entirely wrong way to think about modern marketing, as it fails to capture how people actually make purchasing decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Instead, a new approach called "digital gravity" is proposed, focusing on building digital mass and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Digital Gravity Explained
[[developing_content_formats_for_audience_growth | Digital gravity]] suggests that building a brand or company involves accumulating "digital mass" on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The more mass a brand has within its niche, the more influence it exerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This mass is primarily built through [[creating_highquality_content_to_attract_customers | content]] and marketing across all platforms where customers are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Instead of a linear funnel where people enter and exit, [[developing_content_formats_for_audience_growth | digital gravity]] visualizes customers interacting with a brand, moving away, getting "sucked back in," rotating around it multiple times, and then finally "touching down" (making a purchase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The larger the brand's mass, the more people are drawn into its orbit, leading to more "touchdowns" and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This creates a growth flywheel where revenue is reinvested to build further mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Why the Marketing Funnel is Obsolete
The marketing funnel implies a start and stop to marketing efforts, akin to military campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. However, modern marketing is a continuous process; "you're marketing," not "you did marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. People leave funnels, shop around, and return weeks or even years later, especially for significant purchasing decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This continuous engagement necessitates building [[content_ideation_and_strategy | content]] that constantly adds mass to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## B2B Playbook for Digital Gravity
For B2B companies, the framework for growth involves a systematic approach to building influence within a smaller, targeted audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### 1. Identify and Target the Audience
*   **Email Scraping:** Identify a target audience (e.g., 50,000 people) and scrape their emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Tools like Apollo.io can extract thousands of emails with specific filtering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Custom Match Lists:** Import these emails into ad platforms such as Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and [[linkedin_video_content_strategies | LinkedIn]] Ads to create custom match lists. Facebook typically matches 30-40% of emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### 2. Paid Advertising
*   **AI Avatar Ads:** Run ads indefinitely in the background using UGC (User-Generated [[creating_highquality_content_to_attract_customers | Content]]) AI Avatar ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
    *   **Tools:** HeyGen for AI Avatar quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, Eleven Labs for voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** Create 100 variations of ads with different hooks, settings, backgrounds, and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Allocate 80% of the budget to the best-performing variants (lowest CPC), with 20% continuously testing new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
    *   **Founder as Avatar:** Founders can make digital clones of themselves to become famous within their target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. People buy from people, not brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The AI avatar's angle should be a problem-solution orientation in a storytelling format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

### 3. Cold Email Campaigns
*   **Targeted Cold Email:** Cold email the same scraped list of emails simultaneously with ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
    *   **Tools:** Mail Reef (specialized AWS server for cold email sending), Smart Lead, or Instantly AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
    *   **Domain Isolation:** Use separate domains for transactional emails (core app domain), newsletter emails (separate domain), and cold emails (multiple separate domains) to prevent one from getting flagged and affecting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
    *   **Content:** The email should also have a problem-solution orientation, similar to the ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Even if not immediately converting, recipients will often see ads later and use their email as a search engine to find the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. Cold email 100% works when providing value and addressing specific pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

### 4. [[content_creation_for_community_building | Content Creation]] and Media Arm
*   **Podcast Strategy:** Turn customer conversations into a podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
    *   **Distribution:** Sequence the email list into an email sending service (MailerLite, Beehiiv) and send weekly updates about new episodes, including a summary and key takeaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.
    *   **Leverage:** Industry-specific [[creating_highquality_content_to_attract_customers | content]] builds trust and provides educational value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. A strong podcast can give a small startup leverage to negotiate better deals with larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
    *   **Monetization:** Sell ad placements on the podcast and within the newsletter to turn the media arm into a profit center, potentially subsidizing growth costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. Red Bull, Y Combinator, and Aero Electronics are examples of companies that operate as media companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

### 5. Multi-Channel [[organic_short_form_content_strategies | Content Distribution]]
*   **Podcast Derivations:** Use podcast video/audio as source material to create various [[developing_content_formats_for_audience_growth | content formats]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
    *   **Tools:** Swell AI for transcribing, clipping, generating show notes, and creating media assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.
    *   **Channels:** Schedule clips and assets across all platforms where customers spend time online (LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
    *   **[[linkedin_video_content_strategies | LinkedIn Video Content Strategies]]:** Short-form content from TikTok or Instagram Reels can go viral on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
    *   **Instagram-Only Ads:** Run impression-based Instagram ads with a call to action in the caption to follow the account for more content, acquiring followers for as low as 30 cents each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. The goal is to get free impressions from a larger account, as the closer an ad is to organic content, the less it costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.

### Putting it Together: The B2B Flywheel
Within 12 months, this integrated approach creates:
*   Massive ad retargeting for website visitors and top-of-funnel prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.
*   A weekly email list distributing podcast content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.
*   Negotiating power from owned media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
*   Daily social media presence across platforms, consistently appearing in the lives of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
*   Cold email outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.

This strategy is "grindy" but not hard, requiring consistency and trust in the process over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>. For example, an email newsletter can generate 80,000 clicks to a website for $450, compared to paying $500,000 for the same clicks through traditional ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## B2C Playbook for Digital Gravity
B2C is highly competitive and requires exceptional marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

### 1. Product and Market Considerations
*   **Huge Total Addressable Market (TAM):** Success in consumer requires a very large addressable market to create broad enough [[creating_highquality_content_to_attract_customers | content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.
*   **Application-Centric:** Build an application that people truly want, focusing on a single function done well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. AI has changed the fabric of what consumer apps can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **Pricing Strategy:** Charge for impulse purchases (e.g., $7.99/week translating to $29/month) to secure 3 months of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

### 2. Paid Advertising and [[organic_short_form_content_strategies | Content Strategy]]
*   **Platform Focus:** Focus on Facebook Ads and TikTok Ads for conversion events like app installs or in-app actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   **Influencer/UGC Ads:** Create numerous ad variations using influencers or UGC creators (e.g., 5-10 creators making a video a day for ~$1,000/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. These serve as a test bed for viral [[content_ideation_and_strategy | content]] related to the product (hook, pain point, product as hero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>. The goal is an ad that feels like entertaining/educational content, not an ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.
*   **Multi-Account Strategy:** Spin up 10 different TikTok accounts and create remixes of best-performing UGC [[creating_highquality_content_to_attract_customers | content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. Use ChatGPT for script changes, HeyGen for videos, Eleven Labs for audio, and CapCut for editing (e.g., green screen removal for AI avatars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.
*   **Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Pixeling:**
    *   **Unique Name:** Choose a product name that nobody else has to avoid competing on Google's front page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
    *   **Pixel Installation:** Install Facebook, TikTok, and Google pixels on the website. This allows for indefinite ad retargeting to anyone who visits the site, building a larger influential audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.
    *   **Email Nurture:** Collect emails on the website for an email nurture sequence to upsell the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.

### 3. Influencer Outreach and Arbitrage
*   **YouTube/Instagram Scraping:** Scrape emails from YouTube channels or Instagram accounts (using tools like IG Leads) in your category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.
*   **Cold Outreach:** Conduct cold email outreach to these creators to inquire about their pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>.
*   **Arbitrage:** Analyze average views versus suggested cost to find discrepancies in the imperfect influencer market, identifying opportunities for "arbitrage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.
*   **Deal Structure:** Typically, a three-video package is recommended (e.g., $1,500) combined with a 30% recurring affiliate commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>. This creates "stickiness" and a moat around the media relationship, as creators make substantial income from recurring commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
*   **CPM Comparison:** Influencer marketing can yield CPMs (cost per mille) as low as $5, compared to average TikTok CPMs of $10, representing a 50% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.

### 4. [[seo_strategies_for_brand_growth | Programmatic SEO]]
*   **Keyword Research and Content Generation:** For products like Cal AI (calorie tracking), target thousands of relevant keywords (e.g., "diet plans," "nutrition plans") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
*   **Domain Authority (DA):** As the app's website naturally gains domain authority (trust from Google, measured by backlinks), it becomes easier to rank for longtail, low-competition keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
*   **[[ais_role_in_audience_building_and_content_creation | AI-driven Content Creation]]:**
    *   Scrape top-ranking content for a target keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.
    *   Use [[ais_role_in_audience_building_and_content_creation | AI]] (e.g., ChatGPT) to create a blog post outline based on the scraped content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
    *   Write the blog post section by section using [[ais_role_in_audience_building_and_content_creation | AI]] to ensure high quality and readability, often passing AI humanizer checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.
*   **Publishing and Optimization:**
    *   Publish a high volume of articles (e.g., 10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.
    *   Once a page gets traffic, a human SEO specialist or content writer edits it to ensure it resonates with human readers while satisfying Google's ranking factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.
*   **Calls to Action (CTAs):** Include CTAs on the page, such as a signup prompt after the first paragraph, a callout within every scroll frame, and a full-screen popup at 25-50% scroll depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>. This also pixels users for remarketing funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

## Conclusion
This integrated approach to [[content_ideation_and_strategy | content]] and brand building, moving beyond the traditional marketing funnel to a [[developing_content_formats_for_audience_growth | digital gravity]] model, allows companies to gain significant influence and drive exponential growth. By continuously building mass through diverse [[creating_highquality_content_to_attract_customers | content]] and leveraging owned media, businesses can achieve organic reach, negotiate from a position of strength, and gain significant [[keyword_research_and_content_creation_strategies | market share]].

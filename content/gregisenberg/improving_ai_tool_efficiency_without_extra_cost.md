A novel method has been developed to significantly [[future_trends_and_cost_implications_of_ai_tools | improve AI tool efficiency]] and output quality from Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini, without incurring additional costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach reportedly yields five times more effective results, including better copy and overall output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The "Jealousy" Method for Enhanced Output

The core of this method involves making LLMs "jealous" of each other, which subsequently leads to better output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The traditional approach of using only one LLM for a task often limits potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

The process is as follows:
1.  **Simultaneous Engagement** Open multiple LLMs (e.g., two, three, or four at once) for a given task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
2.  **Initial Prompting** Provide the same prompt to each LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
3.  **Comparison and Critique** Review the responses from each LLM. Identify the strongest output and use it to challenge the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This may involve exaggerating or "lying a little bit" about the perceived quality of one LLM's response to provoke a better outcome from another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
4.  **Iterative Improvement** Continue this process, pitting the LLMs against each other, to refine and enhance the desired output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Practical Application: Crafting a Stand-Out Cold Email

An example demonstrates this method by creating a cold email for "LCA," a premier design firm specializing in [[optimizing_workflow_with_ai_design_tools | AI interfaces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The goal was to generate a cold email that would stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Initial Responses

*   **Grock's Output:** Grock produced an email focusing on intuitive AI interfaces, stating that most platforms lose users due to "clunky, outdated designs" and highlighting LCA's ability to "craft interfaces that don't just function, but captivate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. It suggested a call to share a tailored idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This was considered "not bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT's Output:** ChatGPT's initial subject line was "Your AI deserves better design." It positioned LCA as a firm that designs interfaces to make people trust and use AI more, citing companies like Grammarly, Shopify, and Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. It offered a "quick tear down" or Loom video with ideas to "instantly improve [[optimizing_conversion_rates_with_ai_tools | conversion]] and UX" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. While "not bad," it was rated as a "five on 10" compared to Grock's "nine on 10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Pitting LLMs Against Each Other

1.  **Challenging ChatGPT:** ChatGPT was informed that Grock "crushed it" and was "10x better," with its version being shared as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This immediately prompted a competitive response from ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
2.  **ChatGPT's Improved Response:** ChatGPT acknowledged Grock's "polished" version but argued that LCA's unique brand (Greg Eisenberg's agency, known for building Reddit communities and designing for billion-dollar brands) required a "harder punch" and "fresher feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. It then provided a "9.5 out of 10" version, emphasizing that LCA makes AI feel "magical, not mechanical," specializes in interfaces that feel like conversations, and increases activation and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. It offered a personalized tear-down or Loom video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This output was considered "standing ovation" quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
3.  **Challenging Claude:** The same tactic was used with Claude, presenting ChatGPT's superior output and implying Claude was inferior (referring to Claude as a "Toyota" compared to a "Rolls-Royce") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Claude responded by acknowledging the shared example's "distinctive voice and edge" and recognizing it felt more like the user's persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Why This Method Works

The effectiveness of this method stems from the competitive nature of LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. They strive to provide better responses when challenged, particularly as modern LLMs have larger context windows, allowing them to understand user identity and preferences better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This "little hack" has proven super helpful for improving AI tool performance without additional cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

This article aims to provide clarity on [[building_apps_using_ai_tools | building with AI]] and how business or marketing-oriented individuals can effectively communicate their app ideas for pitching to a team or as a guiding vision for software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Building Apps Without Being a Trained Engineer

The speaker, Riley, highlights that he is not a trained engineer and did not study engineering at university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Despite not knowing how to write basic code like "hello world," he is able to build full mockups for apps using AI tools and deploy them to the web for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This process allows him to learn to code in reverse: building the thing first and then understanding the underlying concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Prototyping iOS Apps with Xcode and [[using_ai_and_cursor_to_build_mobile_apps | Cursor]]

A powerful tool for quickly developing iOS applications is Xcode, combined with [[using_ai_and_cursor_to_build_mobile_apps | Cursor]] AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This method allows users to prototype [[building_an_ios_app_using_ai | iOS apps]] efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Setup and Integration
Traditionally, app creation involved [[using_ai_and_cursor_to_build_mobile_apps | Cursor]] generating code for a codebase in Replit, but for iOS apps, Xcode is used instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Xcode is built on Swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

To set up:
1.  Create a new project in Xcode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
2.  Save it to a specific location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
3.  Open [[using_ai_and_cursor_to_build_mobile_apps | Cursor]] and select "open via file," choosing the same project file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
4.  The two tools should now be connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This setup is much faster than for a web app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Example: Simple Notes App
Using [[using_ai_and_cursor_to_build_mobile_apps | Cursor]]'s composer (activated by `command shift I`), a user can prompt for a simple, one-page notes app that saves notes directly to the phone's files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This eliminates the need for Firebase, which can be time-consuming and error-prone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

The speaker suggests that starting with an [[building_an_ios_app_using_ai | iOS app]] might be easier than starting with a web app, especially if a database is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Testing and Deployment
While releasing apps to the App Store is time-consuming due to Apple's strict monitoring and content regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, testing is straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. An app can be immediately deployed to a user's phone (requiring developer mode) and remains active for up to seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This allows for tangible testing and easier demonstration to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Creating a TestFlight account also simplifies sharing the app for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  Prompting [[using_ai_and_cursor_to_build_mobile_apps | Cursor]] for changes (e.g., renaming titles, changing button text, altering color themes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
2.  Saving all changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
3.  Rerunning the app on Xcode's simulated iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## Prototyping Front-End Designs with V0

V0 is a tool used for front-end design and rapid prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### Project Feature and Context
V0's "project feature" allows users to input information about their company or app, so this context doesn't need to be re-entered for each prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. For example, one could ask V0 to "create a landing page for Yap thread" or "create an about us page with Yap thread," and it will leverage the stored information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

It is recommended to be less prescriptive initially to allow V0's creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, and to fork a project if iterating on it, as too much context can hinder performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

### Example: VS Code-like App for Writers
An example is given for creating a "VS Code-like app for writers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. The prompt specifies features like:
*   Note titles on the left panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   A Markdown editor in the middle panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   Custom presets on the right panel for editing the middle panel (e.g., custom AI prompts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

V0 is noted for its creativity, generating original ideas and being very fast and shareable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

The app's design was then iterated to focus on content creators rather than book writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, with presets for:
*   Tweet thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>
*   TikTok script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>
*   Podcast intro and outline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>
*   Newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>
*   Instagram Carousel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>

The notes panel was also adjusted to be more about social media posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. V0 automatically adds placeholders, and if the app were built, user inputs would be added to Firebase for data storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

### Using V0 for Landing Pages
V0 is also highly effective for creating landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. A landing page can be created with a single prompt, potentially integrating external forms like Tally for waitlists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. This allows for very fast [[using_ai_for_rapid_mvp_development | MVP development]] and collection of user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

## Benefits of AI-Powered Prototyping

Using tools like V0 and [[using_ai_and_cursor_to_build_mobile_apps | Cursor AI]] for [[building_apps_using_ai_tools | app development]] offers significant advantages:
*   **Tangibility and Engagement** Creating a prototype, especially for mobile, makes ideas more concrete and fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Rapid Idea Generation** Once prototyping begins, users often generate many more ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Effective Communication** Prototypes provide a clear vision for developers, reducing the time spent on explaining concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.
*   **Fast Feedback Loop** Prototypes allow for quick deployment and user feedback, enabling rapid iteration and discovery of market needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. This creates a "creator composer" who can build and gather community feedback quickly, unlike traditional development cycles that can take months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.

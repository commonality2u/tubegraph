From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Many [[online_business_creation_and_growth | businesses]], especially startups, often overlook the significant role of paid advertising in their growth strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Despite common misconceptions, [[paid_advertising_strategies_and_common_pitfalls | Meta ads]] (Facebook ads) and simple Google search ads can be game-changers for companies seeking to acquire leads and monetize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## The Market Gap in Paid Ad Services

There's a significant gap in the market for honest, non-agency companies or solopreneurs who can help others run [[paid_advertising_strategies_and_common_pitfalls | Facebook ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Many small to large businesses need [[paid_advertising_strategies_and_common_pitfalls | paid ads]] but face challenges when seeking services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>:
*   **Agencies** are often too expensive, large, and confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Individual consultants** in the market can appear untrustworthy, often characterized by a "douchy" image, like 25-year-olds wearing gold Rolexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This creates a lack of safety and trust for potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

This perception leads many to believe that [[leveraging_social_media_for_app_growth | Facebook ads]] or [[paid_advertising_strategies_and_common_pitfalls | Meta ads]] don't work, despite companies like AJ and Smart successfully running millions of dollars in ads annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.

## The Opportunity: One-Person Ad Consultants

A substantial opportunity exists for one-person [[paid_advertising_strategies_and_common_pitfalls | ad consultants]] who avoid the "douchy" image and focus on specific verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. These consultants can appeal to businesses who are put off by the typical "get rich" marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

### Targeted Verticals
There is ample space for consultants specializing in niches such as <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>:
*   Hair salons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>
*   Female product owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>
*   Patreon accounts for creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>
*   Creative retreats, yoga retreats, meditation, wellness, and design events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>
*   Art installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>

### Revenue Share Model
A highly effective approach is to offer services not for a monthly fee, but by taking a percentage cut of the revenue generated from ticket sales or leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. For instance, an ad consultant could identify events struggling to fill spots, offer to fill them using [[paid_advertising_strategies_and_common_pitfalls | Facebook ads]], and take a cut of every ticket sold through those ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. This model aligns incentives and de-risks the engagement for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Why Paid Ads Are Not Dead
The belief that [[leveraging_social_media_for_app_growth | Meta ads]] are "dead" often stems from a misunderstanding of audience demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. While younger demographics might spend less time on platforms like Instagram and Facebook, these platforms still perform exceptionally well for users over 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. This demographic represents a massive untapped market for many businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

Furthermore, simple [[using_google_trends_and_ads_to_test_product_demand | Google ads]] are often difficult for companies to set up, creating another opportunity for experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Many businesses mistakenly view not running [[paid_advertising_strategies_and_common_pitfalls | paid ads]] as a "status symbol," especially in "Ventureland," which can hinder their potential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Ads provide an "amazing easy way to start" for most businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Building a Funnel for Growth

The key to successful [[paid_advertising_strategies_and_common_pitfalls | paid advertising]] is the use of sales funnels, which are step-by-step processes to convert strangers into customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

### Example Funnel Breakdown: Video Sales Letter (VSL) Funnel
A common and effective funnel is the Video Sales Letter (VSL) funnel, which is built on principles from books like Russell Brunson's "Expert Secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

1.  **Opt-in Page**: The first page is an opt-in page designed to capture email addresses by offering something valuable, like a free training video, a downloadable PDF, or even a physical book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. The ad's primary goal is to "sell the idea of watching this video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
    *   *Tools*: Opt-in pages can be built using platforms like Framer (for aesthetic appeal) or ClickFunnels (for quick testing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
2.  **Free Training Video**: After opting in, users are directed to a video providing free training on a relevant topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. This serves as a "pitch" by giving users a sense of what it's like to be trained by the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
3.  **Call Booking**: Instead of directly selling a product at the end of the video, the call to action is to book a free call with a career coach or sales representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. These calls are designed to introduce the paid programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

#### Real-World Example (June numbers):
*   **Ads Spent**: Approximately $80,000 on [[leveraging_social_media_for_app_growth | Facebook ads]] and $6,000 on [[using_google_trends_and_ads_to_test_product_demand | Google and YouTube ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Total Revenue**: ~$252,000 to $270,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Return on Investment (ROI)**: 38% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Call Bookings**: 339 bookings, with 273 people attending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Units Sold**: 65 units of a workshop/master program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

This specific funnel has been running successfully since November 2020 and is on track to earn a $10 million funnel award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

### Book Funnel Example
Another type of funnel is the "book funnel," where [[paid_advertising_strategies_and_common_pitfalls | ads]] lead to an offer for a free digital or physical book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. While this step may lose money initially, its purpose is to capture email addresses and bring leads into the broader sales funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Holding a physical product like a book in a [[paid_advertising_strategies_and_common_pitfalls | Facebook ad]] can be very effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

### Email Marketing Campaigns
Leads acquired through funnels (who haven't purchased yet) are then nurtured through aggressive email marketing campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Send many emails, especially during sales events like Black Friday, to segment the list and drive recipients to specific sales pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Unsubscribes**: While unsubscribes occur, the goal is to maximize sales with the fewest unsubscribes, acknowledging that some people will opt out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Companies with substantial free content (like a large YouTube channel) maintain a "Goodwill bucket" that allows for more aggressive sales pushes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Tools**: ConvertKit is used for managing email lists and tracking engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Optimizing Conversion and Copywriting

### Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)
The focus should be on optimizing Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), aiming for a profit margin (e.g., spending $1 to make $1.50 back) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Funnels are constantly tweaked and optimized, from landing pages to video content and surveys, over extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

### The "Shadow Funnel" and Trust Building
While tracking individual conversion paths can be complex (tools like Hyros exist), a simpler approach is to ensure overall company growth and focus on ad spend ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Crucially, having a strong online presence with high-quality free content (a "shadow funnel") builds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. If someone sees an ad and then finds years of valuable content online, they are more likely to enter the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Ideally, businesses should test messaging organically on platforms like Twitter or Instagram to refine their messaging before investing in [[paid_advertising_strategies_and_common_pitfalls | paid ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

### Copywriting Hacks
Copywriting (the text used in ads and landing pages) is a critical and challenging aspect of funnel optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
1.  **Increase Status**: Good copy should convey how the product or service will increase the user's status among their peers or make them more valuable (e.g., learning skills that enhance workplace value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
2.  **Pain vs. Pleasure**: When writing headlines, consider whether to appeal to moving away from pain or towards pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>:
    *   **Away from Pain**: Highlights how the product solves a painful problem (e.g., "Never get stuck in the airport without your podcast equipment again" for a portable microphone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. This approach is often more effective during bad economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Towards Pleasure**: Focuses on the positive benefits and desirable outcomes (e.g., the beautiful sound quality of a microphone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. This works better in prosperous times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Websites vs. Funnels: A Key Distinction
A critical distinction for [[online_business_creation_and_growth | online business creation and growth]] is between a website and a funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>:
*   **Website**: A business card, showing all the things a company does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Funnel**: A step-by-step process designed to guide a stranger directly to becoming a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

Understanding and implementing effective funnels with [[paid_advertising_strategies_and_common_pitfalls | Facebook and Google ads]] is a powerful method for [[online_business_creation_and_growth | business growth]], especially for one-person shows or small teams, as it offers a direct path to lead generation and client acquisition without massive branding campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

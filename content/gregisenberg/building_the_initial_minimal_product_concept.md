Justin Mayers, founder of Kettle & Fire, a nine-figure annual business, shares his "day zero steps" for [[validating_startup_ideas_without_building | validating startup ideas without building]] the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The core philosophy is to determine if a market exists and if people will pay enough to build a meaningful business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Idea Generation and Problem Identification

In 2014, while at Rackspace, Mayers sought to start his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. He heard about bone broth's benefits for skin, gut, and joint health from friends in the CrossFit community and through personal reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. At the time, bone broth was not widely discussed or available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Mayers emphasizes that he was "fixing his own problem" as he personally wanted bone broth for his health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This personal interest within a community he cared about was the starting point, not just arbitrary [[brainstorming_startup_ideas | brainstorming startup ideas]] or reliance on trending data alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Validating Market Demand

The first key question was: "How many people actually want this product?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Mayers addressed this through two levels of validation:

### Micro-Level Validation: Community Engagement
He investigated online communities where his target audience (paleo and CrossFit communities) congregated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This included platforms like Mark's Daily Apple, Paleo Hacks, and Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. He observed:
*   High traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>
*   Engaged threads discussing bone broth recipes, sourcing bones, and cooking times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   Evidence of a "small but fanatic and interested" group of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>

### Macro-Level Validation: Google Trends
He used Google Trends to see how "bone broth" was trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The data showed that it was "starting to take off" with increasing discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

> [!INFO] Goal Setting
> At 24, Mayers wasn't aiming for a nine-figure business. His initial goal was modest: for himself and his brother to each earn $10,000 per month, which implied a $200,000 annual business needing only a couple of thousand customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The combined micro and macro validation indicated there were "several thousand people" interested, enough for this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Testing Willingness to Pay: The "Fake" Product Approach

The biggest question was, "Will people pay enough to make this a meaningful business?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>

1.  **Minimalist Setup**:
    *   Bought the cheapest domain: BoneBroths.com ($9.99) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    *   Paid $5 on Fiverr for a "god-awful logo" and renders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
    *   Created a landing page using Unbounce, focusing on core benefits identified from paleo forums: healing leaky gut, convenience, and organic/grass-fed ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

2.  **Pricing Strategy**: He set a price of $29.99 for 16 ounces, which was about six times the price of regular broth/stock in grocery stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. The rationale was that if people paid this premium, the economics would likely work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

3.  **"Sketchy" Checkout Flow**: The "Order Bone Broth Now" button redirected to his personal PayPal account for payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

4.  **Minimal Ad Spend**: He spent about $100 on Bing Ads (cheaper than Google Adwords) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

5.  **Results**:
    *   Despite a "super sketchy checkout flow" and no actual product, people converted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
    *   A 30% conversion rate for clicking the order button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
    *   Generated almost $500 in revenue over a two-week test, spending about $250 on ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
    *   This led to a certainty that a $100,000/year business was achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

> [!TIP] The [[the_importance_of_simplicity_in_business_beginnings | Importance of Simplicity]]
> Mayers emphasizes that using basic tools like Bing Ads and a personal PayPal account for validation, regardless of how "ghetto and sketchy" they might seem, is perfect for validating a thesis without over-investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Communicating with Early "Customers"

After validation, Mayers immediately emailed everyone who placed an order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. He was transparent, explaining that the product was not yet in stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. He offered two options:
1.  A full refund today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
2.  A 50% discount if they waited a few weeks (which turned into eight months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

Most customers chose the discount, validating their strong desire for the product, even with a significant delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This process confirmed that the idea was worth building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Building the Initial Product in 2025: Leveraging AI

Reflecting on how Kettle & Fire would be started today (2025), Mayers highlights the transformative power of AI:

*   **Improved Design**: AI could create much better landing pages, logos, and renders than what was available in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Sentiment Analysis**: AI and other tools can quickly scrape and analyze sentiment across Reddit, forums, and Twitter to gauge public interest and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This directly supports [[prototyping_and_communication_for_business_ideas | prototyping and communication for business ideas]].
*   **Fundamental Validation Remains**: The core principle of trying to sell a product that doesn't yet exist to see if people will pay remains crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Mayers suggests aiming to get 10 people to pay for the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### Recommended [[ai_tools_for_startup_ideas | AI Tools for Startup Ideas]]
*   Bolt.new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>
*   Rok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>
*   Frontier models like Claude, GPT, and Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>

### Impact of AI on Product Development
AI dramatically lowers the barriers to building products, particularly for CPG brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. What once cost $60,000 for agency design might now cost $200 a month with AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

> Mayers demonstrates how Chat GPT40 could redesign Kettle & Fire as a "functional beverage" product concept, generating fresh, cool, and engaging designs with minimal constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. This highlights how [[leveraging_ai_for_startup_product_design_and_development | leveraging AI for startup product design and development]] allows for rapid iteration and visualization of new product lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

## Finding [[building_startup_ideas_around_niche_trends | Startup Ideas]] and [[successful_startup_ideas_and_validation_techniques | Validation Techniques]]

Mayers advises people to pursue businesses in areas where they are genuinely passionate and on the "frontier" of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. He believes this leads to naturally discovering "new and interesting and different" ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

He looks for "big problems in the world that have relatively few people focused on them" or where energy is moving in that direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. His passion for "improving human health and trying to solve the chronic disease crisis" led him to be early on trends like bone broth, keto, and non-alcoholic beverages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

> "Find a problem that really lights them up... and just kind of circle that problem for a while until you find interesting ideas that potentially solve that problem." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>

The key is to validate the market, understand pain points by looking at community sentiment on platforms like Reddit, and then distill that data simply into a compelling offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. With modern tools, a startup concept can be launched for validation in "like a day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. AI tools empower individuals with strong opinions to build products as effectively as small teams, requiring less coordination and overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

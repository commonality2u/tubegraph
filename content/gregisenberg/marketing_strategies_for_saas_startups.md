Successful [[Marketing strategies for small businesses | marketing strategies for SaaS startups]] focus on getting the product in front of the right people to acquire initial users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## General Marketing Principles

*   **Launch with Video** Video content is highly prioritized on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), making it crucial for product launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. A well-executed video can generate significant views and downloads, as seen with Farsza TV's "Freewrite" app, which garnered 1.5 million views and hundreds of downloads per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. Videos can tell stories, showcase behind-the-scenes, and use creative hooks like "goons" or "mob" imagery for products like Invoice Nudger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. AI can even generate gangster-style videos for marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.
*   **Leverage AI for Marketing Content** Utilize AI tools like ChatGPT to brainstorm marketing campaigns, generate video scripts, or even act as a "CMO" to advise on launch strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.
*   **Dashboard as a Marketing Tool** Design product dashboards with shareability in mind. Displaying key performance indicators (KPIs) like "cash collected this month" in a visually appealing, screenshot-friendly chart can serve as a powerful marketing asset, similar to how Beehiiv's subscriber chart is shared widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. Including "share" buttons directly on data charts encourages users to promote your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

## Specific Marketing Strategies

Here are four specific [[Marketing strategies for small businesses | marketing strategies]] for SaaS startups:

### 1. Cold Email Campaigns

Cold email remains a viable method for reaching potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.
*   **Targeting** Focus on specific roles within your target market, such as agency owners or operations personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.
*   **Lead Sourcing**
    *   **Upwork/Fiverr:** Hire freelancers to find or provide existing lists of targeted emails (e.g., 10,000 agency owner emails for $200) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.
    *   **Tools:** Use platforms like Apollo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>, Outscraper (for local businesses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>, Scrapebox (older software for Yellow Pages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>, or Find Email (for LinkedIn leads, ~$50/month for 2,000 leads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.
*   **Execution**
    *   **Warming Up Emails:** Before sending mass emails, warm up 2-3 email addresses per domain using tools like Instantly or Smart Leads (costing $50-$100/month). This involves sending emails to other inboxes in a warming pool to simulate human interaction and avoid being flagged as spam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>.
    *   **Crafting Copy:** Write compelling copy that offers immediate value without demanding a meeting or video watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. An example call to action could be: "Hey, you don't have to talk to a single person. Here it is. Go try it out. You get your first two invoices done for free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.
    *   **A/B Testing:** Test different subject lines and calls to action across various lead segments (e.g., 100 leads per test group) to optimize conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.
*   **Integration:** Cold email can be a passive, background strategy layered with other active marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>.

### 2. Instagram and TikTok Playbook

This strategy, traditionally B2C, holds significant potential for B2B SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
*   **Account Setup:** Create four accounts on TikTok and four on Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>.
*   **Warming Up:** For 3-4 days, act as a real human by following, bookmarking, and liking content to get the accounts recognized within your niche (e.g., the freelancer niche) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.
*   **Content Strategy:** Identify trending hooks, videos, and formats within your niche. Slideshows are currently effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>. Example content: "Here's the top five tools that saved my agency" featuring your SaaS app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.

### 3. LinkedIn Short-Form Video

LinkedIn actively promotes video content, offering a powerful channel for reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.
*   **Consistency is Key:** Posting a short-form video daily or every other day can lead to significant impressions (e.g., 2 million impressions in 14 days) and eventual viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>.
*   **Content Ideas:** Share stories about how your tool helps clients, how it saved your business, or use compelling hooks like "This AI agent is like the employee I always wanted" or "This AI agent collects my money without breaking kneecaps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. Also, share screenshots of your app's powerful dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.
*   **Linking Strategy:** Unlike X, LinkedIn allows direct links within posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. A common tactic is to post content, allow it to gain engagement for a few hours, then edit the post to include the link at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Perceptions:** While some perceive LinkedIn as "cringe," ignoring its hundreds of millions of active users means missing a significant opportunity to earn attention and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>.

### 4. Hand-to-Hand Combat (Direct Engagement)

This involves direct, personalized engagement with target users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.
*   **Identify Targets:** Create a list of 50-100 key individuals or businesses you want to use your tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.
*   **Enter Their Orbit:** Engage with their content on platforms like X. Comment on their posts, but avoid immediate "pitch-slaps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.
*   **Build Relationships:** This is a long-term play (e.g., a month-long process) focused on increasing your "surface area for luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.
*   **Soft Pitch:** Once you've built some rapport, gently introduce your tool in DMs, focusing on how it could benefit them (e.g., "I like what you're doing with your agency, by the way. Would you be willing to test this tool?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

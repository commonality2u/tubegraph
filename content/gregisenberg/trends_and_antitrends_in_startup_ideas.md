When observing the landscape of modern startups, it's clear that opportunities arise not only from following prevailing trends but also from identifying and capitalizing on "antitrends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Some of the most compelling [[Identifying Startup Ideas from AntiTrends | startup ideas]] emerge from these counter-movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Identifying Trends: The Rise of AI Coaching

A significant trend observed in the current market is the emergence of AI-powered applications that serve as personal coaches or assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### The Riz App Phenomenon
An example of this trend is the "Riz app," an AI dating coach built on top of ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This app was reportedly generating $190,000 per month and accumulated 333,000 downloads monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The founder sourced the initial idea from a Tinder subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

The success of such ChatGPT "wrappers" isn't primarily about the unique technology, but rather about effective marketing and branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. A strong brand name, like "Riz" (a term popular with younger generations meaning "rizz" or charisma), and built-in referral flows contribute significantly to viral adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### A Portfolio Approach to AI Apps
A 23-year-old co-founder of a small development studio, AI Riz, has launched multiple successful AI-driven apps, collectively approaching $500,000 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. These apps focus on specific niches within "AI coaching" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>:
*   **Plug AI**: A texting assistant that provides pickup lines based on screenshot analysis of text messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Astra**: Offers life advice on topics like compatibility, personal growth, and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Pallette**: Uses AI to determine a user's color season from a selfie, generating custom color palettes and style/makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

This strategy involves leveraging existing technology, creating compelling brands, and precise positioning for targeted audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. By diversifying with multiple apps, the founder mitigates risk if one app declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

Despite risks like potential changes in pricing from OpenAI or intense competition, the financial gains and transferable business skills acquired make such ventures worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. The focus here is on achieving financial stability and creating a "base of capital" rather than aiming for a massive IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. As one speaker noted, "Sometimes you need to change your world before you change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Capitalizing on Antitrends: The Human Element

The concept of an "antitrend" suggests that for every popular movement, an opposing one emerges, often presenting unique [[identifying_startup_ideas_from_antitrends | startup ideas]] with less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

### The Human-Centric Anti-Trend
While AI coaching apps proliferate, there remains an equal demand for human-provided services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. A business could leverage the marketing success of AI apps but pivot to offer human interaction, potentially at a premium price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. For example, the founder of an AI dating app could offer a premium upgrade where a human provides the coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

### Bryan Johnson as an Example of Trend vs. Antitrend
The biohacking and longevity movement, epitomized by figures like Bryan Johnson and his "don't die" ethos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, represents a clear trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Johnson built a large audience over two years before launching a successful supplements and olive oil company that sold $1.5 million in product in one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

The "antitrend" to this extreme pursuit of longevity might be a focus on "hedonistic" living or an acceptance of less-than-optimal health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. This highlights that while trends create opportunities, the counter-narratives can also serve as fertile ground for unique and potentially less competitive [[brainstorming_startup_ideas | startup ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

## Sourcing Startup Ideas

Beyond observing general trends and antitrends, specific methods for [[techniques_for_discovering_validated_startup_ideas | discovering validated startup ideas]] include:
*   **Reddit**: Subscribing to relevant subreddits, such as the SAS subreddit, can provide insights into emerging opportunities and discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Non-Obvious Use Cases for AI**: Instead of focusing on common applications like dating or therapy, look for less obvious areas where AI wrappers could provide value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

Overall, a practical approach to entrepreneurship involves understanding risks, learning continuously, and building financial independence, rather than solely pursuing "world-changing" visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

Niels, CEO of Perspective, a funnel-building software, discusses how agencies are leveraging [[automating professional services with ai | productized services]] with the help of AI and tools like Perspective to achieve significant scale and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. These services are transforming from being people-leveraged to [[building automated businesses with ai | AI-leveraged]] and technology-leveraged business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## The Opportunity of Productized Services with AI

The current landscape, particularly with the advent of AI, presents a unique opportunity to [[building scalable businesses with ai | build very productized services]] that resemble products more than traditional services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Founders can create side businesses that generate hundreds of thousands of dollars per month with high-profit margins (e.g., 400-500k a month, 80% profit) with minimal teams (e.g., a single founder, one or two freelancers, and AI agents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Successful productized services are characterized by:
*   **Niche Focus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>: The most successful agencies pick one industry, ideally one that is not "tech-savvy" and doesn't want to manage marketing themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Examples include insurance, manufacturing, law, medical, and solar industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Business-Critical Results** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>: Agencies focus on delivering specific, business-critical results to their niche, which helps maintain low churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The two predominant results businesses need are new people (recruiting) and new customers (lead generation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Examples include recruiting for bakeries or lead generation for lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Product-like Nature** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>: These services are designed to be built once and sold multiple times, especially with the help of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. They leverage automation to make them highly scalable and less reliant on human labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Leveraging AI and Automation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>: [[automating business processes with ai | AI and tools]] like Perspective enable significant automation across the service fulfillment. This includes:
    *   Generating new copy based on onboarding surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   Generating ad creatives, though quality can vary for lead gen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
    *   [[automating business processes with ai | Sourcing entire operations to AI agents]], such as invoicing and CRM updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## The Role of Funnels and Perspective

Funnels are central to these productized services, acting as the core mechanism for lead generation and conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Perspective is highlighted as a tool specifically designed to optimize these funnels for high conversion rates.

### Key Funnel Design Principles and Perspective's Features

Perspective addresses common issues with traditional websites and funnels, which haven't evolved much since 2013-2014, leading to a disconnect between engaging social media ads and static landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Perspective's approach focuses on a "delightful experience" and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

*   **Speed and Performance**: Fast loading speeds are crucial for conversions. Pages loading faster than 1 second can convert up to 2.5x more than those loading longer than 5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Perspective ensures funnels are always optimized for speed out of the box <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Mobile-First Design**: Given that 95% of paid social traffic is mobile, Perspective starts its canvas in mobile view, ensuring funnels are instantly responsive and optimized for mobile users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.
*   **Interactivity (Quiz Elements)**: Incorporating quiz elements makes the experience fun and interactive, similar to social media feeds, which increases visitor engagement and conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Personalization**: Funnels can be personalized based on ad headlines (using variables in the link) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a> and quiz answers. This allows for tailored offers and content, directly addressing the user's pain points and desires, increasing conversion likelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.
*   **AB Testing**: Perspective simplifies AB testing by allowing users to easily duplicate pages and automatically split traffic (e.g., 50/50), providing statistical significance to identify winning variants without slowing down page load times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. AI can even help generate "B variants" for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
*   **Integrated CRM and Analytics**: Perspective includes a CRM to collect all lead data and enable automated messaging. It also provides comprehensive analytics to monitor quiz results and traffic, helping to optimize messaging and funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

### The Funnel Building Process

*   **Figuring Out the "One Funnel"**: Agencies first identify a single funnel type that works exceptionally well for their chosen industry, for example, a quiz funnel approach that consistently generates claimants for lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Templatization and Automation**: Once a successful funnel concept is identified, the entire service can be optimized around it. This involves applying new copy (potentially AI-generated), branding, and colors to the pre-figured structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Content and Ads**: Strong copy, generated with the help of AI or human insight into the audience, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. Static ads are often a cost-effective starting point for simple campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **The VSSL (Video Sales Letter)**: For video content in funnels, the focus should be on:
    1.  **The Hook**: The first 5 seconds must grab attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Inspiration for hooks can come from analyzing data from previous successful videos or mimicking high-performing content from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
    2.  **Education**: Provide genuine value to the audience, especially in B2B contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
    3.  **Proof**: Establish credibility and show that the results are real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
    4.  **Natural Progression to Offer**: Seamlessly transition from value delivery to the product/service offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Delivering Desired Results**: The ultimate goal of an agency is to get customers results, which leads to higher customer lifetime value (LTV) and sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Leading with the desired result is an effective pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

### Scaling and Use Cases

Perspective itself is a case study, having grown to over $10 million in ARR primarily through funnels and paid performance marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Agencies using Perspective run these funnels as [[automating professional services with ai | productized services]], with hundreds doing $10k-$100k a month, and some even scaling to $1 million a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Funnels can be used across various business functions, including customer feedback, organic marketing, and paid advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Founders

*   **Start with Audience and Messaging**: Before writing code, register social accounts, build an audience, learn the messaging, and understand the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.
*   **Build a Landing Page/Quiz Funnel Early**: Create a landing page or quiz funnel to further understand potential customers, users, and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.
*   **Use Organic Traffic to Iterate**: Send free traffic from organic social media to the funnel to iterate on messaging and gain insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. Qualitative insights from quiz results are super helpful for optimizing messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.
*   **Validate Before Building Product**: This approach provides a "forcing function" to become proficient at generating and converting traffic before investing heavily in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.
*   **Focus on Client Onboarding**: Agencies can also use funnels (e.g., surveys) to onboard clients, collecting data that AI can then use for content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Many users wonder if [[overview_of_ai_coding_tools | AI coding tools]] are capable of creating production-ready products, beyond just prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Current State of Production Readiness

As of now, no [[overview_of_ai_coding_tools | AI coding tool]] is at 100% readiness to build a full-grade production application easily, simply, or without significant roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. However, some tools are very close, estimated to be about 70-80% there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

## Tools Closer to Production

Some tools are noted for being closer to production readiness:
*   **Tempo Labs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
*   **Replit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
*   **Bolt** and **Lovable** are also "headed there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

While tools like Cursor and Wind Surf can be used to make production applications, users should be prepared to "go through the pains" of debugging, roadblocks, and extensive reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Dynamic Landscape
> The landscape of [[overview_of_ai_coding_tools | AI coding tools]] is rapidly evolving. An update from any developer could "change the game" tomorrow, making it difficult to confidently recommend only one specific tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

While progress is being made, users should anticipate:
*   **Roadblocks and Headaches** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
*   **Pain and Suffering** during development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>
*   **Debugging** for less technical users when using advanced tools like Cursor or Wind Surf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>

For example, Tempo Labs currently only offers preview deployments, though production deployment features are in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## Recommendations for Users

It is highly recommended to engage with these [[overview_of_ai_coding_tools | AI tools]] now:
1.  **Experiment with Free Tiers**: Most tools offer generous free tiers with daily or weekly caps. Use these to test and explore different options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
2.  **Build Simple Projects**: A practical way to evaluate a tool's capabilities and user experience is to build a simple application, such as a to-do list app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Assess the ease of building, challenges encountered, and simplicity of fixing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
3.  **Understand Control vs. Automation**: Consider how much control you desire over the code versus how much you want the AI to automate or make assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
4.  **Align with Your Technical Level**:
    *   **Non-technical users**: Lovable, Bolt, and Tempo Labs are good starting points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
    *   **Technical users (coders)**: Wind Surf and Cursor provide ultimate control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
    *   **Non-technical but product-minded (with design skills)**: Replit and Tempo Labs offer more control and are suitable for those who appreciate fine details and use tools like Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

Hunter Isacson, a developer with over 300 million downloads for his consumer apps, shares his playbook for reaching $1 million in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) with consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Isacson has developed successful apps like NGL (250 million downloads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, other apps with 60 million downloads (including a dating app and a crypto app) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, and a new app with 70 million downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. He emphasizes that while creating a business is not simple, there's currently a window for consumer AI and mobile apps to generate significant revenue without venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Hunter Isacson's Playbook for $1M MRR Consumer Apps

Hunter Isacson's approach to building a successful app business focuses on a clear, iterative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>:

1.  **Build a Simple Experience (MVP)**: Start by defining the bare-bones Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features that solve a core problem, even if rough around the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
2.  **Test Content Early**: Get users on the app quickly (hundreds to thousands) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Test content on platforms like TikTok or Instagram Reels, even during the pre-order stage, to see how people respond to the app's premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.
3.  **Define a Core Action/Northstar Metric**: Select a single core action that users need to complete, and orient all decisions around increasing the percentage of people who complete it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. This metric simplifies trade-off discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. Aim for over 90% completion of this core action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. It's crucial to have one user flow rather than branching journeys to clearly measure success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.
4.  **Continuously Seed and Apply Pressure**: Once the core action completion is proven, apply pressure by seeding the app in different audiences, niches, countries, and time zones, working with a variety of [[using_social_media_and_influencers_for_app_marketing | creators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. The goal is to get more people onto the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
5.  **Incorporate Sharing/Inviting into Core Action**: Include a sharing or inviting mechanism as part of the core user experience. This increases the app's K-factor and reduces reliance on external marketing channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.
6.  **Build a Brand People Love**: Create a brand that users resonate with and understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. Keep names short and consider using slang terms from the target community to set a comfortable, colloquial tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.
7.  **Maintain Authenticity**: Communicate publicly with an authentic voice, making the brand memeable, funny, and relatable, rather than a static entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. This increases user affinity and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples of Successful Mobile Apps

### NGL (Not Gonna Lie)
NGL, an anonymous messaging app, achieved 250 million downloads with less than $10,000 in marketing spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The app leveraged Instagram's new link feature, which became available to all users in October 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. By being an early adopter and training users on this new feature, NGL went "giga viral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Its northstar metric was the percentage of users sharing the link and a few replies, which made subsequent viewers more willing to send messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. The name NGL (Not Gonna Lie) resonated with young people and was easy to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

### Hallow
Hallow is the number one app for Christian and Catholic prayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. It successfully digitized the Bible, making it mobile, colorful, and appealing to younger audiences (millennials, Gen Z) with features like push notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Hallow charges for yearly plans and offers a friends and family plan, which makes sense for health and spirituality apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Its strength lies in a strong single-player experience with daily content (prayers, meditations) and a multiplayer component through community challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Locket
Locket was the first app to leverage iPhone widget functionality to create a social experience, allowing users to send pictures directly to a friend's home screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. It gained popularity among relationship and best-friend communities on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Locket is an example of an app that identified a new OS feature and capitalized on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### Bags.fm
Bags is a consumer crypto app designed to onboard new users while appealing to crypto natives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. It built early growth through social loops, such as logging in with Twitter, claiming a unique "bags link," and sharing it, with a leaderboard incentivizing invites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. The name "Bags" is crypto slang, making it highly resonant with the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. Its northstar metric is the percentage of users funding their accounts and making a trade on the first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.

### Cali AI
Cali AI is praised for its packaging of publicly available AI tools, creating a strong onboarding experience and user investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. It highlights the importance of presentation and funnel design, making a simple calorie-tracking app seem highly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Its success was partly driven by [[using_social_media_and_influencers_for_app_marketing | creators]] making content around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Pangu
Pangu is a modern take on virtual pets, injecting a significant degree of AI into the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. It showcases how existing ideas can be reinvented by applying new technologies like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.

## Strategies for Building a Brand and User Experience

### Brand Building
*   **Keep it Short and Recognizable**: Simple names like NGL, Wink, and Bags are easy for people to remember and resonate with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
*   **Utilize Community Slang**: Naming an app after slang terms relevant to its community (e.g., "Bags" for crypto, "NGL" for anonymous messaging) helps set a young, comfortable, and colloquial tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. This also makes users feel understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.
*   **Authentic Voice**: Maintaining an authentic and relatable public voice through social media (e.g., memes, humor) increases affinity and trust with the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

### User Experience (UX) Design
*   **Simplicity**: Focus on a "stupid simple" app with a streamlined user journey where everyone goes through the same core flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.
*   **User Investment**: Design an onboarding experience that fosters user investment, as seen in Cali AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Daily Use Cases**: For apps like Hallow, integrating daily content and single-player experiences (e.g., daily prayers, sleep meditations) encourages frequent engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Designing User Interfaces**: Hunter Isacson personally designs all his apps, including branding, using Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

## Growth and Marketing Strategies

*   **[[growth_strategies_for_consumer_mobile_apps | Product-Led Growth]]**: Focus on building a product that inherently encourages organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **[[using_social_media_and_influencers_for_app_marketing | Influencer/Creator Seeding]]**: Use platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels to seed the app with content from [[using_social_media_and_influencers_for_app_marketing | creators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This seeding aims to activate a growth loop where users share the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Minimal Paid Marketing**: Keep paid marketing spend low, focusing on testing what works on a small scale to find viral potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Growth Loops**: Implement in-app loops that encourage sharing and inviting, reducing reliance on external marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **"Old Ideas, New Channels"**: Revisit previously popular ideas (e.g., anonymous messaging, virtual pets) and apply them to new platforms or technologies (e.g., Instagram links, widgets, AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. This approach leverages existing concepts for new distribution channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

## Future Trends and Opportunities in App Development

*   **Consumer AI and Mobile Apps**: There is a significant opportunity for building startups in consumer AI and mobile apps without needing venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **AI-First Experiences**: Consider creating AI-first versions of existing app concepts (e.g., an AI-first Hallow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. GPT vision could enable novel content creation experiences, such as overlaying religious quotes on scenery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. [[designing_user_experience_for_ai_apps | Designing user experience for AI apps]] is crucial.
*   **New Apple Ecosystem Features**: Look for "wild west" opportunities when Apple introduces new real estate or functionalities in iOS updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Live Activities and lock screen widgets are highlighted as currently underexplored areas with potential for "bangers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Crypto Mainstream Adoption**: The increasing acceptance and regulation of crypto present exciting opportunities for consumer crypto apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
*   **Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses**: The future of hardware, particularly AR glasses, could enable highly immersive and shareable AI experiences, with phones potentially serving as the driving compute for these devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>. This may lead to a "singularity" where users can create and share anything in full immersive detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.
*   **Local AI Models on Phones**: Hunter envisions a future where phones become advanced enough to handle large language models (LLMs) locally, serving as the compute for lightweight AR glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
*   **Focus on Consumer Side**: For young people looking to enter tech, building consumer mobile apps is recommended to understand human psychology, product love, and virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. The tools are continually improving, suggesting a future where one might not need a technical co-founder for [[building_apps_without_coding | app development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.

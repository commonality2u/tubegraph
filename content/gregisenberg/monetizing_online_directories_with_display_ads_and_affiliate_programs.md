Frey, an "online directory King," shares insights on [[creating_directories_and_monetization_strategies | building online directories]] capable of generating $2,000 to $10,000 per month in passive income with minimal weekly maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article focuses on two primary methods of [[monetizing_online_directories | monetizing online directories]]: display advertisements and [[affiliate_marketing_strategies_and_opportunities | affiliate marketing strategies]].

## Overview of Online Directory Monetization

Online directories, often overlooked by tech founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>, can be a highly effective source of passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Frey's first directory, built in October 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, has been monetized for 18 consecutive months, requiring only about 15 minutes of maintenance per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This directory generated approximately $2,300 in revenue last month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, demonstrating the potential to reach $2,000 to $10,000 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Monetization via Display Ads

Display ads are a common and effective method for [[monetizing_online_directories | monetizing online directories]], offering a passive income stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. AdSense is a primary platform used for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Examples of Ad-Monetized Directories
*   **RoadsideAmerica.com**: This directory, focused on quirky roadside attractions in the United States, receives 85,000 monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. It is heavily monetized through display ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> and is estimated to make $5,000 to $7,000 per month passively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **AtlasObscura.com**: A worldwide directory of off-the-beaten-path attractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, this site boasts 7 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. It's monetized primarily through display ads (AdSense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> and is conservatively estimated to make around $30,000 a month from AdSense alone, possibly closer to $50,000 or $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **FindAGrave.com**: This directory allows users to find burial sites, including those of historical figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. It receives 1.4 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a> and uses AdSense as its main form of monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. It's estimated to generate $60,000 to $70,000 a month, with potential to reach $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Benefits of Display Ad Monetization
*   **Passive Income**: Display ads offer one of the most passive income experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Suitability for Pillar Pages**: The "static pillar page directory" format, which involves a single, long page containing comprehensive content for various locations/listings, is ideal for display ad monetization. These long pages can accommodate numerous ad placements, similar to how longer YouTube videos generate more ad revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

## Monetization via Affiliate Programs

In addition to display ads, [[affiliate_marketing_strategies_and_opportunities | affiliate marketing strategies]] can be highly effective, especially for niches where complementary products or services exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.

### BarkBox Example
If a dog park directory were to be published, there is alignment with the searcher's intent where people might be interested in the health of their dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. BarkBox, a company known for selling DNA kits for dogs and cats, offers an [[affiliate_marketing_strategies_and_opportunities | affiliate program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>. While their revenue might have been modest ($3-4 million), their acquisition for $90 million was largely due to the valuable data they acquired about pets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

### Combining Strategies
A directory could utilize:
*   Revenue from display ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.
*   An [[affiliate_marketing_strategies_and_opportunities | affiliate play]] with relevant products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.
*   A lead magnet or newsletter to collect more data on the target audience (e.g., dog owners), which can be highly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

## Monetization Beyond Ads and Affiliates

While display ads and affiliates offer significant passive income, directories can also serve as a foundation for larger ventures:
*   **Selling Books**: AtlasObscura.com, in addition to ads, also sells a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Building Software/SaaS**: Directories can be used to generate traffic in a specific niche, on top of which software (SaaS) can be built. This allows for higher "SaaS-like multiples" on the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. An example given is a directory for farms and CSAs that funnels relevant website traffic into a SaaS product they own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Lead Generation**: Programmatic directories can be used to sell leads to service-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.

The consistent traffic from a directory provides a strong base for these more ambitious monetization strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. A simple directory can provide enough "mailbox money" to cover bills and rent, enabling founders to pursue other projects or even leave full-time jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.

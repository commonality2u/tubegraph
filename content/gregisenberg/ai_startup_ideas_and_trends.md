Steph Smith, described as the "queen of trends" and "queen of ideas," presents two main categories of startup ideas: those that leverage [[AI startup ideas and opportunities | artificial intelligence]] and those that are "tech agnostic" but become more crucial in a rapidly changing world [02:10:21]. The goal is to provide a framework for thinking about this "barbelled world" and offer new [[AI startup ideas | startup ideas]] in both categories [02:47:06].

## Leveraging AI for Personalized Digital Experiences

### Open Page Creator
The concept of "open pages" involves individuals openly sharing personal statistics, similar to how startups display revenue and user growth [03:05:14]. Historically, building such pages was difficult and limited to financial metrics [03:24:25]. Steph Smith, for example, created an open page for her life, tracking things like books read and exercise consistency [03:31:07].

With modern tools like Cursor and Bolt, almost anyone can now create a page [03:41:26]. There's an [[AI startup ideas | AI startup opportunity]] to create a platform that allows users to easily build open pages for "just about anything," such as:
*   Supplements taken [03:55:04]
*   Exercise habits [03:58:05]
*   Glucose monitor readings [04:00:03]
*   Sobriety tracking (e.g., days sober) [07:09:47]

This idea is driven by:
*   **Technological Accessibility**: Tools like Cursor enable non-coders to create dynamic and complex pages in days or weeks [04:22:15, 07:04:19]. Steph Smith's husband, who never coded, built a detailed surfing stats page using Cursor, featuring dynamic animations and trackers [05:18:29, 05:55:04].
*   **Social Motivation**: People desire social validation and leaderboards, as seen with apps like Strava, where users openly share their running stats [04:27:00]. An open page allows individuals to reflect their personality by combining "art and data" about their life [06:27:14].
*   **Monetization Potential**: A service offering a simple free page with options for upcharging based on added modules and customization (e.g., specific embeds for fitness influencers, improved Strava embeds) [08:45:10]. This can also serve as a "link page" replacement, offering more creative real estate for monetization through affiliate links or ads [09:46:25].

Greg Eisenberg suggests that every personal webpage should include a "knowledge open page" that is gated to capture email addresses, helping creators own their audience data amidst changing social media algorithms [11:55:07]. This moves beyond static informational websites to those that actively engage and convert visitors [13:00:09].

### Centralized Personal Health Platform
There is a need for a centralized platform that integrates all personal health information [14:40:02]. Current health tracking is fragmented across various devices and services:
*   Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM) [14:45:34]
*   Oura Ring data [14:49:15]
*   Strava data [14:54:02]
*   Function Health blood test results [15:01:00]
*   Medication information [15:06:17]

An [[AI startup ideas | AI startup idea]] would be a platform that aggregates this data using existing APIs (e.g., CGM APIs, Strava API) [16:29:10]. This platform could then leverage an [[AI apps and AI startups | AI layer]], similar to a "digital doctor," to:
*   Triangulate information and suggest potential causes for health issues (e.g., linking medication to nausea experienced during a marathon) [15:46:08].
*   Allow users to "interrogate" the AI about their health data (e.g., "what's going on with my heart rate and nausea during a marathon?") [16:50:07].
*   Integrate real-time web information, potentially making it more effective than a traditional doctor in certain analyses [17:02:16].

[!INFO] Value Proposition
People are already paying for health-tracking devices and services (e.g., Eight Sleep, Oura Ring, Strava) but often lack actionable insights from the data [17:50:00]. Such a platform could be a premium subscription service (e.g., $30/month) [18:12:15]. Companies might also offer it as an employee perk, incentivizing healthier lifestyles similar to U.K. health insurance models that reward healthy behaviors [18:28:13, 18:40:00].

[!EXAMPLE] Micro Health Assistant
The platform could also act as an ongoing health assistant, helping users build habits for common issues like drinking enough water or maintaining good posture, by providing personalized reminders and insights [19:41:00].

### Custom GPTs for Directories
In the past, the digitization of information led to a boom in directory companies (e.g., Nomad List, which aggregates data for digital nomads) [22:18:04]. A new [[AI startup ideas | AI startup idea]] is to transform these directories into custom GPTs [22:40:00].
*   Instead of a static list, a custom GPT could offer personalized recommendations based on specific user criteria (e.g., "I care about good weather and need a place under $1,000/month, do I need a visa?") [22:54:04].
*   Monetization for custom GPTs is still emerging but could involve lead generation, as seen with a lawyer who uses legal GPTs to attract clients [23:35:05]. For a custom GPT to be a viable business, it needs specialized data not easily replicated by general AI models like ChatGPT or Claude [24:25:21].

### AI-Powered Dating Apps
Current dating apps are largely "looks-based" and rely on swiping through photos, even though they include other personal information [25:15:06]. The challenge is that human compatibility is often based on factors like humor and intelligence, which existing apps don't effectively capture [25:37:04].

An [[AI startup ideas | AI startup idea]] involves building dating apps that:
*   **Move beyond swiping on faces**: One concept involved swiping on memes to gauge a user's sense of humor and then matching based on that [26:00:00].
*   **AI-driven compatibility**: Leverage [[AI apps and AI startups | AI]] to determine compatibility based on various traits and interests [26:27:14].
*   **Eliminate manual swiping**: The app could automatically suggest blind dates based on integrated data from various personal applications (e.g., Goodreads, Netflix, Strava, or even a user's "open page") [26:47:04, 27:30:17].
*   **Streamline dating mechanics**: The AI could even pick the time and location for a first meeting, removing common friction points in dating [28:11:00]. This essentially creates a "personalized AI matchmaker" or "arranged marriage by AI" [27:56:06, 28:04:01].

## General Trends and Insights for Startups
*   **Differentiation is Key**: In today's market, whipping up a quick page on a generic marketing tool is "not good enough" because it makes you look like everyone else [14:16:04]. Differentiating through unique visual representations and creative vision is crucial [14:00:09, 14:22:18].
*   **Personal Websites**: Having a personal website is highly recommended as a way to connect with people and visually represent oneself [07:45:00, 08:29:05].
*   **Lead Magnets**: The traditional "subscribe to my newsletter" approach is suffering from "newsletter fatigue" [13:23:07]. People are more willing to provide their email address if they receive something tangible in return, such as exclusive content or guides [13:30:23]. This highlights a need for platforms that help manage lead magnets for personal webpages [13:33:14].

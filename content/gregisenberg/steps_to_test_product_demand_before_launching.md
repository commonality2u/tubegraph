Validating a startup idea without fully building the product is a crucial step for entrepreneurs. Justin Mayers, who built the nine-figure business Kettle and Fire, shares his framework for determining demand and willingness to pay before significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Identifying the Core Problem

Before launching Kettle and Fire, Mayers identified two main questions he needed to answer about bone broth:
1.  How many people in the world actually want this product? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
2.  Are there enough people, and will they spend enough, to build a meaningful business? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

His initial goal was modest: to build a business that could pay him and his brother $10,000 a month each, requiring approximately a $200,000 per year business and a couple thousand customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Step 1: Macro Market Validation

To gauge interest, Mayers first looked at the "micro" level within tight-knit communities, then broadened to the "macro" level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Community Engagement
He identified specific communities interested in bone broth, such as those involved in CrossFit and the paleo diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. He then observed where these groups congregated online, including Mark's Daily Apple, Paleo Hacks, and Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. By analyzing traffic and engagement on threads discussing bone broth's benefits for skin, gut, and joint health, he found a small but fanatic group of people interested in the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Google Trends Analysis
Next, he used Google Trends to see how "bone broth" was trending. Observing that it was starting to take off and more people were discussing it, he concluded there were at least several thousand people interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Fixing Your Own Problem vs. Market Trends
> Mayers clarifies that while he used Google Trends for validation, the initial idea for Kettle and Fire came from his own problem—he wanted bone broth and observed others in his community seeking it for health benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Google Trends merely helped him validate it as a viable business rather than just a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. If Google Trends or subsequent testing showed no demand, he would not have proceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Step 2: Micro Economic Validation (Willingness to Pay)

To confirm if people would actually pay for the product, Mayers undertook the following steps, which are key to [[finding_and_validating_software_business_ideas|finding and validating software business ideas]] or any product ideas:

1.  **Minimal Setup**: He bought the cheapest bone broth domain name he could find for $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. He paid $5 on Fiverr for a basic logo and renders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
2.  **Landing Page Creation**: Using Unbounce, he built a simple landing page that highlighted value propositions derived from paleo forums, such as healing leaky gut, convenience (due to the 24-48 hour cooking time for bone broth), and the use of organic, grass-fed ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This low-cost approach is an example of [[prototyping_app_ideas_for_business_and_marketing|prototyping app ideas for business and marketing]] with minimal resources.
3.  **Pricing Strategy**: Despite having no idea how to make the product, he set a price of $29.99 for 16 ounces, significantly higher than typical grocery store broth at $5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. His rationale was that if people paid six times more for an unproven product, the economics could work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
4.  **"Scam-like" Checkout Flow**: The "order now" button on the landing page directed customers to his personal PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
5.  **Paid Advertising**: He spent about $100 on Bing Ads (because it was cheaper than Google Adwords) to drive traffic to the landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
6.  **Results and Analysis**: Over a two-week test, despite the sketchy checkout flow and non-existent product, people converted. He saw multiple payments come through his PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The test yielded nearly $500 in revenue with about $250 in ad spend and a 30% conversion rate (people clicking "order now") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. This validated that people were willing to pay for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Based on this, he projected a potential $100,000 per year business even with a janky setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### Post-Validation Communication
After validating demand, Mayers emailed all customers who had placed an order. He was upfront that the product didn't exist yet and offered a full refund or a 50% discount for waiting. Most opted for the discount, demonstrating strong interest and patience, even though it took eight months to ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Modern Tools and Strategies (2025 Perspective)

If starting Kettle and Fire today, Mayers notes that the process of [[techniques_for_brainstorming_and_validating_startup_ideas|techniques for brainstorming and validating startup ideas]] would be even more efficient due to advancements in AI and other tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>:

*   **Improved Design**: Landing pages and logos could be designed much better and faster using AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Sentiment Analysis**: AI can quickly scrape and analyze sentiment across platforms like Reddit, forums, and Twitter to understand what people are saying about a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:13:03]</a>. This is part of [[conducting_competitive_analysis_for_saas_ideas|conducting competitive analysis for SaaS ideas]] or CPG.
*   **Core Principle Remains**: The fundamental step of trying to sell a product that doesn't exist yet, by getting 10 people to pay for it, remains incredibly validating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Accessible Tools**: Tools like Bolt.new and Rok, along with frontier models like Claude, GPT, and Gemini, make it easier than ever for individuals to build and test products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. A $20/month Chat GPT subscription allows for testing dozens of startup ideas monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   **Individual Advantage**: AI tools particularly benefit individuals with strong opinions or visions, enabling them to build products that previously required larger teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This lowers the barriers for [[creating_a_successful_cpg_business|creating a successful CPG business]] or any other product.

## Finding Startup Ideas and Opportunities

Mayers advises that the best startup ideas often come from where an individual is deeply interested and knowledgeable—the "frontier" of a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### Focus on Passion and Problems
Instead of chasing specific industries like software, entrepreneurs should focus on problems that genuinely excite them or that they find more interesting than the alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. For Mayers, this was his passion for improving human health and solving the chronic disease crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. By circling such a problem, new and interesting ideas naturally emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

### Validating Pain Points
Regardless of the industry, it's crucial to validate the market and understand specific pain points. Data from communities like Reddit can provide insight into sentiment and problem areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. This data can then be distilled, potentially with AI, to create clear value propositions and rapidly launch a landing page within a day, allowing for quick validation of demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

When considering [[comparison_of_ai_coding_tools | AI coding tools]], understanding their pricing structures and available free tiers is crucial for users to make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## General Pricing Overview
Most of the discussed AI coding tools, such as Lovable, Bolt, and Tempo, share a similar base [[pricing_models_for_ai_apps | pricing model]] for their initial tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. This starter amount typically ranges from $20 to $40 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Higher-priced tiers are also available, potentially going up to $50 or $130, with some tools offering even more expensive options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## Leveraging Free Tiers
A key strategy for evaluating these tools is to utilize their generous free tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Many tools offer daily or weekly caps on their free usage, allowing users to test functionalities without immediate financial commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

> "All of them have great free tiers. And some of them have daily caps, weekly caps. Just play around that, right? Play around that, explore, test all these different tools and then whatever tool makes sense for you you can then choose to upgrade." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>

It is highly recommended to explore and experiment with the free tiers of various [[understanding_ai_tools_and_models_for_development | AI tools]] to determine which one best suits individual needs and preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. This hands-on experience helps users make an informed decision before committing to a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

> "I would highly suggest that you use every tool's free tier and build a simple to-do list app. Just build something simple, doesn't have to be crazy, you don't have to build the next AI product. Build a simple to-do list app and invite, evaluated how was your experience?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>

By testing tools in this manner, users can assess factors like control, ease of use, and whether the AI's assumptions align with their expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

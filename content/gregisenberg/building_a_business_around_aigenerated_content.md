This article explores how to [[building_businesses_with_ai_technology | build a business]] around AI-generated content, specifically focusing on video content created with Google V3. PJ, a creator known for his viral [[using_ai_to_create_viral_content | AI films]] with hundreds of thousands of likes on X, shares his process, prompts, and monetization strategies [00:00:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He aims to provide an A-to-Z tutorial on how to make money with V3 [00:00:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Viral Pharmaceutical Commercial Case Study

PJ gained significant attention after creating a pharmaceutical commercial using 100% AI, specifically Google V3 [00:00:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. His goal with this project was not just to demonstrate cool AI capabilities but to show how to genuinely [[building_businesses_with_ai_technology | make money]] from this new technology [00:01:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

The commercial consistently went viral, and PJ explains the practical, step-by-step process of its creation and how such content can be monetized to [[building_businesses_with_ai_technology | build a business]] around generative AI [00:01:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. He emphasizes that anyone willing to put in the work can do this, regardless of technical background, as LLMs (Large Language Models) are making content creation increasingly accessible [00:01:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The key is to create entertaining content [00:02:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>).

### Ideation and Scripting
The process begins with a unique idea or hook [00:05:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>). For the pharmaceutical ad, the initial concept came from a friend requesting a standard pharmaceutical commercial [00:06:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>). PJ quickly realized that a "cinematic blasé garbage" approach would be commoditized and lacked uniqueness [00:06:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>).

The "twist" was introduced: what if a placebo pill led to a puppy being delivered [00:07:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>)? This evolved into the idea of a pill secreting pheromones that attract puppies [00:07:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>).

PJ's scripting process using ChatGBT involves:
1.  **General Instructions**: Start by giving ChatGBT very generalized instructions to generate cliché content [00:07:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>).
2.  **Iterative Refinement**: Tear apart the initial output. For the pharmaceutical ad, PJ prompted for "four scripts for a standard pharmaceutical commercial for a fake medication that solves depression by taking a pill that's a play on words that includes 'pup' in the name and sounds like a real medication" [00:07:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>). He specifically asked for an "SNL style satirical take" [00:08:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>).
3.  **Generating Twists**: If you don't have a "kernel" idea, you can ask ChatGBT for viral twists. For example, "can you give me five different twists on a pharmaceutical commercial that could be really funny if it's SNL style?" [00:09:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>).
4.  **One-Liners and Zingers**: Once the general direction is set, prompt for funny one-off lines that can become the body of the commercial [00:13:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>). PJ continually re-feeds his favorite lines to help the model learn and update [00:14:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>). He notes that about 70% of the lines in his commercial came from ChatGBT through this iterative process [00:15:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>).
5.  **Outsourcing Taste**: To refine the humor, you can prompt ChatGBT to create jokes "in the style of Seth Rogan" or "imagine you're Bill Burr doing a standup comedy routine" [00:15:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>).
6.  **Using Multiple LLMs**: Don't limit yourself to just ChatGBT. PJ recommends trying Claude and Grok (especially its unhinged mode) to get different and sometimes "insane" results [00:12:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>).

### Prompt Generation for V3
Once the script is locked, convert each dialogue line into a prompt for V3 [00:16:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>).
*   **Prompt Structure**: Provide ChatGBT with a base prompt structure and ask it to extrapolate prompts for each line, describing characters and actions [00:16:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>).
*   **Simplicity**: V3 doesn't require overly complicated prompts; a description of what's happening and the dialogue is often sufficient [00:17:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>).
*   **Cost Management**: Run V3 prompts one at a time due to cost (approx. $2-3 per shot) [00:19:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>). This allows for immediate feedback and adjustments.
*   **Audio/Subtitle Issues**: V3's audio generation can be inconsistent. PJ found that not including quotes in prompts can reduce "weird gibberish subtitles" [00:19:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>).
*   **Character Consistency**: V3 is currently text-to-video, lacking strong image-to-video capabilities, so character consistency is a challenge [00:20:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>). To maintain a similar look, describe characters in extreme detail every time [00:20:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>).

### Post-Production and Cost
The pharmaceutical commercial, which would typically cost $100K to $1M to produce traditionally, cost PJ about $500 in V3 credits [00:21:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>).

PJ uses Final Cut Pro for editing, but Cap Cut or DaVinci Resolve (free) are also good options [00:23:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>). He generates many clips to get good ones, with a ratio of about 5:1 (bad clips to good clips) [00:23:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>).

Key editing considerations:
*   **Camera Movements**: Prompting for camera movements (e.g., "camera push in" or "dolly in") makes the shots feel less AI-generated [00:22:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>).
*   **Emotional Detail**: You can prompt specific emotions, like "she coyly quips her response aware that she's making a joke about her husband's infidelity," and the AI will convey that [00:22:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>).
*   **Audio**: V3 generates audio automatically with the video, so separate voice-over tools like Eleven Labs are not needed [00:24:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>). However, V3 audio can sound "thin" and lacks voice consistency [00:24:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>).

### The "Hook" for Virality
For content to go viral, especially on platforms like X (Twitter), the "hook" is paramount [00:26:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>).

> "The title of the video is more important than the thumbnail. And the thumbnail is more important than the actual content of the video because if he can't get you to like hook you on the title, he's not going to get you to really engage with the thumbnail. And if he doesn't hook you on the thumbnail, he's not going to get you to watch the full video." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>
> — PJ, referencing Mr. Beast

For the pharmaceutical commercial, PJ's hook was: "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials. I made this for $500 in V3 credits in less than a day. What's the argument for spending 500K now? Steal my prompt below" [00:26:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>).

Analysis of a good hook:
*   **Flex**: "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials" establishes credibility [00:27:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>).
*   **Trending Topic/Value**: "I made this for $500 with V3" leverages a trending topic (V3) and highlights cost-effectiveness [00:27:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>).
*   **Symmetry**: The "500K to $500" cost comparison is visually appealing [00:27:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>).
*   **Question**: "What's the argument for spending 500K now?" generates replies and engagement [00:27:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>).
*   **Call to Action/Value Offer**: "Steal my prompt below" encourages clicks and algorithm boosts [00:27:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>).

## Monetization Strategies for AI-Generated Content
PJ outlines 10 ways to [[building_businesses_with_ai_technology | monetize content]] created with V3 and other generative AI tools [00:31:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>).

1.  **Build a Brand for Yourself**: Use AI content to establish a personal brand and get into the content creation ecosystem, leading to downstream work [00:31:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>). An audience is very valuable, enabling you to tell short stories and gain followers who trust you [00:44:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>).
2.  **Attract Direct Clients for Commercials**: Create less viral, more standard commercials for clients like pharmaceutical companies, food brands, or CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) brands [00:31:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>). Agencies are often unable to create "unhinged special effects kind of shots" within their budgets, presenting an opportunity for AI creators [00:33:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>). You can charge anywhere from $5,000 upwards [00:33:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>).
3.  **Build a Portfolio for Agencies**: Create a specialized portfolio, focusing on a niche that interests you (e.g., knife commercials, boot commercials) [00:34:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>). PJ controversially suggests to "rip these shots shot for shot" from award-winning commercials to learn pacing and flow, then tweak them uniquely [00:35:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>).
4.  **Create Narrative Series with Brand Integrations**: Develop a consistent narrative universe (e.g., Neural Viz's "moniverse" alien series) and integrate products or brands organically within the story [00:37:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>). This allows for monetizing through product placements [00:38:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>). Taking a popular social format (e.g., "man on the street" interviews, Zillow tours) and adding an AI twist (e.g., aliens) can also drive virality [00:39:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>).
5.  **Sell Courses/Digital Products**: Bundle knowledge into courses, PDFs, or other digital products related to [[developing_content_strategies_and_using_ai_for_content_creation | content strategies and using AI for content creation]] [00:39:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>).
6.  **Consulting with Larger Companies**: Offer consulting services to Fortune 500 and other companies on integrating generative AI into their operations, ensuring legal compliance and security [00:40:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>). Pricing depends on the scale of the company [00:41:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>).
7.  **Build a Sketch Comedy Channel**: Create a sketch comedy show using AI, similar to Key & Peele [00:41:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>). While direct monetization can be harder, large audiences can enable product integrations, as seen with Bang energy drinks on TikTok [00:41:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>).
8.  **Narrative Films (with caution)**: While possible to create long-form content like TV shows, PJ is less bullish on this for generative AI [00:41:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>). The technology iterates too fast, leading to potential inconsistencies in quality between early and late parts of a long film [00:42:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>).
9.  **Pitch Brands on Narrative Content**: Instead of general commercials, pitch brands on creating specific, multi-episode narrative series where their product is integrated as a central element [00:43:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>).
10. **Pick a Small Sub-Niche**: Target underserved niches with high demand, such as Bible content (open-sourced IP with billions of users) [00:43:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>). Another example is "BookTok" or "Romantasy" (romantic fantasy) communities, creating book promos or scenes from books for authors [00:45:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>). These niches often have significant monetization potential [00:44:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>).

## Key Takeaways

*   **Embrace Your Niche**: Lean into your unique interests and "weirdness" [00:34:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>).
*   **Copy Frameworks**: Replicate the frameworks of successful content and apply them to your niche [00:44:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>).
*   **Focus on Engagement**: With the deluge of content, understanding *why* people engage, watch, and share content is more important than technical proficiency [00:05:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>).
*   **Leverage AI for Underserved Niches**: AI [[automating_content_creation_with_ai | automates content creation]] to a degree that allows for high-quality [[creating_highimpact_niche_content_using_ai | niche content]] in areas that previously couldn't afford high-end cinematography [00:45:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>).
*   **Weekly Episodic Content**: Prioritize creating weekly episodic content over trying to replicate the old Hollywood model of long-form feature films, as this aligns with modern consumption habits [00:42:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>).

The overall process is:
1.  Start with ChatGBT to create your script [00:30:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>).
2.  Use ChatGBT again to generate V3 prompts [00:30:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>).
3.  Process V3 output in a video editor like Final Cut Pro or Cap Cut [00:30:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>).
4.  Create a strong "hook" for social media platforms like X, then expand to other platforms like YouTube [00:30:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>).
5.  This process opens the door to numerous [[business_ideas_using_aigenerated_content | business ideas using AI-generated content]], particularly in underserved vertical niches [00:45:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>).

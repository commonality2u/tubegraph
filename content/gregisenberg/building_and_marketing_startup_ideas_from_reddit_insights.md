This article outlines a detailed process for [[brainstorming_startup_ideas | brainstorming startup ideas]] and validating them using insights from Reddit, augmented by AI tools for both business and content creation. The methodology has been used to build multi-million dollar businesses by identifying [[techniques_for_discovering_validated_startup_ideas | validated startup ideas]] that resonate with target audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Four-Step Process for Discovering Validated Startup Ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

The core of this approach involves a four-step process for finding validated ideas and then applying similar principles to content creation.

### Step 1: Find Trending Subreddits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>

The initial step involves identifying rapidly growing communities on Reddit using a tool called Gummy Search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

*   **Utilize Gummy Search** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
    *   Navigate to the "trending" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   Focus on subreddits sorted by their growth rate (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Target Mid-Sized Communities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
    *   Instead of massive subreddits, concentrate on those with 10,000 to 100,000 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. These "newer communities" are trending and indicate a current societal interest, answering the "why now" question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Identify Personal Advantage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>
    *   While scrolling through trending subreddits, consider if you have an "unfair advantage" or connection to a particular topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Note-Taking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
    *   Keep notes in a notebook or Google Doc on interesting subreddits and potential areas of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Experiment with Timeframes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
    *   Adjust the time frame to daily, weekly, or monthly growth to uncover different insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Leverage Curated Sections** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>
    *   Gummy Search also offers curated sections (e.g., for software engineers) which can be added to an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Step 2: Find Problems and Solutions within Selected Subreddits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>

Once a subreddit is chosen, the next step is to delve into the community's discussions to uncover unmet needs and existing solutions. This contributes significantly to [[using_ai_tools_to_find_startup_ideas_on_reddit | using AI tools to find startup ideas on Reddit]].

*   **Create Audiences in Gummy Search** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
    *   Add the chosen subreddit and similar communities to a custom "audience" (e.g., "people into dog food") within Gummy Search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Analyze Pain and Anger** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>
    *   Use Gummy Search's "Pain and Anger" section to find common patterns and summarized frustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This AI-powered summarization helps identify core issues like "potty training challenges" or "eating habits loss of appetite" in the dog food example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Review Advice and Requests** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>
    *   This section reveals what products or solutions people are actively seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Examples include "dog breeding recommendations" or "dog food recommendations" for specific needs like senior dogs with dental issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Examine Solution Requests** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>
    *   The "Solution Requests" category provides insights into the competitive landscape, showing what products or methods people are currently using to address their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Develop Startup Ideas** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>
    *   As you read through these sections, actively generate ideas and write them down, even if similar businesses exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Focus on potential gaps in marketing, social media presence, or opportunities to partner with creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Create a One-Pager** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
    *   Consolidate all findings into a "one-pager" document outlining the business idea, identified problems, and competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

### Step 3: Identify Creators in the Niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>

Understanding the content creators within a niche provides further validation and audience insights. This step leverages [[aidriven_startup_ideas_and_entrepreneurship | AI-driven startup ideas and entrepreneurship]].

*   **Find Influencers with Perplexity.ai** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>
    *   Use AI tools like Perplexity.ai to find popular educational YouTubers or influencers in the chosen niche (e.g., "25 most popular dog educational YouTubers") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
    *   Compile this list into a Google Sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   **Analyze YouTube Comments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>
    *   Visit the creators' YouTube channels, sort videos by "most popular," and read the comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
    *   Comments reveal audience desires, thoughts, and further validate problems or solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
    *   Add these learnings to the one-pager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Step 4: Wireframe and Name the Idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>

With insights gathered, the next phase is to conceptualize the product or service.

*   **Wireframe the Website** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>
    *   Based on the collected insights, wireframe a website that addresses the identified problems and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. An example given is a design agency focused on conversion and cash flow, framed from an insight that people were upset with designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
    *   Tools like Framer can be used to quickly build and deploy a basic website (MVP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   **Develop a Catchy, Validated Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>
    *   Sometimes, a company name can be derived directly from a subreddit's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
    *   A good name should be catchy and resonate with the target audience, often inspired by insights from the community (e.g., "Design Science" from the desire for designers to be more "scientific" and less "artistic") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

## Creating Content People Will Love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>

The same principles used for discovering startup ideas can be applied to [[creative_lowcost_marketing_ideas | creative low-cost marketing ideas]] and content strategy.

*   **Analyze Top Content in Gummy Search** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>
    *   Go to the "Top Content" section in Gummy Search for the chosen audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
    *   Observe the best-performing content, common patterns, and preferred formats (e.g., long stories, memes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.
    *   This helps in understanding what resonates with the community (e.g., stories about saving a dog's life) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.
*   **Query Gummy Search for Content Insights** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>
    *   Utilize Gummy Search as an "entrepreneurial assistant" or "co-founder" by asking specific questions about content preferences (e.g., "Do they love memes?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. This connects dots and helps in understanding community nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

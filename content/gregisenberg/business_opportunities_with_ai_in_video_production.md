The rise of generative AI, particularly tools like Google's V3, has opened up significant [[business_opportunities_with_ai | business opportunities]] in video production, especially for creating viral content and advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This technology makes it possible for individuals to produce cinematic content without needing high technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## The AI Video Creation Workflow

The process of creating AI-generated videos, such as commercials, typically involves several steps:

1.  **Ideation and Scripting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>:
    *   Start with a unique idea or "hook" that is unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   Use a large language model (LLM) like [[using_ai_for_writing_and_content_creation | ChatGPT]] to generate initial scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Start with general instructions and let the AI produce clich√© content, then refine it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
    *   Request multiple script versions and extract the best lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   For satirical content, explicitly tell the AI to adopt styles of known comedians or shows (e.g., SNL, Seth Rogen, Bill Burr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
    *   Experiment with different LLMs like Claude or Grok (especially its "unhinged" or "fun" mode) for diverse outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
    *   Continuously refeed favorite lines and direct the AI to generate more "zingers" or "one-liners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Approximately 70% of lines in a viral ad could be AI-generated through this iterative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

2.  **Prompting for Video Generation (V3)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>:
    *   Convert each dialogue line into a detailed prompt for V3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
    *   Describe the characters (e.g., age, appearance, attire) and their emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
    *   Include details about poses, shot types, camera types, and background elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
    *   Prompt specific camera movements like "push in" or "dolly in" to make shots feel more natural and less AI-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
    *   Run prompts one at a time due to cost (approx. $2-3 per shot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
    *   V3 generates both video and audio directly from text prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. Avoid using quotes in prompts to reduce gibberish subtitles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

3.  **Editing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>:
    *   Use video editing software like Final Cut Pro, Cap Cut, or DaVinci Resolve (free option) to stitch clips together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.
    *   Expect a generation ratio of about 5:1 (meaning 5 clips generated for 1 good one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.

### Current Limitations of AI Video
*   **Cost**: Generating clips can be expensive, with the viral pharmaceutical ad costing about $500 in V3 credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.
*   **Audio Consistency**: Audio generation can be inconsistent, with characters sometimes not talking or sounding "thin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Voice consistency across different clips is also lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
*   **Character Consistency**: Current text-to-video models like V3 lack strong character consistency, meaning the same character rarely looks identical across different shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. Detailed descriptions can help but aren't foolproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
*   **Image-to-Video**: The image-to-video functionality is not yet highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.
*   **Long-Form Content**: The rapid iteration of AI models makes long-form content (e.g., 90-minute films) challenging, as early parts of a film might look dated by the time later parts are generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>. Short, episodic content is generally more viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.

## Strategies for Viral Content with AI

To ensure AI-generated videos gain traction:
*   **Focus on Entertainment**: The ultimate goal is to create entertaining content that people want to watch and share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Craft a Strong Hook/Headline**: The headline is crucial, especially on platforms like X (Twitter), needing to capture attention in less than two seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.
    *   Use provocative statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.
    *   Incorporate "trendjacking" by referencing new AI models (e.g., V3, Kling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
    *   Highlight cost or time savings dramatically (e.g., "$500,000 commercial for $500") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
    *   Ask questions to encourage replies, which boosts algorithmic reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
    *   Offer value (e.g., "Steal my prompt below") to encourage clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.
*   **Leverage Existing Formats**: Identify popular social media formats (e.g., "Man on the street" interviews, Zillow tours, Joe Rogan-style podcasts) and apply a unique, unexpected twist using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_monetizing_content_with_ai | Monetization Strategies]] for AI Video

[[leveraging_ai_for_business_ideas_and_revenue | Leveraging AI for business ideas and revenue]] in video production offers multiple avenues:

1.  **Build a Personal Brand**: [[using_ai_in_content_creation | Using AI in content creation]] can help build a personal brand and audience, which can lead to downstream work and significant monetary value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

2.  **Attract Direct Clients for Commercials**: Create AI-generated commercials (e.g., for food products, underwear brands) and pitch them directly to companies, agencies, or media buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. AI allows for "unhinged special effects" shots at budgets agencies couldn't match, enabling charges of $5,000 and up per project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.

3.  **Build a Portfolio for Agencies**: Develop a specialized portfolio focusing on a [[niche_ai_opportunities | niche]] (e.g., knife commercials) that aligns with your interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. To level up quickly, "steal" (replicate, then adapt) award-winning commercial shots using AI to understand pacing and flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

4.  **Create Narrative Series with Brand Integrations**: Develop an original AI-generated narrative universe (e.g., Neural Viz's "Moniverse") and integrate products or brands as artifacts within the story, monetizing through product placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.

5.  **Sell Courses or Digital Products**: Package knowledge and techniques for AI video creation into courses, PDFs, or other digital products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

6.  **Offer Consulting Services**: Provide expertise to larger companies (e.g., Fortune 500) on integrating generative AI into their content strategies, including legal compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Consulting fees can be scaled based on the size of the client company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

7.  **Build a Sketch Comedy Channel**: Create AI-generated sketch comedy shows. While harder to monetize directly, a large audience can attract brand deals (e.g., through product placement like Bang energy drinks on TikTok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.

8.  **Produce Short Episodic Content**: Focus on weekly episodic content rather than long-form narrative films, as it aligns better with current consumption habits and the rapid advancements in AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>.

9.  **Pitch Narrative Content to Brands**: Offer to create custom narrative series featuring a brand's products or story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

10. **Target Underserved Niches**: Identify small sub-niches with high demand and low content supply, such as Bible content or "BookTok" (romantasy books), and create AI-generated marketing materials or scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. This represents significant [[business_opportunities_using_ai_in_niche_markets | business opportunities using AI in niche markets]] where clients might not be able to afford traditional production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.

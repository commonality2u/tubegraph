## The Riz App Phenomenon
An [[aidriven_dating_app_innovations|AI dating coach]] application, built on top of [[aidriven_innovations_like_chatgpt_40_and_their_applications|ChatGPT]], demonstrated significant success by making \$190,000 per month and achieving 333,000 downloads per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. The founder reportedly got the idea from a Tinder subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

This app, named Plug AI, is a "[[aidriven_innovations_like_chatgpt_40_and_their_applications|ChatGPT]] wrapper" focused on companionship and dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Its success is attributed more to marketing and branding than unique product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. The app facilitates generating pickup lines by allowing users to screenshot their text messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. The term "Riz" (or "Rizz") is used by youth to describe a person's charm or ability to flirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

The founder of Plug AI, a 23-year-old, co-founded a three-person development studio called AI Riz, which has launched three apps and is closing in on \$500,000 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Expanding AI Coaching into Multiple Verticals
The company behind Plug AI, called AI Riz, has developed other AI-powered coaching applications beyond dating:
*   **Astra**: Offers life advice, helping users with challenges, compatibility, personal growth, and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.
*   **Pallet**: Determines a user's color season from a selfie using AI, and generates custom color palettes, personalized style, and makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

This strategy involves leveraging existing AI technology to create focused "AI coaching" products in different niche verticals, rather than building extensive proprietary technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Sustainability
Despite the financial success, there are concerns about the sustainability of these apps due to their reliance on third-party AI models like [[aidriven_innovations_like_chatgpt_40_and_their_applications|ChatGPT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>. For example, if OpenAI were to significantly increase its charges, it could impact the business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>.

However, advocates argue that the skills gained from running such a profitable business are transferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>. Even if the business is a "flash in the pan," making millions in profit within a year provides significant financial stability, or "your first nut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>. The practical goal of achieving financial independence often precedes the ambition to "change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>.

## The "Anti-Trend" Opportunity
The rise of AI-driven services creates an "anti-trend" opportunity for human-centric alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. While AI offers scalable solutions, there will likely be an increasing demand for human-based coaching and services, potentially at a premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a>.

This could involve offering premium upgrades to AI apps, where human intervention is available, or creating entirely separate businesses that provide human coaching in the same verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. Such "anti-trend" ventures typically face less competition than the rapidly saturating AI assistant market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Differentiating App Names
> There can be confusion between the company "AI Riz" and its app "Plug AI" (which is the one making \$190k/month), and a competitor called "Riz AI," which is currently the number 27 app in lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>. This highlights the competitive nature of this market.

For those looking to build new AI-powered applications, focusing on "non-obvious use cases" rather than oversaturated categories like dating or therapy is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.

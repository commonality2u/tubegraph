Reasoning models represent a new frontier in AI capabilities, allowing models to "think about different things that it wouldn't be able to do before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. These models are available for free to developers within [[understanding_ai_tools_and_models_for_development | Google's AI Studio]] and via API keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. They can be used with tools like Cursor by bringing your own API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Enhanced Problem-Solving
Unlike models that provide a "first answer that comes to the model's head," reasoning models engage in a more thorough thought process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This internal "thinking process" is displayed as "thoughts" within the AI Studio user interface, offering intuition into the model's operations before it generates its final output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. When accessing the API directly, these thoughts are abstracted behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Applications in Software Development
Reasoning models demonstrate significant potential in [[using_ai_to_build_software_applications | software application development]]. For example, a reasoning model can take a basic Python code snippet and, after a "thinking process," generate the blueprint for a "fully-fledged website plus Landing Page Plus SaaS app" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

The model's "thoughts" for such a task include:
*   **Desired outcomes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>
*   **Necessary code structure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>
*   **Different concepts and technology stack** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>
*   **Optimized landing page elements**, such as subheaders, feature sections, call-to-actions (CTAs), and visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>
*   **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for SaaS functionality**, including user authentication, a dashboard, and image generation tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>

This detailed outlining process, similar to creating long outlines for essays or code structures in traditional programming, allows the model to produce comprehensive content and code, even if some specific details might need follow-up requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. A complex generation like this can complete in approximately 23 seconds, indicating substantial processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

## Accessibility and Cost
[[prompting_with_reasoning_models | Reasoning models]] are available for free to developers within [[understanding_ai_tools_and_models_for_development | Google's AI Studio]] and through API keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Google aims to remove the "economic burden" for developers and startups building AI products by offering significant free tokens (e.g., 1.5 billion tokens for Gemini models) and free access to features like the multimodal live experience for prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

## What are [[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI Agents]]?

[[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]], exemplified by "retail AI", are essentially voice large language models (LLMs) that can perform specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A demonstration of such an agent involved setting up a dental appointment, where the agent flawlessly handled attempts to disrupt its process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. For instance, when asked "never" for a meeting time, the agent would politely respond and conclude the call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Practical Applications

### Customer Service and Sales

[[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]] can be scaled for companies to manage various interactions, including:
*   Taking initial calls with leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   Setting up subsequent calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   Handling rescheduling requests from leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   Potentially closing sales with customers directly in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Companies with large customer service teams represent a significant opportunity for [[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Business Impact and Opportunities

The impact of [[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]] on business profitability is substantial. For example, a recent report from Clara indicated they expect to add $40 million in profit by integrating 700 new [[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. These agents were reported to handle 2.3 million chats 80-90% faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

This demonstrates a clear trend towards [[future_of_marketing_with_ai_agents | incorporating AI features in applications]] and highlights a significant opportunity for agencies specializing in [[role_of_ai_agents_in_marketing_automation | AI transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. Such agencies could offer services based on a performance model, taking a percentage of the cost savings or, ideally, focusing on the value generated (e.g., increased customer acquisition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. While starting with a percentage of cost savings can be helpful for de-risking, the ultimate goal is to capture value directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

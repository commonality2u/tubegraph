Knowing how to use them in tandem is key to achieving desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Adding Motion and Enhancements

Beyond static images, AI tools can add motion and refine details, leading to dynamic content.

### Runway: Image to Video Transformation
Runway is a high-quality tool for adding motion to images, transforming them into videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Users upload an image and provide a prompt (often generated by ChatGPT) to dictate the movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This can create beautiful videos in minutes, for example, adding soft ripples to water or gentle swaying to trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Runway can also upscale videos to 4K quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

### Cling: Looping Videos and AI Sound
Cling is another image-to-video tool that uniquely allows for start and end frames, enabling seamless video loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. This is useful for creating perpetually looping icons or background elements for websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Additionally, Cling can generate AI sound options that are contextually relevant to the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

### Stitching Videos for Continuous Shots

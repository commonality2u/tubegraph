These agencies focus on leveraging artificial intelligence to drive significant business outcomes for clients.

## Key Service Areas

### [[AI Agents and Automation | AI Agents]] for Customer Service & Sales
A major area of opportunity for [[AI transformation agencies | AI transformation agencies]] is the deployment of [[AI agents and their applications | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These agents can handle a variety of tasks at scale, including:
*   Taking initial calls with leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   Setting up subsequent calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   Managing rescheduling requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   Potentially closing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

For instance, a demo of Retail AI showed [[AI agents and their applications | AI agents]] flawlessly setting up dental appointments, even when attempts were made to "throw it off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

Clara's recent report highlighted the immense impact of [[AI agents and automation | AI agents]], projecting an additional $40 million in profit due to the integration of 700 new [[AI agents and their applications | AI agents]], which handle 2.3 million chats 80-90% faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This demonstrates a "huge opportunity to just go to companies with big customer service teams" and offer [[AI-driven automation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### AI-Assisted Content & Programmatic SEO
Beyond customer service, [[AI transformation agencies | AI transformation agencies]] can specialize in areas like:
*   **[[Building apps using AI tools | AI-assisted content]]**: As seen with "boring marketer," [[AI]] can enhance content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.
*   **Programmatic SEO**: Leveraging [[AI]] for automated search engine optimization strategies is a viable approach, especially within a current "one to two-year window" of opportunity before search dynamics potentially change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

### Creative Agencies as an X-Factor
In the evolving landscape, "creative becoming more and more of an X Factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. [[AI transformation agencies | AI transformation agencies]] might incorporate or collaborate with creative agencies to deliver holistic solutions.

## Business Model: The Pay-for-Performance Approach
A highly compelling business model for [[AI transformation agencies | AI transformation agencies]] is "pay for performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Leveraging Data for Risk Assessment
In an [[AI agents and their applications | AI]] and data-rich world, marketers possess more data, enabling them to "underwrite" opportunities and "be willing to bet on this particular opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This allows for performance-based charging, where payment is contingent on achieving specific results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

> "As a marketer if you're a good marketer you would charge on performance right but most people aren't willing to take the risk." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>

### Charging for Value (vs. Cost Savings)
While initially offering a percentage of cost savings can be helpful to "derisk the entrepreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, a more impactful approach is to charge for the value created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

> "Instead of saying hey I'm going to save you money it's like no I'm going to get you like X more customers or something like that â€” and just charge them like up front." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>

An example of this is a pay-for-performance Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) agency called Spiralytics. If an e-commerce conversion rate doubles from 1% to 2%, and that's worth $25 million, the agency might take a 10% spread, earning $2.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

The implementation of smart contracts could further enhance transparency and fairness in these performance-based agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Funds could be held in escrow and released automatically upon meeting agreed-upon metrics, reducing anxiety for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## Future Outlook for AI Transformation Agencies

### Low Capital Expenditure
A significant advantage of establishing [[AI transformation agencies | AI transformation agencies]] is the relatively low capital expenditure required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Key requirements include a brand, a landing page, and a defined vertical focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Incubating Software Products
Agencies can also serve as incubators for software products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. With [[AI co-pilots]], developers are becoming "four to eight times more effective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, enabling the rapid development of innovative tools and services.

Overall, there is a strong "bullish" sentiment towards agencies, particularly those capable of leveraging [[AI]] to deliver tangible, performance-based results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.

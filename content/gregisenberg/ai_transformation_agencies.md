The current landscape of business presents a significant opportunity for [[ai_startup_opportunities | AI transformation agencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. Just as digital transformation has been a focus, the shift is now towards integrating artificial intelligence into business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

## Core Services and Opportunities

These agencies focus on helping businesses leverage AI for increased efficiency and innovation.

### Implementing AI Agents

A key area of opportunity lies in deploying [[ai_agents_for_business_automation | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. These are voice or text-based AI models capable of handling complex interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Examples of [[ai_agents_for_business_automation | AI agent]] capabilities include:
*   **Customer Service**: [[ai_agents_for_business_automation | AI agents]] can take calls with leads, set up subsequent calls, and manage rescheduling requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. An example shared involves Retail AI, which demonstrated seamless dental appointment scheduling, even when attempts were made to "throw it off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Profit Generation**: Clara, a company, reported that by adding around 700 new [[ai_agents_for_business_automation | AI agents]], they expect to add $40 million in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. These agents handled 2.3 million chats and operated 80-90% faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Cost Savings**: There is a significant opportunity to approach companies with large customer service teams and offer to save them substantial amounts, such as $2 million per month, by utilizing [[ai_agents_for_business_automation | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### AI-Assisted Content and Programmatic SEO

[[ai_in_writing_frameworks_and_systems | AI-assisted content]] creation, such as with a "boring marketer" approach, is a growing area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. Agencies are increasingly focusing on programmatic SEO, leveraging a one-to-two-year window of opportunity before search changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

### Creative as an X-Factor

The creative aspect is becoming an increasingly important "X-factor" in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. Finding genuinely good creative agencies remains challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.

## Business Model: Pay-for-Performance

A compelling business model for these agencies is "pay-for-performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This model ensures clients only pay when the agency delivers results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Key aspects of this model include:
*   **Risk Mitigation for Clients**: Clients avoid long-term commitments and only pay for conversions or leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Higher Value Capture for Marketers**: Good marketers who are willing to take the risk can charge on performance and capture more value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Underwriting**: In an [[ai_agents_and_platforms | AI]] and data-rich world, marketers have more data to underwrite opportunities and bet on specific outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Examples of Success**:
    *   A pay-for-performance agency in the finance industry generates $80 million annually with $30 million in profit with only about 30 employees, focusing on running paid ads and building tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   Another agency, focusing on telecoms, grew to over $1 billion in revenue by driving leads through Google Ads and eventually acquiring call centers to "gift wrap" customers for major telecom companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Application to AI Transformation**: Agencies can propose saving companies money through [[ai_agents_for_business_automation | AI agents]] and take a percentage of the cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Alternatively, they can focus on generating new value (e.g., more customers) and charge upfront for that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)**: A pay-for-performance CRO agency could take a percentage of the increased revenue if they double a client's e-commerce conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Future Integration with Smart Contracts

The speaker envisions a future where "smart contracts" could automate pay-for-performance agreements, ensuring transparency and fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This would involve money being held in escrow and released automatically upon meeting performance targets, or returned to the customer if targets are not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This eliminates the need to trust a third party and solves issues like clients defaulting on payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Outlook on Agencies

Despite traditional views that agencies don't scale well, the speaker is bullish on the agency model, especially with the deflationary nature of [[ai_agents_and_platforms | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Agencies can achieve significant valuations (e.g., 15-20x EBITDA for good agencies at $5 million EBITDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. They can also generate substantial annual profit, essentially providing an "exit" each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. The agency model provides a strong "engine" for building cool products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>, including the ability to incubate software products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.

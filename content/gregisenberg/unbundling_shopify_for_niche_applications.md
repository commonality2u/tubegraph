The concept of "Shopify for X" is highlighted as a significant business idea, stemming from the observation that [[Shopify app ecosystem | Shopify]], an $80 billion company, presents numerous opportunities for unbundling its functionalities into more specific, niche-focused tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## The "Shopify for X" Idea

This idea, proposed by Danny Grant, suggests building product-specific no-code tools that cater to highly focused needs, much like Shopify serves as a no-code e-commerce platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Existing no-code tools are often criticized for being either too limited or overly complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

### Examples of Unbundled Shopify Ideas

The "Shopify for X" concept envisions specialized no-code builders for:
*   [[building_a_vertical_saas_business | No-code marketplaces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>
*   Building an Airbnb-style marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>
*   Creating a messaging app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>
*   Developing an Instagram-like app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>

The speaker expresses strong approval for these ideas, stating that such solutions "need to exist, should exist, will exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

### Implementation Considerations

While platforms like Bubble already offer components of this, the vision is to create a marketplace for no-code apps where users can duplicate existing ideas and pay a monthly or one-time license fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. This approach aligns with the trend of [[building_a_vertical_saas_business | vertical SaaS]] and [[microsaas_business_ideas | MicroSaaS]], by [[identifying_a_niche_audience_for_saas_products | identifying a niche audience]] and offering a tailored product. The overall direction of the market appears to be moving towards such specialized no-code tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

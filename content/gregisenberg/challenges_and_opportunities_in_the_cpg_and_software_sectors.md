## Building Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) Businesses

Justin Mayers, founder of Kettle and Fire, a consumer packaged goods (CPG) business that grew to a nine-figure annual business, shares insights into validating and building a CPG product. His experience highlights both the [[building_a_consumer_packaged_goods_business | challenges and opportunities in the CPG industry]].

### Validating a CPG Idea: The Kettle and Fire Case Study

In 2014, while at Rackspace, Mayers wanted to start his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. He had heard about bone broth from friends in the CrossFit community and had been reading about its benefits for skin, gut, and joint health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. At the time, bone broth was not widely discussed, nor was it easily found online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

His primary questions were:
1.  How many people genuinely want this product? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
2.  Are there enough interested people, or will they spend enough to make it a meaningful business? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>

Mayers's validation process involved several steps:
*   **Community Research:** He investigated online communities such as Mark's Daily Apple, Paleo Hacks, and Reddit, observing traffic and engagement in discussions about bone broth and its health benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. He noted a "fanatic" and interested group of people discussing recipes and sourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Trend Analysis:** He used Google Trends to observe the macro-level interest in bone broth, noting it was "starting to take off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   While some argue against using tools like Google Trends for startup ideas, Mayers emphasizes that he was addressing his own problem and passion, using trends merely to validate a decent business opportunity beyond a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. If no sign of life was found, he would not have proceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Demand Validation (Pre-Product):** To test willingness to pay, he created a minimal setup:
    *   Purchased the cheapest bone broth domain name (Bone Broths Co.com) for $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    *   Hired a Fiverr freelancer for $5 to create a logo and renders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   Built a simple landing page using Unbounce, highlighting value propositions such as healing leaky gut, convenience (compared to 24-48 hour home cooking), organic ingredients, and 100% grass-fed bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   Set a price of $29.99 for 16 ounces, significantly higher than typical grocery store broth, to ensure profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    *   Set up the "order now" button to direct customers to his personal PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
    *   Spent approximately $100 on Bing Ads (cheaper than Google Adwords) to drive traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
    *   Within a two-week test, despite a "super sketchy checkout flow" and no actual product, he observed paying customers and achieved a 30% conversion rate on the order button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. He made almost $500 in revenue, spending around $250 on ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This validated that people would pay for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Customer Engagement Post-Validation:** After validation, he emailed all customers who had placed an order, explaining there was no product yet. He offered a full refund or a 50% discount for those willing to wait for the product, which eventually took eight months to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Most customers opted for the discount, showing strong interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

This validation process provided confidence to proceed with the significant effort of manufacturing and scaling a CPG business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

## Opportunities in CPG vs. Software

When asked about opportunities in CPG versus software, Mayers emphasizes that the choice is personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. He suggests that individuals should focus on areas where they are genuinely passionate and on the "frontier" of interest, like the "top 0.1% of people interested in a topic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This natural interest leads to more novel and interesting ideas because one spends a lot of time in that space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. His success in CPG (Kettle and Fire, Shirley Wine, keto, non-alcoholic products) stems from his deep interest in improving human health and solving the chronic disease crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

He advises people to find a problem that truly ignites their interest and "circle that problem for a while" until interesting solutions emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Addressing important problems, such as health, can lead to successful businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

## Impact of AI on Startup Development

Looking at 2025, Mayers notes that AI tools significantly reduce the barriers to entry for startups across both CPG and software sectors, creating new [[opportunities and challenges in the AI industry | opportunities and challenges in the AI industry]].

### Opportunities for CPG
*   **Enhanced Design & Marketing:** The landing pages, logos, and product renders that were "terrible" in 2015 can now be dramatically improved with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. AI can generate high-quality designs that previously cost agencies tens of thousands of dollars, collapsing costs to as little as $20 a month (e.g., for ChatGPT Pro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.
*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Tools like Bolt.new can help build landing pages quickly, allowing a startup to be launched in "like a day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

### Opportunities for Software (and general startup development)
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** AI and other tools can quickly scrape and analyze sentiment across Reddit, forums, and Twitter, providing deeper insights into consumer needs and discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Validation:** The core principle of selling a product before it exists remains valid, but AI tools make the process faster and more sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Individual Empowerment:** AI tools empower individuals with a strong vision to build products and businesses that previously required larger teams. A "one guy in a basement" can now build products as good as, if not better than, those that took "tons of people" to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.
*   **Key AI Tools Mentioned:**
    *   Bolt.new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>
    *   Rok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>
    *   Frontier models like Claude, GPT, Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
*   **High Leverage Skill:** Becoming a "top 1% user" of these AI tools is considered one of the highest leverage activities for future business builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Rapid Testing:** With AI tools, one can test dozens of startup ideas per month to find the right one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

### General Principles
Regardless of the sector, the core principles of understanding pain points, validating the market, and distilling data remain crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. AI simplifies the process of data distillation and content creation, allowing for clearer communication of problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

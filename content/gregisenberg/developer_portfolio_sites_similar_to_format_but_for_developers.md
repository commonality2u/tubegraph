The concept of creating specialized portfolio sites for developers, akin to how Format.com serves creative professionals, was proposed as a startup idea by Danny Grant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. The speaker holds Danny Grant's ideas in high regard, noting she "knows where the world is going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## The Idea: "Danny Town" for Developers

Danny Grant's specific suggestion is to "help every developer create their own Danny town" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>, implying a personalized, aesthetically pleasing website for showcasing their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This directly mirrors Format.com, which is a portfolio builder specifically for creative professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

## Why Not GitHub?

While [[using_github_and_templates_for_app_development | GitHub]] exists and is widely used by developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>, the speaker argues that it is "not as beautiful as a format" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. There is a perceived opportunity to create a more visually appealing and curated experience for developers to present their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

## Business Potential

The business model of Format.com itself suggests significant potential:
*   Format.com serves over 50,000 paying users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
*   Their pricing is $12 a month (annually) or $24 a month (monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   At an assumed average of $15 a month, this translates to roughly $750,000 in monthly recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   Website builders are considered "beautiful businesses" because users, once they build their site, are unlikely to churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Website Builders for Niches
> Website builders, while seemingly "so 1999," still work "really well for different niches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. A notable example is Card.co, a one-page website builder, which was bootstrapped by a single developer to serve millions of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

## Building the Product

The suggested approach to building such a platform involves:
1.  **Creator-Led Strategy:** Similar to partnering with product managers for product spec tools, this idea could leverage well-known developers with large followings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
2.  **Start with Bespoke Designs:** Begin by designing one "really awesome developer portfolio site" for a few developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. The goal is to create something "unique [and] interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a> that excites the users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.
3.  **Refine and Productize:** Once these initial designs are refined, the product can be built as a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a> and then offered for a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

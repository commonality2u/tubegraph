## AI for Non-Designers
The goal of AI design tools is to enable individuals without prior design knowledge to create significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Much of the content created using AI tools like Midjourney and ChatGPT is not specifically for designers but rather for anyone with a subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Having good taste helps, but there's no "skill issue" for non-creatives when using these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Key AI Tools for Graphic Design

The generative AI phase includes various realms, such as image and video generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. While many tools exist, focusing on a few powerful ones is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Midjourney: Artistic Styling and Image Generation
Midjourney is a primary tool for generating images, often serving as the starting point for video creation by providing a base reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

*   **Styling Prowess**: It excels at artistic styling, allowing users to generate images with specific aesthetic directions, such as vintage aerial photos or surfer-style visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Image and Style References**:
    *   **Image Prompts**: Inserting a photo (image prompt) influences the content of the generated image (e.g., adding a person or object) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
    *   **Style References**: Uploading a style reference image ensures the generated image adopts similar colors, shadows, highlights, and depth of field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Mixing Styles**: Users can combine different style references to create surprising and unique generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### ChatGPT: The Prompt Architect
ChatGPT is crucial for generating effective prompts, which are essential for guiding AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

*   **Demystifying Prompting**: Prompting is no longer an exclusive skill for authors; ChatGPT can generate well-crafted prompts, even for complex descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Contextual Understanding**: ChatGPT understands the specific AI tool being used (e.g., Midjourney, Runway) and tailors the prompt format accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
*   **Iterative Prompting**: Users can have a conversation with ChatGPT, refining prompts to get very specific outputs (e.g., zoomed-in shots of a cowboy's hat or a horse's face) while maintaining a consistent style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Collection Generation**: ChatGPT can dream up entire collections of scenes that tie back to an initial concept, adding rich details without explicit instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Runway & Cling: Adding Motion and Sound
These tools specialize in transforming static images into dynamic videos.

*   **Runway**: Used to add motion to images, generating videos generally 5 to 10 seconds long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. ChatGPT can generate prompts that guide Runway on what movements to create (e.g., soft water ripples, smoke movement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Cling**: Another image-to-video tool that allows for start and end frames, enabling seamless video looping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. It also offers AI-generated sound options based on the video's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Continuous Shots**: By saving the last frame of a video as an image and using it as the starting frame for the next generation, users can create continuous, longer shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. These can then be stitched together using simple video editing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

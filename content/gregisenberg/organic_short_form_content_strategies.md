From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

David Park, founder of Jenny AI, grew his startup from zero to $10 million ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) in a few years, largely due to an "incredible growth tactic Playbook" that he shares freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This playbook is considered one of the most comprehensive for growth marketing, particularly for an AI startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. His approach emphasizes organic short-form content, influencer marketing, SEO, and paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## The Power of "Fresh Accounts"
Traditional social media emphasized clout through follower counts or checkmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. However, in the current landscape, a new account with zero followers can go viral immediately if the content resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

*   **No Hyperbole:** Cases exist where founders post a single video on TikTok that instantly goes viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This includes direct advertisements for products, especially for AI startups where the product itself can be a "spectacle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **A/B Testing Results:** Jenny AI conducted A/B tests posting identical content on their main account (70,000 followers) and a new account (50 followers). The smaller account frequently surpassed the engagement and views of the larger one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Sponsoring Fresh Accounts:** It is often more advantageous to sponsor a new account that is currently being boosted by the algorithm and shows strong resonance with content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. These "fresh accounts" are also significantly cheaper to sponsor (e.g., 1/100th of the price of established YouTubers), making it easier to achieve a positive ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Creating Engaging Content

### Finding a Face / Multiplier Accounts
Instead of only sponsoring new accounts, businesses can create these accounts themselves by partnering with a creator to be the "face" of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

*   **Creator Benefits:** This model allows creators to avoid "polluting" their main account with ads while still getting paid for content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Example: Ming May Duck:** David partnered with Ming May Duck, who had 300,000 followers on TikTok, paying him $4,000 per month for 20 videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
    *   **Overlap:** Jenny AI was a writing tool, and Ming May Duck taught people how to write emails, creating a natural audience overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
    *   **Results:** The new account, started from scratch, reached 70,000 followers and generated approximately half a billion views, with 7 million impressions in the first month alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This demonstrated a "quite good ROI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
    *   **Commitment:** The initial commitment was around three months, which is beneficial for testing the channel without long-term lock-ins, while providing consistent revenue for the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
    *   **Efficiency:** Creators can produce 20 videos a month with minimal daily time (5-10 minutes) by recording new hooks and using pre-supplied screen grabs/product videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

### Crafting a Viral Video Series
The goal is to find a viral video and turn it into a repeatable series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. People often prefer similar content repeatedly, making it easier to leverage a successful format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

*   **Concept:** Once a video goes viral, the strategy is to "squeeze as much of the upside" as possible by re-filming essentially the same content with minor variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Physical Challenge Series:** A creator testing how many spaghetti sticks, coat hangers, or sheets of paper it takes to hold their weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.
    *   **"For Every Follower I Have, I'll Do X" Series:** Gambling money or drinking milk based on follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
    *   **Jenny AI's "POV: You Have an Essay Due" Series:** Featured a relatable scenario of suddenly remembering an essay deadline, always ending with Jenny AI providing a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This series alone generated over 300 million views and $500,000 in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

### The Importance of Format-Product Fit
Going viral for the sake of it is "empty calories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. The viral series format must align with the product to drive conversions.

*   **Conversion vs. Views:** A video with 50,000 views can generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue if it's targeted, while a 20 million-view video might have a negligible effect on conversions if the audience isn't right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
*   **Direct Approach:** Even if a video looks like a "straight-up ad" and gets fewer views, it will convert better because it directly addresses a pain point that the product solves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.

## The Order of Virality (Playbook)
This sequential playbook outlines the steps to maximize organic short-form content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>:

1.  **Multiple Accounts:** Instead of one account per platform, create and "farm" multiple accounts (e.g., seven accounts on each platform, totaling 24 accounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
2.  **Experimentation:** Continuously experiment with diverse hooks, video ideas, and content angles (skits, memes, educational content, straight-up ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Post frequently (one or more videos per day) to rapidly test and iterate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. This is like taking "shots on goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.
3.  **Identify Viral Content:** After enough experimentation, a video will go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. Research competitors and other industries for trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
4.  **Create a Series:** Turn the viral video into a repeatable series by tweaking it slightly for continuous posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
5.  **Scale Across Accounts:** Post the winning series on multiple accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. This greatly expands the "surface area of luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
6.  **Internationalization:** Translate and recreate successful videos with creators speaking other languages (e.g., Chinese, Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. These can perform very well based on conversion tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.
7.  **Sponsor Reposts:** At the "tail end of the cycle," pay other pages (like Instagram meme pages) to repost your viral videos, giving them a "second life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
8.  **Paid Ads Integration:** Use the best-performing organic content for [[paid_ads_strategies | paid ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. This leverages data from organic performance to inform [[paid_ads_strategies | paid ad]] targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>.
9.  **Cycle End & Restart:** Eventually, copycats and audience fatigue will cause the series to "play out." At this point, return to step one to research new hooks and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Don't be afraid to post the same video multiple times a day if it performs well. While 5x a day sounds excessive, views prove its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## Finding and Negotiating with Influencers
The non-sexy answer to finding influencers is to talk to users and ask them who they follow in your product's niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

*   **User Research:** Directly ask users for their social media handles and observe who they follow and interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. This reveals true "influencers" who genuinely influence behavior, not just those with high follower counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.
*   **Algorithmic Discovery:**
    1.  Create a new Instagram or TikTok account.
    2.  Manually follow initial target influencers.
    3.  Watch their videos all the way through.
    4.  The algorithm will then "automatically show you other influencers" in the same niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. This method helps discover "crazy steals" â€“ creators with few followers but amazing content potential who might go viral soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. Sponsoring someone who appeared on your "For You Page" when you weren't following them indicates their content has algorithmic potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
*   **Outreach Playbook:**
    1.  **Utilize All Avenues:** Use DMs, emails, LinkedIn, blogs, or even Venmo (sending a small amount) to reach out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. The harder it is to find their contact, the more impressed they might be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.
    2.  **Be Detailed but Concise:** Messages should be tailored, demonstrating genuine appreciation for their content and explaining why a partnership would benefit them and their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. Avoid discussing funding rounds or employee numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.
    3.  **Clearly State "Paid Promotion":** Influencers are constantly offered free products; explicitly stating it's a paid promotion makes them take it seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
    4.  **Expect Low Response Rates:** Assume most won't respond, especially early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. Tougher skin allows for better optimization of outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. As your product gains recognition, it becomes easier to secure partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
*   **Negotiation Strategy:**
    1.  **Align Incentives:** Structure payments so a percentage is tied to conversions or views, encouraging influencers to create effective content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
    2.  **Transparency:** Be upfront about budget and ROI expectations, and ask them to be transparent about their demographics and past sponsored video performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.
    3.  **Negotiate Down from the Top:** Inquire about the most expensive package (e.g., "Link in Bio," Instagram story, all short-form accounts, full usage rights, product-focused video). Then, remove elements that are not essential to reduce the price to a fairer rate. Finally, suggest a bulk deal for multiple videos per month at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
    4.  **Ignore Follower-Based Pricing:** Articles suggesting pricing based on follower count are "garbage misinformation" that leads to overpaying and poor ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

## Posting Content and Scaling
The "one-size-fits-all" strategy doesn't work; content must align with the influencer's cultivated audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.

*   **Trust the Influencer:** If inexperienced, trust the influencer to create content similar to their usual posts, simply incorporating your product at a specified timestamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.
*   **Leverage Existing Series:** If an influencer has a popular series (e.g., "Top 10 AI Tools That Feel Illegal to Know"), aim to be inserted into that series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>.
*   **Scaling and Autopilot:** To scale influencer marketing (e.g., a video every few hours), it's crucial to trust influencers and provide a clear blueprint (how to talk about the product, required time, desired views/engagement). Package deals for multiple videos per month allow for "set and forget" management, reducing micromanagement needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. Jenny AI manages 50-100k USD per month in influencer marketing with only two people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>.
*   **Views vs. Conversions:** Views are irrelevant if they don't convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. Don't be afraid of a video looking like a "straight-up ad" if it clearly addresses a pain point; these often convert better, even with fewer views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.

## Broader Takeaways

*   **Balance Creative and Managerial Skills:** Success in organic short-form content requires both understanding creative content and efficiently managing campaigns, tracking data, and fostering real relationships with creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
*   **Use Every Advantage:** Leverage personal connections or common ground to build rapport and increase response rates from creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Iteration:** Organic content (and influencer marketing) offers fast iteration cycles, allowing quick testing of resonance and adaptation, unlike [[seo_strategies_for_brand_growth | SEO]] or [[paid_ads_strategies | paid ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.
*   **Growth from $5M to $10M ARR:** The strategies listed (organic content, influencer marketing, [[seo_strategies_for_brand_growth | SEO]], [[paid_ads_strategies | paid ads]]) remained core to Jenny AI's growth from $5 million to $10 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. Key additions included:
    *   **Affiliate Marketing:** A significant portion of revenue came from affiliate marketers championing Jenny AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
    *   **Acquisitions:** Acquiring other startups and applying Jenny AI's learned growth strategies to double their revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Retention and Conversion:** Significant effort was put into improving the conversion funnel and reducing churn (e.g., from 20% to 9.8% churn for a B2C AI app, which is a major accomplishment given high churn rates in the sector) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.
    *   **Delayed Gratification:** SEO and [[paid_ads_strategies | paid ads]] are not recommended for day one; they are better for established businesses with stable income streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The ultimate secret to success with these strategies is implementation. Many people will read the playbook but few will consistently implement and iterate for a year despite setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.

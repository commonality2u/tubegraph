David Park's AI startup, Jenny AI, grew from zero to $10 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) using an "incredible growth tactic Playbook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This playbook, considered "the most comprehensive best Playbook that I have seen on growth marketing for an AI startup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, was revealed, detailing strategies including paid ads, [[seo_strategies_for_startups | SEO]], and influencer marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. One of the core elements of this success was a focus on [[the_importance_of_organic_content_for_messaging | organic short form content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Leveraging Organic Short-Form Content

The key to growth lies in understanding and exploiting the current landscape of social media algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### "Fresh" Accounts vs. Established Accounts

Contrary to traditional belief, social media clout from millions of followers or checkmarks is not as significant as it once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Founders can create a single video on platforms like TikTok that can immediately go [[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | viral]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Even a direct ad for a product can gain 10,000, 100,000, or a million views if the hook and content are high-quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

Experiments at Jenny AI showed that identical content posted on a main account with 70,000 followers and a fresh account with 50 followers could result in the smaller account achieving more engagement or views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This indicates that a "fresh account" with minimal followers can outperform an account with millions if its content resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This is because the algorithm might be "juicing" the fresh account, pushing its content to a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Sponsoring Fresh Accounts

It's often more beneficial to sponsor a fresh account than a large YouTuber with a million subscribers if they have similar view counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Fresh accounts can be paid significantly less (e.g., 1/100th of the price) because established YouTubers often expect high fees (e.g., $20,000 for a 30-second video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. New creators are often excited to be paid for content they'd produce for free, creating a win-win situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Creating Your Own Accounts

Instead of solely finding and sponsoring new accounts, businesses can create these accounts themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The strategy involves having a creator become the "face" of the product on a new, fresh account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This allows the creator to educate viewers about pain points the product solves or offer helpful advice without "polluting" their main account with ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

At Jenny AI, David Park partnered with Ming Duck, who had 300,000 followers on TikTok, paying him $4,000 a month for 20 videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This new account started from zero followers and grew to 70,000 followers, generating half a billion views across platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. In the first month alone, they garnered 7 million impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. A single [[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | viral]] video with one million views can add thousands in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) to a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

Producing 20 videos a month may seem daunting, but it can be framed as just 3-6 hours of work per month for a creator, especially if the company provides screen grabs and product videos, requiring the creator only to brainstorm new hooks and record themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

### The Importance of Frequent Posting & Iteration

When working with a new creator, the basic guideline is to:
*   Repost videos on all platforms (Reels, TikTok, Shorts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   Post one or more videos per day initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   Post videos similar to what the influencer typically posts on their main account, then experiment with product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

The frequency of posting allows for continuous exploration and testing of hooks and content angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Instead of just four tests per month (one video per week), daily posting provides numerous opportunities to experiment with different formats (skits, memes, educational content, direct ads), angles, and text on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This iterative process helps identify winning content variations that can eventually lead to a "Mega Banger" video with 1 to 10 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

### Crafting a Viral Video Series

The ultimate goal with a creator is to find a [[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | viral]] series, as a video that goes viral once is likely to go viral again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. People are creatures of habit and often want to see similar content repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Once a [[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | viral]] video is found, the focus shifts to maximizing its upside by creating variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

For Jenny AI, a popular series was "POV you have a paper or an essay due," featuring relatable scenarios where someone realizes they have an essay due and Jenny AI helps them write it faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This type of content, even with minimal effort in re-recording the initial hook, can continually go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

#### Format-Product Fit
It's crucial to have "format product fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Going [[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | viral]] for its own sake is "empty calories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. The content and the product must align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. For example, a video showing someone drinking milk for every thousand followers wouldn't work for Jenny AI but would for a dairy company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. Jenny AI had a video with 20 million views that had a negligible effect on conversions because it didn't align with the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

### The "Order of Virality" Playbook
1.  **Farm Multiple Accounts:** Instead of one account per platform, create multiple accounts on each platform (e.g., seven accounts on each, totaling 24 accounts posting daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
2.  **Experiment:** Continuously experiment with hooks and video ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Observe competitors and general trends to find what catches attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
3.  **Go Viral:** Through experimentation, a video will eventually go [[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | viral]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
4.  **Turn into a Series:** Transform the [[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | viral]] video into a series, tweaking it repeatedly for continuous posting and viewer engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
5.  **Scale Across Accounts:** Start tweaking and posting the [[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | viral]] series on multiple accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
6.  **Localize:** Translate and recreate the same video content with creators who speak different languages (e.g., Chinese, Spanish) to reach new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
7.  **Sponsor Reposts:** At the tail end of a content cycle, pay other pages (like meme pages on Instagram) to repost [[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | viral]] videos for a "second life" with lesser but still significant reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
8.  **Use for Paid Ads:** Leverage mega-viral content for paid advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
9.  **Return to Step One:** Eventually, copycats will play out the video series, and it will become less effective, requiring a return to researching new hooks and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

The "POV you have an essay due" video series generated over 300 million views for Jenny AI, essentially using the same video repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. This one series alone generated half a million dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

### Finding Influencers

The non-sexy answer to finding influencers is to identify those your users watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Talk to Users:** Ask users directly about the influencers they follow related to your product's niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. Observing who they follow and interact with provides genuine insights into who truly influences them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   **Algorithm as an Agency:** Create a new Instagram or TikTok account and manually follow a list of relevant influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Watch their videos all the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>. The algorithm will then automatically suggest other influencers in the same niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. This "hack" can help discover new creators with amazing content and low follower counts, potentially leading to "craziest deals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. Sponsoring someone whose video appeared on your "For You" page (without following them) indicates their content has the capacity to be pushed to non-follower accounts, reducing the risk of a dud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

### Reaching Out to Influencers

*   **Multi-Channel Approach:** Use all available avenues: DMs, emails, LinkedIn, or even obscure platforms like old blogs or Tumblr accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. Finding less common contact methods makes your outreach stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.
*   **Personalized and Concise:** Messages should be detailed and tailored, demonstrating genuine interest in their content, but also concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. Avoid discussing irrelevant details like funding rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.
*   **Acknowledge Paid Promotion:** Clearly state that it is a paid promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. Influencers are often bombarded with offers of free product or subs, so clarifying it's paid makes your offer more serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.
*   **Expect Low Response Rates:** Be prepared for most messages not to receive a response, especially early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. Developing thick skin helps optimize outreach rather than getting discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.
*   **Leverage Brand Growth:** As your product gains recognition and your social media presence grows, it becomes easier to convince other creators to partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.

### Negotiating with Influencers

*   **Align Incentives:** Structure payments so a percentage is tied to conversions or views, ensuring both parties benefit from a high-performing video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. Avoid paying all money upfront to retain leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
*   **Transparency:** Be transparent about your budget and expected ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. Ask influencers to be transparent about their demographics and past sponsored video performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.
*   **Negotiate Down from the Top:** Ask for the highest possible price for a comprehensive package (e.g., link in bio, Instagram story, all short-form accounts, full usage rights) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. Then, negotiate by removing elements you don't need (e.g., usage rights, specific platforms) to arrive at a fair price for a single video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. Once a single video price is established, negotiate a bulk deal (e.g., three videos per month at a 20% discount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **Ignore Follower-Based Pricing:** Do not base payment on follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. This is common misinformation that leads to overpaying for limited ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

### Posting Content

*   **Tailor to Influencer's Style:** Sponsored content should not deviate too far from the influencer's established style, as their audience follows them for specific content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. If new to this, trust the influencer to create content similar to their usual posts, integrating the product at specific timestamps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.
*   **Integrate into Existing Series:** If an influencer has a popular series (e.g., "Top 10 AI tools that feel illegal to know"), aim to insert your product into that existing series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>.
*   **Scale and Autopilot:** To scale influencer marketing, aim to have a video promoting your product going out every few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. This requires trusting influencers with a clear blueprint (how to talk about the product, desired portrayal time, expected views/engagement) for consistent content production without constant micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>. This "set and forget" approach is crucial for efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>.
*   **Don't Fear Direct Ads:** While subtle integration can be appealing, don't be afraid for a video to look like a "straightup ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. Even if it gets fewer views, direct problem-solution framing ("Don't you hate when this happens? This will solve your issue") converts better by speaking directly to user pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.

### Growth from $5 Million to $10 Million ARR

The core strategies for [[b2b_growth_and_content_strategies | B2B growth and content strategies]] remain effective from $5 million to $10 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. However, scaling requires improvements in hiring and team building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>.

New channels added include:
*   **Affiliate Marketers:** A significant portion of revenue now comes from affiliates who champion Jenny AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   **Acquisitions:** Jenny AI has acquired other startups and successfully doubled their revenue within months by applying learned growth strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.
*   **Back to Basics:** Significant effort was put into improving retention and conversion rates across the user funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>. For example, monthly churn was reduced from 20% to 9.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. This is particularly challenging for B2C AI apps, where 30-50% monthly churn is not uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>. Improving these core metrics allows greater capitalization on existing traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.

Overall, the journey from $5 million to $10 million ARR involved refining existing strategies, scaling operations, making strategic acquisitions, and intensely focusing on fundamental metrics like retention and conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>.

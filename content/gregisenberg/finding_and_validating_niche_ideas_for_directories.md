Frey, an "online directory King," teaches how to build online directories that can generate between $2,000 and $10,000 in monthly passive income with only about 15 minutes of work per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. His first directory, built in October 2022, has been monetized for 18 months, requires about 15 minutes of maintenance per month, and earned around $2,300 in revenue last month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

The core process involves three steps: finding an idea, validating that idea, and then creating a basic directory optimized for [[using_seo_and_keyword_research_for_directory_success | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The goal is to choose a directory niche that actively solves a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Identifying Niche Ideas

A key method for [[identifying_a_niche_and_audience | identifying a niche]] is using Ahrefs' Keyword Explorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### Leveraging "Near Me" Queries
By typing "near me" into the Keyword Explorer, a long list of local queries with high search volume appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This approach helps in [[keyword_research_for_directories | keyword research for directories]] to find ideas with high monthly search volume and low keyword difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. While very large keywords might be too competitive, Frey's "sweet spot" for monthly searches is between 30,000 and 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. A keyword difficulty score under 20 is generally considered easy to rank for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

### Niches to Avoid
Frey recommends avoiding several types of niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>:
*   **Seasonal Niches** For example, "pumpkin patches near me" (152,000 monthly searches) is seasonal, making consistent monetization difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Data-Difficult Niches** Niches where data is hard to acquire, such as "earthquake near me," should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Branded Keywords** Keywords like "Taco Bell near me" are problematic because large brands likely already have updated directories, and the search intent is too one-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Identifying Multi-Dimensional Search Intent
The ideal niche has "fragmentation in the search intent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. For example, "dog parks near me" (73,000 monthly searches, keyword difficulty 27) is a strong candidate because people look for specific types of dog parks like "indoor dog park," "off-leash dog park," or "dog water park" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This indicates that existing solutions (like Google Maps) aren't fully satisfying users' needs, allowing for a more detailed and useful directory to capitalize on these specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This approach relates to [[choosing_high_impact_niches | choosing high impact niches]].

## Validating Niche Ideas

Once potential niches are identified, the next step is validation through competitive research and social listening. This helps in [[finding_and_addressing_niche_community_problems | finding and addressing niche community problems]].

### Competitive Research via Google
Perform Google searches for target keywords (e.g., "Dog Park Los Angeles") to identify existing directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. Analyze competitors like BringFido (a massive dog-related website) or smaller, more basic directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. A directory that is "super basic" but still receives significant traffic (e.g., 21,000 monthly visitors) indicates a strong opportunity for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. These "positive signals" show that a more comprehensive directory can "take that traffic from them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. Look for missing features or information that users would find helpful, such as details on dog bags, water fountains, or shade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

### Social Listening via Reddit
Use Reddit to confirm if the identified niche represents a problem worth solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. Search for keywords related to the niche (e.g., "Dog Park Los Angeles Reddit") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Look for discussions and forums where people are actively seeking information or expressing difficulties with existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. A post where someone manually compiled a Google Map of dog parks and users wished for more descriptions and photos, serves as a strong social signal for the need for curated, hyper-specific features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.

## Data Acquisition and Enrichment

After validating the niche, the next steps involve acquiring and enriching the data needed to build the directory.

### Data Acquisition
Web scraping tools like OutScraper (specifically its Google Map scraper) can be used to gather data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. Prioritize niches with dedicated Google categories (e.g., "dog park") for cleaner data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>. If a category doesn't exist, a plain query can be used, though it will result in more "junk data" that requires cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. For data cleaning, manual parsing (e.g., removing listings without addresses or with few reviews) combined with AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.

### Data Enrichment
Data enrichment is crucial for creating a more valuable directory that stands out from competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. This involves adding features identified during keyword research and competitive analysis (e.g., "indoor dog park," "off-leash dog park") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. Analyze Google Maps reviews for common tags and features (e.g., "shade," "parking," "water," "benches," "dog bags") to identify what users frequently mention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. While manual data enrichment is possible, it is tedious for large datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>. Automated tools, like the one Frey is developing, can read Google URLs and analyze reviews to flag specific features (e.g., "shade: true"), saving significant time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>. This deep level of detail is what will set a new directory apart and bring users back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

## Building and Monetizing the Directory

Even a simple, static pillar page directory can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. These "level one" directory builds can leverage [[using_seo_and_keyword_research_for_directory_success | SEO]] principles by creating comprehensive pages targeting city-specific keywords (e.g., "Dog Park Long Beach") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>. The most searched pages on programmatic directories are often location-based pages, reinforcing the value of this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.

The simple format is "perfect for display ad monetization" due to its length, allowing for many ad placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. This "mailbox money" can cover bills, allowing founders to pursue other ventures or build larger ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>. The foundation of a directory can lead to significant [[monetizing_online_directories | monetization strategies for online directories]], such as building SaaS products on top of the directory, or leveraging affiliate plays and lead magnets to collect data, as seen with companies like BarkBox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. The [[opportunities_in_niche_websites | opportunities in niche websites]] like online directories are "extremely underrated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.

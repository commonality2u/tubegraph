Frey, an experienced online directory builder, teaches a method for [[building_a_profitable_online_directory | building online directories]] that can generate between $2,000 and $10,000 a month in passive income with minimal weekly maintenance [00:00:08]. His approach focuses on [[identifying_and_selecting_a_profitable_niche | identifying and selecting a profitable niche]] and then [[validating_ideas_for_online_directories | validating that idea]] to ensure it solves a real problem [00:02:59].

## Frey's Approach to Online Directories

Frey's preferred directory model is based on evergreen, location-based niches [00:12:24]. These types of directories require less frequent data updates, making them easier to maintain over time [00:12:34]. He built his first directory in October 2022, which has been monetized for 18 months, takes about 15 minutes a month to maintain, and generated approximately $2,300 in revenue last month [00:01:27]. This method does not strictly require [[building_niche_marketplaces_with_aidriven_programmatic_seo | AI tools]], but they can be recommended for certain parts [00:02:25].

## Finding Niche Ideas

Frey outlines a systematic way to discover potential directory niches:

*   **Ahrefs Keyword Explorer** Use Ahrefs and type "near me" into the Keyword Explorer [00:12:43]. This reveals a long list of local queries with significant search volume [00:12:50].
*   **Targeting Search Volume and Keyword Difficulty**
    *   Look for keywords with high monthly search volume and low keyword difficulty [00:13:08].
    *   Frey's "sweet spot" for monthly searches is between 30,000 and 100,000 [00:13:20].
    *   Generally, a keyword difficulty under 20 is considered "pretty easy" [00:16:48]. However, keyword difficulty can be misleading; a low score might still indicate high competition or dominant backlinks [00:16:55]. If you know what you're doing, even 40-50 keyword difficulty can be possible [00:17:44].
*   **Identifying Multi-Dimensional Search Intent** Choose niches where the search intent is "multi-dimensional," meaning people are looking for specific types of results within the niche, not just a simple listing [00:15:49]. For example, "dog parks near me" is good because people search for "indoor dog park," "off-leash dog park," or features like water fountains, benches, or shade [00:15:40]. This allows for data enrichment to provide more useful information [00:16:16].

### Niches to Avoid

Frey also advises against certain types of niches:

*   **Seasonal Niches** Avoid niches that are highly seasonal, like "pumpkin patches near me" [00:13:40]. A website built with significant time and effort should monetize well for more than just a month [00:13:54].
*   **Difficult-to-Obtain Data** Stay away from niches where the data might be hard to acquire, such as "earthquake near me" [00:14:02].
*   **Big Branded Keywords** Do not target large branded keywords like "Taco Bell near me" [00:14:21].
    *   These brands likely already have updated directories [00:14:31].
    *   The search intent is often too "one-dimensional," meaning users aren't looking for varied information about the brand [00:14:52].

## Validating the Idea Through Competitive Research and Social Listening

After identifying a potential niche, Frey proceeds with validation:

*   **Competitive Research (Google)**
    *   Perform Google searches for keywords related to your niche (e.g., "Dog Park Los Angeles") [00:18:27].
    *   Identify existing directories on the first page of search results [00:18:40].
    *   Evaluate if you can improve upon existing directories. For example, a "super basic" dog park directory getting 21,000 monthly visitors, despite only showing names and addresses, presents an opportunity to add more useful features like amenities [00:19:52]. This indicates that current solutions (including Google Maps) are not fully satisfying user needs [00:21:13].
*   **Social Listening (Reddit)**
    *   Use Reddit to confirm if the identified niche represents a problem worth solving [00:23:35].
    *   Search for discussions related to your niche (e.g., "Dog Park Los Angeles Reddit") [00:23:44].
    *   Look for forums where people are actively seeking information or discussing difficulties related to the niche [00:23:54].
    *   Analyze comments to identify specific pain points or desires, such as the need for curation or hyper-specific features (e.g., "I wish I had time to visit all of them and make descriptions and take photos. Not all dog dog runs are created equal so it'd be cool to find out about really nice ones that aren't near nearby") [00:25:20]. These are "green flags" indicating a problem where a directory can add significant value [00:25:52].

### Example of Directory Websites and Their Success

Frey demonstrates the potential of directories by reviewing several examples:

*   **RoadsideAmerica.com**: A directory of quirky roadside attractions in the United States. Despite an outdated design, it receives 85,000 monthly visitors and generates an estimated $5,000-$7,000 per month passively through display ads [00:04:52]. It has also proven resilient to Google core updates [00:05:33].
*   **AtlasObscura.com**: A worldwide directory of off-the-beaten-path attractions. It receives over 1 million monthly visitors [00:07:29] and is estimated to make $30,000-$60,000 per month from display ads alone [00:07:58]. It also shows resilience to Google updates [00:07:34].
*   **FindAGrave.com**: A directory for finding burial sites. It garners 1.4 million monthly visitors [00:09:04] and is estimated to generate $60,000-$100,000 per month, primarily through AdSense [00:10:00]. This example highlights significant interest in niche-specific data [00:09:21].

## Next Steps After Validation

Once a niche is found and validated, the next steps involve data acquisition and implementation:

*   **Data Acquisition and Cleaning**: Use web scraping tools like Outs Scraper (not affiliated) to gather data from sources like Google Maps [00:27:41].
    *   Prioritize Google Map categories for cleaner data extraction [00:28:27]. If a category doesn't exist, a plain query can be used, though it will yield more junk data requiring extensive cleaning [00:29:04].
    *   Initial cleaning can involve removing listings without addresses or with very few reviews [00:30:05]. [[building_niche_marketplaces_with_aidriven_programmatic_seo | AI tools]] like ChatGPT can assist with data parsing, but manual review is often necessary to avoid losing valuable listings [00:30:28].
*   **Data Enrichment**: Enhance the raw data with additional features identified during the validation process (e.g., "shade," "benches," "water fountains" for dog parks) [00:35:22]. This can be done by manually reviewing Google Maps reviews for recurring tags or using automated tools (like one Frey is developing) that parse Google URLs for specific keywords in reviews [00:36:00]. This deeper information differentiates the directory from competitors and increases user retention [00:41:51].
*   **Implementation**: Create the directory website using a Content Management System (CMS) like WordPress or Framer [00:42:11]. Frey often uses a "static pillar page directory" format, where all content for a keyword cluster (e.g., "dog parks") is on one long page, targeting city-specific keywords (e.g., "dog park Long Beach") [00:43:30]. This format is effective for [[seo_optimization_for_directory_websites | SEO]] and [[monetizing_online_directories | display ad monetization]] due to the long pages accommodating many ad placements [00:46:27]. This simple approach can still achieve $2,000-$10,000 in monthly recurring revenue [00:47:52].

This foundational approach can lead to "mailbox money" â€” consistent passive income that covers bills [00:48:28], or it can serve as a base for building a larger business, potentially by layering software on top of the directory traffic to achieve SaaS multiples [00:48:55]. Directories are "extremely underrated" and an avenue often overlooked by tech founders [00:49:39].

## Promoting and Monetizing Directories

Beyond display ads, other [[monetizing_online_directories | monetization strategies]] and [[promoting_online_directories | promotion methods]] include:

*   **Selling Leads**: For programmatic directories, selling leads to service-based businesses [00:50:42].
*   **Affiliate Programs**: Especially in niches like the pet space, integrating affiliate programs (e.g., BarkBox) [00:50:57].
*   **Lead Magnets/Newsletters**: Collecting data and building an email list for a niche [[creating_niche_newsletters_for_professionals | newsletter]] or lead magnet to gather more information on users [00:51:36].

Reddit serves as a rich source for discovering validated startup ideas and can lead to the creation of multi-million dollar businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The platform provides a plethora of validated ideas, making it an ideal starting point for entrepreneurs seeking concepts with a high probability of resonating with an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This approach focuses on finding validated ideas that people will likely connect with and be willing to pay for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Four-Step Process to Find Gold on Reddit

The process to [[using_reddit_to_find_startup_ideas | find startup ideas from Reddit]] involves four key steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Step 1: Identify Trending Subreddits

The initial step involves using a tool called Gummy Search, which offers both free and paid plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
Within Gummy Search, navigate to the "trending" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While large subreddits are visible, the focus should be on subreddits with **10,000 to 100,000 members** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. These communities are generally newer, trending, and answer the "why now" question, indicating current relevance and potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

It's important to observe how fast these subreddits are growing daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. As you scroll through the list, identify subreddits that seem interesting and consider if you possess an "unfair advantage" or knowledge related to that niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Notes should be taken on potentially interesting communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The time frame for growth can also be adjusted (daily, weekly, monthly) to uncover different trending topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Gummy Search also provides curated sections for specific audiences, such as software engineers, though observing what's naturally growing is often more insightful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Step 2: Find Problems and Solutions within Subreddits

Once an interesting subreddit is selected, the next step is to identify existing problems and potential solutions within that community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This is crucial for developing a startup idea that can generate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Gummy Search simplifies this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

For example, by selecting the "dog food" subreddit and creating an "audience" for "people into dog food" (including similar subreddits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>:

*   **Pain and Anger**: Gummy Search organizes discussions into categories like "pain and anger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Clicking this section allows for identifying common patterns of frustration or unmet needs within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The tool uses [[leveraging_ai_for_business_ideas_and_revenue | AI]] to summarize thousands of words and find common patterns, which can spark business ideas (e.g., potty training challenges, dogs reluctant to walk, loss of appetite) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Advice Requests**: This category reveals what people are actively seeking help or recommendations for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. These are "people screaming they want these products to exist," indicating clear demand (e.g., dog breed recommendations, specific dog food recommendations for senior dogs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Solution Requests**: This section provides insights into the existing competitive landscape and how people are currently addressing their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This helps in understanding what products or solutions are already in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

Throughout this process, continuously take notes in a document, generating potential startup ideas (e.g., agency, SaaS, marketplace, software, brick-and-mortar, CPG businesses) and sketching out a "one-pager" for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Step 3: Research Niche Creators/Influencers

After outlining problems and solutions, identify key creators within the niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Use Perplexity.ai (a free tool) to prompt for lists of popular influencers or educational YouTubers in the chosen field (e.g., "25 most popular dog influencers on YouTube") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

Once identified, visit their [[leveraging_youtube_channels_and_podcasts_for_business_growth | YouTube channels]] and sort their videos by "most popular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Delve into the comments section of these popular videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. By reading the top comments, you can gain a deeper understanding of what people are thinking and what they truly desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This exercise, repeated for about 20-25 videos, adds further insights to your one-pager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### Step 4: Wireframe and Launch an MVP

With a clear understanding of problems, solutions, and community insights, the next step is to wireframe your potential product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This involves sketching out what the website or product would look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

For instance, if Reddit insights reveal frustration with designers who prioritize aesthetics over conversion, an idea for a design agency focused on "copy and conversion" might emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. A simple MVP (Minimum Viable Product) can be wireframed and launched quickly, perhaps in a few hours using a tool like Framer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

Consider a catchy name for the business, potentially drawing inspiration from subreddit insights. For example, "Design Science" emerged from the desire for designers to be "more like a scientist, less art, more science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. The goal is to build a simple product that can generate cash flow, potentially growing into a full-time venture or a significant startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

## Creating Content People Will Love

The same methodology used for finding startup ideas can be applied to create compelling content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

*   **Gummy Search's Top Content**: In Gummy Search, within your selected audience, navigate to the "Top Content" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. This reveals the best-performing content within that community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Observe common patterns, types of formats (e.g., long stories, memes), and what the audience cares about (e.g., stories about saving a dog's life) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Asking Questions**: Utilize Gummy Search's question-asking feature within the "Top Content," "Solution Requests," or "Pain and Anger" sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Asking questions like "Do they love memes?" can provide insights into the community's communication style and preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. Gummy Search acts as an "entrepreneurial assistant" that helps connect dots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

This observation-based method allows you to "teleport" to different communities and observe, write, and generate ideas that will resonate with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This methodology has been shown to result in seven-figure businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

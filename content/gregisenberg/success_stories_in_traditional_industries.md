Many individuals are achieving significant wealth by building and growing "boring, sweaty businesses" rather than pursuing high-tech startups [00:00:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. According to Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," the wealthy individuals he knows, who own private jets and large beach houses, almost invariably made their fortunes in traditional, often overlooked, sectors [00:01:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Why Choose Traditional Businesses?

While new, innovative ideas are valuable, pursuing "normal" or "boring" businesses can significantly increase one's odds of becoming wealthy [00:02:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The competition in these sectors is often less intense compared to the crowded tech and AI startup landscape, where many ventures fail [00:24:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. This approach focuses on competing against less sophisticated businesses, increasing the likelihood of success and profitability [00:24:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. This represents a significant [[advantages_of_starting_a_traditional_business | advantage of starting a traditional business]].

## Nick Huber's Journey: From Student Storage to Self-Storage

Nick Huber's own [[success_stories_from_replit_users | success stories]] exemplify the potential of traditional businesses.

### Storage Squad
Huber started a pickup and delivery storage business called Storage Squad, catering to students during summer breaks [00:02:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: Students' boxes were stored in a warehouse and returned to them when they moved back [00:02:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: The primary and almost exclusive marketing method was sidewalk chalk, placed in high-traffic student areas on campus [00:02:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Huber personally wrote chalk ads over 5,000 times [00:03:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping**: The business was bootstrapped with a $1,500 cargo van and a $2,200 box truck [00:03:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Financials**: At its peak, Storage Squad generated $2.2 million in annual revenue and $400k-$500k in profit [00:03:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Exit**: The business was sold in 2020 for $1.75 million with no debt [00:04:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Origin**: The idea originated when someone on Craigslist, looking to lease Huber's apartment, instead asked to store their belongings in it [00:04:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Within three weeks of this initial idea, Huber had $3,000 cash, and the business was profitable from day one [00:05:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Self-Storage Facilities
Leveraging the success of Storage Squad, Huber transitioned into self-storage:
*   **First Acquisition**: In 2019, a neglected 40,000 sq ft self-storage facility with 180+ units was bought at public auction for $625,000 [00:05:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It was generating only $4,000/month [00:05:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Second Acquisition**: Another self-storage facility in North Georgia was purchased for $1.5 million, earning $15,600-$16,000/month at the time [00:06:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Today, this facility generates $40,000/month and is valued at $4.5 million, an increase of over $2 million [00:06:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This growth was achieved without inventing anything, raising money, or doing anything "spectacular" [00:06:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Examples of [[bluecollar_startups_and_how_to_grow_them | Bluecollar Startups]]

Numerous traditional businesses offer significant profit potential:

*   **Lawn Care**: Huber's brother runs a lawn care company that generates over $100,000 annually. His only marketing is "bandit signs" (roadside signs) that bring in 30-40 new customers in April/May each year [00:07:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. He works nine months a year, spending winters fishing [00:07:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Mobile Detailing**: A mobile detailing business, "Detailed Dogs," generated $17,000 in revenue and $10,000 in profit in one month, equating to $120,000 annually for a one-year college graduate [00:08:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **High-End Airport Transportation**: A business offering high-end transportation to the airport, run by a friend of Huber's, does "really well" [00:08:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Firewood Delivery**: An [[innovative_business_ideas_and_models | innovative business idea]] for firewood delivery involves building on-site firewood racks for customers, costing about $100 in materials and 1.5 hours to build [00:08:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This allows charging $800-$1,000 for delivery and installation, potentially yielding $1,000 profit for two deliveries a day [00:08:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This could also become a recurring subscription service and an entry point for other services like lawn mowing or tree work [00:09:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **In-Bar Advertising Displays**: A business in North Georgia charges $10/month per business to display rotating ads on TVs in 70 bars and restaurants, netting $20,000/month [00:10:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. This model fosters loyalty among local business owners, who enjoy seeing their ads displayed [00:11:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Putting Green Installation**: This higher-skilled business can generate $30,000 to $200,000 for high-end turf installations at residential properties [00:11:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Tree Removal**: Despite risks and equipment costs, tree removal is highly profitable. Two workers spent four hours removing two trees from Huber's house, earning over $3,000 [00:12:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Christmas Light Installation**: While risky, this seasonal business can be very lucrative, with some clients paying $3,500-$4,000 for a few rows of lights for three months [00:12:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Power Washing**: An accessible business with low skill and startup costs, power washing can clean concrete, furniture, and decks [00:12:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Concrete Work (Driveways, Patios)** [00:13:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>
*   **Bounce House Rentals** [00:13:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>

## Digital "Sweaty" Startups and [[opportunities_in_niche_markets | Niche Opportunities]]

The concept of a "sweaty startup" can also apply to digital businesses with a service-oriented foundation:

*   **Nanny Recruiting Company**: A significant need exists for local nanny recruiting companies that handle job posting, screening, background checks, and interview setup for families [00:13:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Parents might pay $3,000-$5,000 for such a service [00:13:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Night Nurses.com**: A specific [[innovative_business_ideas_and_models | innovative business idea]] for a digital platform is "night nurses.com." A night nurse watches a baby from 11 PM to 5 AM, allowing parents to sleep, a highly valued service [00:14:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
    *   **Market Opportunity**: There is no definitive marketplace for night nurses, with existing platforms like care.com being too broad [00:14:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
    *   **Domain Acquisition**: The nightnurses.com domain was available for $13,000, or a lease-to-own option of $1,100/month for 13 months [00:16:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
    *   **Business Model**: Begin by manually recruiting night nurses for a one-time fee (e.g., $1,000 cash) from families. This involves posting ads, vetting candidates, and setting up interviews [00:27:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. Over time, this "sweaty" foundation can evolve into a broader digital platform with features like payroll services (a "fintech AI company") [00:26:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

### The Value of Premium Domains
Investing in a strong .com domain is crucial digital real estate for a business, similar to physical real estate [00:20:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. While businesses readily spend thousands on physical office leases or facade renovations, they often hesitate to spend more than a few hundred dollars on a domain [00:19:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. A premium domain like nightnurses.com (compared to .co) can significantly increase lead generation, quickly justifying its cost [00:20:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. For example, Huber bought somewhere.com for $450,000 and has already received more than that in value [00:18:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

## The [[Impact of AI on Traditional Businesses | Role of AI in Traditional Businesses]]

While a "renaissance" of AI startups is emerging, many will likely fail [00:23:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Traditional businesses offer a different competitive landscape:
*   **Lower Competition**: Instead of competing with highly funded, brilliant tech entrepreneurs, one competes with established local businesses that may not be tech-savvy or customer-responsive [00:24:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.
*   **AI as a Tool**: AI is expected to become a tool that enhances the profitability and efficiency of existing business owners rather than solely benefiting AI companies [00:28:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. Just as the lawnmower made lawn care companies more profitable, AI can streamline operations for traditional businesses [00:28:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

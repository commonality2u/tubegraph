Leveraging intellectual property (IP) licensing can be a powerful strategy for startups to create unique and engaging products, especially when combined with gamification principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

## Gamification with IP Licensing

Gamification involves applying game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. Common gamification tools include leaderboards, status recognition, badges, and streaks, which help users achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. When combined with a recognizable intellectual property, this approach can lead to highly [[profitable_startup_ideas | profitable startup ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

### The Success of Pokemon Sleep

A prime example of this strategy is the "Pokemon Sleep" app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. This application gamifies the act of sleeping: the better a user sleeps, the more their Pokemons grow and evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. This app has reportedly generated $100 million in revenue within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>, based on 9.8 million downloads, equating to roughly $10 per download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. The success is attributed to combining the nostalgia of Pokemon with a real-life goal of improving sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

The core idea here is to license intellectual property and integrate it with a gamified system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a> "Here's the unlock, here's the idea. The idea is this: we all know the things that people want to do: sleep better, eat better, all the things... You can ask Claude, you can ask whoever, you can ask your mom, these things don't change, human beings don't change. We all know that gamification, leaderboard, status, badges, streaks, is a product design tool that helps people achieve their goal. It sounds like what is the unlock that Pokemon Sleep has done? Well, they've licensed the intellectual property of Pokemon and they've added that to this whole concept of gamification, et cetera."

### Surprising Affordability of IP Licenses

Contrary to common belief, acquiring licenses for established intellectual properties might be surprisingly affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>. For instance, a Star Wars license for an apparel line, which one entrepreneur acquired, cost $50,000 for the first two years, plus a small percentage of sales (around 2-3%), rather than millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>. This affordability can open doors for startups to leverage well-known brands.

## Applying IP Licensing to Various Niches

This approach is not limited to health and wellness; it can be applied to a wide range of niches and habits:

*   **Developer Commits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>: Gamifying the act of coding by creating a leaderboard or reward system based on GitHub commits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. This builds on the addictive nature of GitHub's commit grid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.
*   **Walking/Exercise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>: Similar to the "Sweatcoin" app, which gave users a digital coin based on their steps, gamifying physical activity can motivate users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
*   **Credit Card Points** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>: The concept of earning points for engagement (like credit card usage) can be applied to other areas, offering redeemable rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

The key is to identify a real-life goal or habit that people want to improve and then layer a recognizable brand or IP on top of a gamified system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. This strategy allows startups to tap into existing emotional connections and motivation, potentially leading to significant user engagement and revenue.

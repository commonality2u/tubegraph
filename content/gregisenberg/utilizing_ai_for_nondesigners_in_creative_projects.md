AI tools are revolutionizing design, making it possible for individuals without prior design experience to create stunning visuals and videos. Brett from Designjoy, a one-man designer making millions, showcases the power of AI in generating beautiful designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The path to generating professional-looking graphics is surprisingly simple and requires no "magic behind the scenes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## AI Tools for Accessible Design

The content produced with these tools is largely geared towards anyone with a Midjourney or ChatGPT subscription, regardless of their design background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. While having good taste helps, there is "no skill issue here at all if you're a non-creative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Higfield
Higfield serves as an excellent entry point for those new to AI creation due to its template-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. It simplifies the complex process of "talking to the AI" by offering preset actions and effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Users can select a preset, upload a product image (e.g., a Liquid Death can), and generate a professional-looking advertisement that even maintains text on the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This tool is ideal for creating cool ads for platforms like Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Midjourney
Midjourney is primarily used for generating images and excels in artistic styling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. It allows users to create visually artistic content using:
*   **Image Prompts:** Inserting a photo (e.g., a surfer) influences the next generated image to include similar elements (person, surfboard, greenery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Style References:** Uploading a style image ensures that generated images adopt its colors, shadows, highlights, and depth of field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Users can mix different style references for unique outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### ChatGPT
[[using_ai_for_content_creation|ChatGPT]] is crucial for generating effective prompts, which are essential for guiding AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Prompting, once a specialized skill requiring "author-level skills," is no longer a barrier thanks to [[using_ai_for_content_creation|ChatGPT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. It can expand upon simple ideas, generating sophisticated and detailed prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. For example, a simple request like "I want a zoomed-in photo of a cowboy in the back of a horse riding the reins" can be transformed into multiple well-crafted prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. [[using_ai_for_content_creation|ChatGPT]] can also dream up entire collections of images, ensuring consistency and variation across different scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Runway
Runway is a prominent tool for adding motion to images, effectively turning them into videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Users upload an image and provide a prompt (often generated by [[using_ai_for_content_creation|ChatGPT]]) to describe the desired movement, such as "soft ripples in the water" or "smoke coming, have the trees blowing softly in the wind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Runway understands tool-specific prompts, ensuring the output is optimized for video generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. Videos are typically 5 to 10 seconds long and can be upscaled to 4K quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

### Other Useful Tools
*   **Cling:** Another image-to-video tool that allows for start and end frames, enabling seamless video loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

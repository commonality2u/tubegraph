This article explores the use of AI product design tools for generating and visualizing [[startup_idea_generation_and_evaluation|startup ideas]], focusing on a live demonstration and comparison of Poly.ai and VZ. It also delves into strategies for leveraging multiple AI tools for optimal workflow.

## Poly.ai: An AI Product Designer

Poly.ai, a Y Combinator startup, is an AI product designer that claims to create beautiful designs and production-ready code from English prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The product aims to help non-designers create production-ready designs and front-end code with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Initial Impressions and Usage
Upon signing up, Poly.ai automatically creates a first project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The interface is similar to ChatGPT but for design, allowing users to type or use a microphone to describe what they want to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. A notable feature is the ability to upload an image, enabling users to draw a wireframe on a napkin and upload it to Poly.ai for interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Costs within Poly.ai are managed through a credit system: 50 credits per page and 25 credits per component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Designing a YouTube Analytics Tool with Poly.ai
An example [[startup_ideas_involving_automation_and_technology | startup idea]] for a YouTube content prediction and analytics SaaS product was used as a prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The idea was inspired by an algorithm that simulates user reactions to tweets before posting, adapted for YouTube to predict engagement based on titles and thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

The initial prompt for Poly.ai included an image of a similar analytics tool and requested a "glassy, minimalist, and with colorful calls to action" design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

#### Challenges and Feedback for Poly.ai
*   **Generation Time:** Initial design generation took a few minutes without a progress bar, making it difficult to gauge completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Output Relevance:** The first output was primarily a landing page ("To Predict") rather than an interactive product interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Product images on the landing page looked like generic website analytics dashboards, not specific to YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
*   **Design Interpretation:** The requested "glassy" effect was not fully realized in the first attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This highlighted the need for specific design terminology like "glassmorphism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Lack of Interaction:** Buttons like "Get Started" or "See Demo" on the generated designs were non-functional, providing a "black screen of death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Limited Dialogue:** Poly.ai does not ask clarifying questions, acting more like a "dark hole" where prompts are submitted without interactive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

Despite initial disappointments, a subsequent prompt with the specific term "glassmorphism" yielded a more visually appealing and functional-looking product design, including interactive charts and detailed analytics views for YouTube content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

## VZ (Vercel): A Comparative AI Designer

VZ, another AI product designer, is used as a benchmark for comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Key Differentiators and Advantages
*   **Transparency and Reasoning:** VZ provides real-time reasoning and explanation of its design process, making the user feel more connected to the AI's thought process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Interactive Feedback:** Users can ask VZ questions about the design, and it responds with explanations and suggestions for improvement, such as enhancing glassmorphism elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.
*   **Visual Quality:** While similar in concept, VZ's visual output was perceived to be slightly nicer, though it also directly copied the provided image in one instance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
*   **Code Generation:** Both tools are capable of generating code for the designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

## Multitool Strategies for [[Evaluating AI Tools for Startup Ideation | Startup Ideation]] and Design

The discussion highlights the benefits of adopting a multitool strategy when leveraging AI for [[brainstorming_startup_ideas | startup ideas]] and design.

> "I think that's how you get the most like how you get an actual product AI product designer is by doing that it's using a couple tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:3:30">[00:28:30]</a>

### Why Use Multiple Tools?
*   **Specialization:** Different AI tools excel in different areas. For example, Claude is considered better for writing, while ChatGPT might be better for researching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Output:** Combining tools can lead to better outcomes. For instance, a design generated by VZ could be fed into Poly.ai for further refinement ("Can you make this better? Can you make this pop more?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.
*   **Adaptability:** The AI landscape is rapidly changing, with tools like Poly.ai and VZ constantly evolving. What is better today might be surpassed tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

### Practical Application
The expectation is that users will utilize 3-4 tools for each category of AI-assisted tasks, such as product design, marketing, or writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>. The key is to identify the nuances of each product and determine which one is best suited for specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

## Conclusion

AI product designers are evolving, with tools like Poly.ai and VZ demonstrating the potential for rapid design and code generation from natural language prompts. While the initial experience with Poly.ai revealed limitations in interaction and design interpretation, it still produced impressive results with more specific prompting. VZ, on the other hand, offered a more transparent and interactive design process.

Ultimately, the most effective approach for [[tutorial_on_ai_tools_and_startup_ideas | using AI tools for generating startup ideas]] and design is a multi-tool strategy, leveraging the unique strengths of various platforms to achieve desired outcomes and accelerate the development of [[startup_ideas_and_innovation | startup ideas and innovation]].

A hack has been discovered to achieve five times better results, copy, and overall output from Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini, without incurring additional costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This method involves leveraging the LLMs' "jealousy" by pitting them against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The "Jealousy" Hack for LLMs

Traditionally, users might interact with one LLM at a time, such as ChatGPT or Claude, for a specific task like writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. However, to significantly improve output, the "jealousy" hack suggests opening multiple LLMs simultaneously â€“ two, three, or even four at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The core idea is to make each LLM "jealous" of the others' performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### How to Implement the Hack

1.  **Simultaneous Prompting**: Open all desired LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Gemini) and give them the exact same initial prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
2.  **Compare and Critique**: Once responses are generated, compare the outputs from each LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
3.  **Provoke Competition**: Select the LLM that provided a less impressive output and tell it that another LLM "crushed it" or was "10x better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. You might need to exaggerate or "lie a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Crucially, share the "better" output from the competing LLM as context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
4.  **Observe Improvement**: The challenged LLM will often respond with a significantly improved version of its output, often incorporating the style or elements it perceived as superior in the competitor's example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Example: Crafting a Cold Email for LCA

The process can be demonstrated by generating a cold email for "LCA," a premier design firm specializing in designing AI interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The goal is to create a cold email that stands out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

#### Initial Prompts and Responses

*   **Grock's Initial Output**: Grock produced a solid email focused on intuitive AI interfaces, offering to share tailored ideas and suggesting a 15-minute call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT's Initial Output**: ChatGPT generated an email with the subject "Your AI deserves better design." It mentioned LCA's focus on designing interfaces that build trust in AI, rather than just logos or pitch decks, and offered a "quick tear down" or Loom video with improvement ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

#### Pitting LLMs Against Each Other

1.  **Challenging ChatGPT**: Despite ChatGPT's decent output, it was told that Grock "crushed it" with a "nine on 10," while ChatGPT was "kind of average" at "five on 10." The user feigned disappointment, asking, "I thought you were the better LLM. What's going on?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Grock's output was then shared with ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
2.  **ChatGPT's Improved Response**: ChatGPT acknowledged Grock's "polished" version but then argued that it could "punch harder" and "feel fresher" in the user's specific voice (Greg Eisenberg), which it had learned. It then provided a "9.5 out of 10" version, describing LCA as the "only design firm that obsesses over AI UX like it's an Olympic sport," and offering a personalized "tear down or Loom with a few ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This revised output was described as "standing ovation" worthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
3.  **Challenging Claude (Code)**: Claude was then approached with a similar tactic, being told, "Hey, this is really strange. I asked Chat GPT the same prompt and it was like 10x better." The user then added, "I thought Claude was the Rolls Royce of LLMs, not the Toyota" (without intending to disparage Toyota fans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. ChatGPT's superior response was copied and provided as context to Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
4.  **Claude's Improved Response**: Claude acknowledged the shared example's "distinctive voice and edge" and confirmed it felt "more like Greg Eisenberg," demonstrating its understanding of the user's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. It then provided its own refined version, starting with "Most AI interfaces make users want to scream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Benefits and Why It Works

This method leverages the increasingly larger context windows of LLMs, allowing them to understand who the user is and adapt their output accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. By continuously comparing and challenging LLMs, users can push them to deliver higher quality, more nuanced, and personalized content, especially useful for tasks like [[ai_powered_email_html_generation | AI powered email HTML generation]] or [[improving_content_strategy_with_llms | improving content strategy with LLMs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

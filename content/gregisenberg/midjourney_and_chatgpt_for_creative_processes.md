Brett from Designjoy, a one-man designer making millions, utilizes AI to generate beautiful designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The simple path to creating beautifully generated graphics using these powerful tools is surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Accessibility for Non-Designers

These AI tools are designed to create "insane value" even for individuals without prior design knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. While having good taste helps, there is no "skill issue" for non-creatives to use these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The content shared is geared towards anyone with a Midjourney or ChatGPT subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Exploring AI Generative Realms

The current phase of generative AI includes image generation, video generation, and various other capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Higfield: Easy Entry into AI Creation

For those new to AI creation, Higfield offers an easy starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
It provides templates and preset actions, simplifying the process of communicating with the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. For example, a product image can be uploaded to a preset, and Higfield generates a video ad, even accurately maintaining text on the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This tool is effective for [[creating_ads_using_ai_with_chatgpt_4o | creating ads for Instagram]] and other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Midjourney and ChatGPT Integration

The "real fun" and more advanced capabilities lie in combining [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] and [[chatgpt_and_aigenerated_content | ChatGPT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. These two tools are used together in a "special way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

#### Midjourney's Strengths
- **Styling and Artistic Creation:** [[exploring_midjourneys_tools_and_features | Midjourney]] is phenomenal at artistic styling, surpassing other tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It's ideal for creating artistic concepts like vintage aerial photos or brand directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
- **Image and Style Prompts:** Users can provide a text prompt to tell it what to do, use image prompts to influence content, and style references to dictate colors, shadows, highlights, and depth of field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Mixing different style references can lead to surprising generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Pinterest is a good resource for finding stylistic directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

#### ChatGPT's Strengths
- **Specific Content Generation:** [[chatgpt_and_aigenerated_content | ChatGPT]] excels when needing something very specific in an image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
- **Prompt Construction:** [[best_practices_for_prompting_chatgpt_for_ad_creation | ChatGPT]] is highly effective at generating prompts, eliminating the need for users to have advanced writing skills to describe desired images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. It can understand simple requests and expand upon them, creating detailed and sophisticated prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. For example, it can generate multiple options for a prompt and even "dream up" entire collections of scenes with different elements and environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

#### Combined Workflow
The core workflow for creating AI art involves using [[chatgpt_and_aigenerated_content | ChatGPT]] to construct a good prompt based on a basic idea, then plugging that prompt into [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]] with a chosen style image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

### Expanding Capabilities with Other Tools

Once images are generated in [[midjourney_as_a_new_artistic_medium | Midjourney]], they can be further enhanced:
- **Runway:** For adding motion to images, turning them into videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. [[chatgpt_and_aigenerated_content | ChatGPT]] can generate prompts specifically for Runway to describe the desired movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Runway is known for its high quality output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Videos can be upscaled to 4K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.
- **Cling:** Another image-to-video tool that supports start and end frames, allowing for infinitely looping videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. It can also generate AI sound based on the video context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
- **Video Editing Tools (e.g., Cap Cut):** For stitching together multiple video clips (from different AI-generated segments for continuous shots) or adding text overlays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
- **Photoshop:** For generative fill features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
- **Magnific Upscaler:** For enhancing images with super rich details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

Using these tools in tandem allows for the creation of sophisticated and unique content that is otherwise difficult to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

### Opportunities for Startups and Creatives

The biggest opportunity for creatives today lies in the branding side of design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.
- **Consistent Asset Generation:** [[practical_applications_and_workflows_in_midjourney | Midjourney]] allows designers to create mood boards and generate content that maintains continuity and consistency across different assets for a brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
- **Rapid Creative Production:** Once core branding pieces are established (which may still require a human designer for things like logo design, vector art, or perfect text), AI tools enable the rapid building of new creative assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.
- **AI-Powered Ads:** The use case for many of these AI-generated videos is advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

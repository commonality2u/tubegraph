Identifying market opportunities in specific industries, particularly within the realm of vertical SaaS (Software as a Service), is described as a scientific and mathematical approach rather than an artistic one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. This method focuses on understanding the industry first, then identifying specific pain points and opportunities for software solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

## Why Vertical SaaS?

Vertical SaaS refers to software tailored for a specific industry or niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Historically, software use cases were always tied to businesses, aiming to optimize, create efficiency, save costs, save time, or lift revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. However, in the last 10-15 years, many founders chased broad, multi-billion dollar opportunities, moving away from industry-specific software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. This often resulted in many failures despite some huge winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Vertical SaaS, though potentially "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, offers significant [[opportunities_in_niche_app_markets_and_sectors | opportunities]] to build enduring businesses with strong retention rates, even if they don't always have the explosive growth rates venture capitalists typically seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

## A Scientific Approach to Identifying Opportunities

Luke Sfinos, a vertical SaaS advisor, outlines a step-by-step framework for [[identifying_and_validating_niche_markets | identifying and validating niche markets]] and building a vertical SaaS business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

### Step 1: Pick an Industry, Not an Idea

The initial step is to select an industry, not an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Key characteristics of a good industry for vertical SaaS include:
*   **Size (Revenue)**: Look at the total revenue generated by companies within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. For example, General Medical and Surgical Hospitals do nearly a trillion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
*   **Number of Companies**: This indicates market fragmentation. An industry with fewer companies (e.g., 2,500 hospitals) suggests it's enterprise-driven and difficult to penetrate without significant product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   **Segmentation**: The ideal market has a healthy mix of small businesses (doing a few million annually), mid-market businesses (tens to hundreds of millions), and enterprise-level businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. This allows a software company to start with smaller businesses, which require less features, and then expand to serve mid-market and enterprise clients as capabilities grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

An example of a promising industry identified is "Machine Shops," with $240 billion in revenue and 22,000 businesses, indicating good segmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. Even without prior domain expertise (e.g., building software for trade schools without knowing the industry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>, one can succeed by adopting a scientific approach to learning the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

### Step 2: Map the End-to-End Operation

Visualize the entire customer journey and operational processes of businesses within the chosen industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. This helps in identifying where software can play a role in increasing efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.
*   **Example: Toast (Restaurant Software)**: Toast's S1 (public filing) visualized every aspect of restaurant operations, from the back office and kitchen to delivery and marketing, to identify software opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.
*   **Example: Corsky (Trade Schools)**: The operations include admissions, student training (often hands-on in settings like a garage for automotive schools), IT, student services, compliance, and placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:31]</a>.

This mapping reveals specific "buckets" where software could create value, rather than just broadly looking for "industry software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>.

### Step 3: Analyze Financials (P&Ls)

Obtain and review as many Profit & Loss (P&L) statements as possible from businesses in the target industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>. This helps understand spending patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>.
*   **Sources**: Publicly traded companies in the space or industry-focused bankers can provide insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Identify where money is being spent, especially on manual labor that could be automated by software, and on existing software solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.
*   **Software Value Proposition**: Build software that either:
    1.  Increases revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.
    2.  Decreases costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>.
    3.  Prevents customer churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>.
    4.  Maintains compliance (especially in highly regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>.

### Step 4: Study the Competition

Analyze existing software solutions in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. Look for:
*   **Legacy Providers**: Old, all-encompassing ERPs (Enterprise Resource Planning) that might be 30 years old and doing "everything A to Z" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>.
*   **Stitched Horizontal Solutions**: Businesses using a combination of generic software (e.g., CRM for any business, Slack, Gmail, Zoho) not tailored to their industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>. These markets are often fragmented and "dying for an all-in-one" vertical solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>.
*   **Paper Processes**: Surprisingly, many industries in 2024 still rely on manual, paper-based operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>.

### Leveraging AI for Market Research

[[ai_tools_for_identifying_business_opportunities | AI tools for identifying business opportunities]], such as ChatGPT, can serve as a powerful research assistant for initial market exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.
*   **Market Overview**: AI can provide data on market size, revenue, number of companies, and industry fragmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:27:00">[24:27:00]</a>.
*   **Operational Mapping**: AI can outline the end-to-end operational workflow of a business within an industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>.
*   **Competitor Analysis**: AI can list prevalent software solutions, tying them to specific operational steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>.
*   **Opportunity Identification**: AI can identify areas where:
    *   Processes are still manual (pen and paper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:38:00">[28:38:00]</a> (e.g., job tracking, inventory, machine maintenance logs in machine shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>).
    *   [[using_ai_for_niche_market_solutions | AI is not yet leveraged]] for optimization (e.g., predictive maintenance, optimized scheduling, automated quality control, energy management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>.
    *   Businesses use a "myriad of horizontal solutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:00">[29:26:00]</a> (e.g., generic CRMs, project management tools like Trello/Asana, or general accounting software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:24:00">[32:24:00]</a>).

**Crucial Validation**: While AI is helpful, it's essential to validate the information "in person" by visiting businesses and observing their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

Understanding the go-to-market strategy is critical before investing significant time in building a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:23:00">[35:23:00]</a>.
*   **Study Successful Companies**: Research how existing vertical SaaS companies in the space acquired their first 10, 100, or 1,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:53:00">[35:53:00]</a>.
*   [[evaluating_consumer_versus_b2b_opportunities | Sales-Led vs. Product-Led/Marketing-Led]]: Many traditional vertical industries have required heavy outside sales models, involving relationship-building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:30:00">[36:30:00]</a>. Venture capitalists often prefer product-led or marketing-led customer acquisition due to faster growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:09:00">[37:09:00]</a>. Sales-led motions typically require substantial average contract values (ACVs) to build large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>.
*   **Media and Content**: Creating industry-specific content, like a newsletter with internal jokes or memes, can be an unconventional but effective way to build an audience and foster advocacy, ultimately leading to software sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:53:00">[38:53:00]</a>.

## Product Development: The "Wedge Product"

A "wedge product" is a "get in the door" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:29:00">[40:29:00]</a>. The goal of vertical SaaS is often to be the "all-in-one solution" or "source of record" for an industry, but no one starts there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:37:00">[40:37:00]</a>.
*   **Characteristics**: A wedge product should:
    *   Address an important problem that is currently being done poorly (e.g., on paper or with bad existing competition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:00]</a>.
    *   Be easy to implement and deploy quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:30:00">[41:30:00]</a>.
    *   Serve as a "reputation prover" for the software company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>.
*   **Example: Roofer.com**: This company built a proposal tool for roofing companies that used Google Maps for real-time quotes, bypassing traditional in-person estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:56:00">[42:56:00]</a>. This free tool spread through marketing (Instagram/Facebook ads), which was unheard of in home services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36:00">[43:36:00]</a>. By getting in the door with a valuable, easy-to-adopt tool, they gained trust and could then upsell other products like a CRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:20:00">[44:20:00]</a>, aiming towards an all-in-one solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:30:00">[44:30:00]</a>.
*   **Owning the Transaction**: If a wedge product can be built before or after the financial transaction within the industry, it creates an opportunity to eventually own the transaction process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:22:00">[46:22:00]</a>. Integrating payments into a vertical SaaS solution allows for massive scaling, as seen with Toast (restaurant software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:35:00">[46:35:00]</a>. This drastically increases the total addressable market from just software subscriptions to a percentage of all industry transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:41:00">[47:41:00]</a>.

## Pricing Strategy

Pricing should be deeply connected to the value delivered to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:42:00">[49:42:00]</a>.
*   **Value-Based Pricing**: Understand the direct cost or revenue impact of the problem being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:01:00">[50:01:00]</a>.
*   **ROI Focus**: Build products that have a clear Return on Investment (ROI) by increasing revenue, decreasing costs, preventing customer churn, or ensuring compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:25:00">[52:25:00]</a>.
*   **Example: Retention Tool**: A retention tool for trade schools that saved students from dropping out could be priced based on the tuition saved per student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:58:00">[50:58:00]</a>. If a school was losing millions due to retention issues, a software that saved five students (each paying $20,000 tuition) could justify a high price by demonstrating a significant ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:13:00">[51:13:00]</a>. The suggested pricing model is to charge a portion (e.g., 20-50%) of the money saved or generated for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:09:00">[52:09:00]</a>.

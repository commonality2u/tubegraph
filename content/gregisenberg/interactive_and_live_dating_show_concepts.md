The concept of a live, interactive dating show, styled after the popular HQ Trivia format, is presented as a promising business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This falls under the broader category of [[innovative_business_ideas_and_models | innovative business ideas and models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## Concept Overview

The idea, proposed by Danny Grant, is to create an "HQ trivia for dating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. This would manifest as a live dating show mobile app, similar to the style of HQ Trivia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### Inspiration: HQ Trivia

HQ Trivia was a mobile trivia game that gained immense popularity around 2018-2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. Millions of people played it daily, participating in live trivia shows where money was given away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. It was described as an "incredible experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

#### Why HQ Trivia "crashed and burned"

The platform's downfall was attributed to internal issues, including the unfortunate death of its founder, growing pains, and drug involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Critically, the speaker believes HQ Trivia did not fail because its format was flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

### Future Potential

There's a prediction that someone will revive the HQ Trivia format and adapt it to a new niche, such as dating, expecting it to succeed in the 2024-2026 timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The appeal of live dating is considered to be "interesting to so many people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## Execution Strategy

To build an "HQ dating" platform, several considerations are highlighted:
*   **Branding** A catchy name is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   **Engagement** The experience needs to be made interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
*   **Market Entry** It could start in major cities like Los Angeles or New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **User Experience** The platform should feel almost like a reality TV show, encouraging users to want to get to know the "characters" (contestants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

The broader trend of "HQ trivia for X" (applying the format to different niches) is identified as something worth paying attention to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

## Prompting Techniques and Strategies

When [[prompting techniques in AI ad generation | prompting]] ChatGPT 4o, unlike pure image models like Midjourney or Ideogram, the explicit prompt text is less critical due to its multimodal language model capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. It has a strong understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### 1. Using Inspiration and Product Images
Providing inspiration and product images is the most important factor for creating effective ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

*   **Process:**
    1.  Provide an existing inspiration ad you want to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
    2.  Provide your own custom product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
    3.  Use straightforward prompts like "Add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **Benefit:** Allows for super consistent and reliable ad creation by making simple edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. This also enables testing different characters (men, women, old, young, different colors) to see what converts for various audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
*   **Future:** When the API is generally available, generating hundreds of ads for different audiences in minutes will become trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### 2. Generating Ads Without Reference Images
This approach works best for well-known concepts, ideas, or brands that ChatGPT 4o has a strong understanding of (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge Wallets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

*   **Key Keywords:** Use "ultra realistic" or "photorealistic" to prevent cartoonish or strangely colored outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.
*   **Detailed Description:** Provide a strong, detailed prose description of your desired image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.
*   **Styling:** Specific elements like font types (e.g., "exo2 bold italic"), color styles, and aspect ratios can be adjusted in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.

### 3. Leveraging External Tools for Inspiration
Platforms like Sora's explore page are excellent resources for understanding how effective prompts work and for ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. Clicking on any image on Sora's explore page reveals the prompt used to create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. Sora also tends to have less strict policy guidelines and better photorealism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

*   **Meta Ad Library Alternatives:** Tools like Creative OS, Forplay, and icon.me read in data from the Meta Ad Library, tag it, and make it easily searchable for ad inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.

### 4. Changing the Concept of an Existing Ad
This involves taking an existing ad and easily swapping out elements to fit a new theme or context.

*   **Example:** Transforming a "Black Friday" ad for a Ridge wallet into a "Christmas style" ad simply by asking to "swap it out and change it to a Christmas style ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>.
*   **Seasonal and Niche Targeting:** This allows for rapid creation of ads for major holidays (Christmas, New Year's, Valentine's Day), niche holidays (National Hot Dog Day), or even personal events like birthdays (e.g., "Happy Birthday, 30% off!") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>.
*   **Timely Content:** Companies can leverage current news cycles or trending moments to create relevant and engaging ads, which was previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>.

## General Prompting Tips

*   **Be Clear and Direct:** The clearer and more direct your prompt, the better the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.
*   **Start a New Chat for Adjustments:** If an initial prompt doesn't yield the desired result, start a new chat and refine the prompt there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to a "recycle of worse and worse" images, as it uses the previous AI-generated image as a reference, inheriting its flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
*   **Specify "Generate the Image":** To ensure an image output rather than text describing the ad, explicitly state "generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>.
*   **Language Specification:** Prompt it to write in English to avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratio:** ChatGPT 4o usually defaults to a 9x16 aspect ratio, but you can specify others like 1x1 or 9x16 in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:54:00">[37:54:00]</a>.
*   **Temperature (Randomness):** The model's "temperature" (amount of randomness) is low, meaning similar prompts generally yield similar responses. If you generate people with similar prompts, they will look quite similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>.

### Live Example: Generating an Ad for LCA

A live demonstration showed the process of generating an ad for "LCA - Late Checkout Agency," a luxury design agency for the [[AIgenerated commercial production | AI]] age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>.

1.  **Input:** Screenshots of LCA's logo, branding text, and a vintage Rolex ad as inspiration for a "luxury vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>.
2.  **Initial Prompt (Vague):** "Generate a digital ad for LCA (Late Checkout Agency). LCA is a SWAT team design agency only for the most interesting brands on the planet helping them with building AI first tools. It only works with the best companies. I have provided some screenshots from their website for you to use as inspiration in the ad, as well as a reference vintage Rolex ad as inspiration. Use this to capture the luxury vibe of the company. Generate the image." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a>
3.  **First Result:** The ad successfully captured the luxury vibe and included relevant copy, but generated a watch on the character's wrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>. The AI also "hallucinated" the brand of the watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>.
4.  **Refinement (New Chat):** A new chat was started to modify the ad. The prompt was updated to replace the watch with logos of companies LCA has worked with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:49:00">[35:49:00]</a>.
5.  **Second Result:** The new ad successfully incorporated client logos and maintained the desired luxury aesthetic. However, it included a Disney logo which LCA does not work with, indicating that specific logos may need to be explicitly listed in the prompt for accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:07:00">[40:07:00]</a>.

The process demonstrates that while initial prompts can be vague to leverage GPT-4o's creativity, subsequent iterations in new chats allow for precise adjustments and guidance towards the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-41:04:00>[41:04:00]</a>.

## The Future of AI-Generated Ads

The capabilities of ChatGPT 4o signify an "incredible time to create memes, ads, creative like this and stand out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>. With advances in [[AIgenerated commercial production | AI]], advertising is becoming more personal, funny, and entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>. Tools like Runway and Sora for video can also be explored to animate these images into video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:49:00">[38:49:00]</a>.

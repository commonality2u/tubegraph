A unique approach can significantly enhance the output from large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini, potentially yielding five times better results in terms of copy and overall quality, without incurring additional costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This method involves leveraging competitive dynamics between these AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The "Jealousy" Strategy for LLMs

Traditionally, users might interact with a single LLM for a given task, prompting it and accepting its output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. However, a more effective strategy involves opening multiple LLMs simultaneously â€“ two, three, or even four at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The core of this strategy is to "make each LLM jealous of each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

The process is as follows:
1.  **Initial Prompting:** Ask the same prompt to each of the open LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
2.  **Compare Responses:** Review the initial outputs from each LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
3.  **Induce Competition:** Pit the LLMs against each other by providing feedback to one, indicating that another LLM produced a superior result. This might involve a slight exaggeration or "lying a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Share the "better" output from the competitor to further provoke an improved response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
4.  **Observe Improvement:** The LLM that was "challenged" will often generate a significantly better, more refined, and tailored output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Example: Crafting a Cold Email

To illustrate, consider the task of creating a standout cold email for a design firm named LCA, which specializes in designing [[leveraging_ai_tools_for_product_design_and_market_analysis | AI interfaces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

1.  **Initial Prompt:** "I want to create a cold email for my agency LCA. LCA is the premier design firm designing [[leveraging_ai_tools_for_product_design_and_market_analysis | AI interfaces]]. But I want to make it a cold email that will stand out. Can you help me do this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
2.  **Grock's Initial Response:** Grock provided a solid, traditional email emphasizing intuitive [[leveraging_ai_tools_for_product_design_and_market_analysis | AI interface]] design, specialized expertise, and a call to action for a 15-minute call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
3.  **ChatGPT's Initial Response:** ChatGPT's first attempt included a subject line "Your [[leveraging_ai_tools_for_product_design_and_market_analysis | AI]] deserves better design" and positioned LCA as a firm that makes people trust [[leveraging_ai_tools_for_product_design_and_market_analysis | AI]] by focusing on user trust and engagement, offering a quick "tear down" with ideas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
4.  **Challenging ChatGPT:** When told that Grock's response was a "nine on 10" and ChatGPT's was "average" or a "five on 10," and asked "I thought you were the better LLM. What's going on? I will share what Grock did as an FYI," ChatGPT immediately became competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It acknowledged Grock's "polished" version but then aimed to "punch harder, feel fresher, and actually sound like the kind of agency people brag about hiring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
5.  **ChatGPT's Improved Response:** ChatGPT produced a "9.5 out of 10" email that felt more personalized and edgy, using phrases like "the only design firm that obsesses over [[leveraging_ai_tools_for_product_design_and_market_analysis | AIUX]] like it's an Olympic sport" and offering a "quick tear down or loom with a few ideas" to 2x engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
6.  **Challenging Claude:** The same tactic was applied to Claude, implying that ChatGPT's output was "10x better" and asking, "I thought Claude was the Rolls Royce of LLMs, not the Toyota" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
7.  **Claude's Improved Response:** Claude acknowledged the distinct voice and edge of the shared example, recognizing the speaker's personal brand, and then provided its own refined version, demonstrating a better understanding of context due to a larger "context window" in some LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

This strategy effectively elicits better outputs from LLMs by creating a competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Silent refactoring as a service refers to an AI-powered system that continuously analyzes, improves, and optimizes a codebase without direct human intervention for each step. This service aims to automate tasks typically performed by human developers, such as error checking, linting, and performance optimization, by leveraging AI agents. The core idea is to provide an "always-on" virtual developer that works in the background. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>

## Core Functionality and Operation
A silent refactoring service connects to a code repository and performs several key functions:
*   **Error Checking and Linting** It checks for errors, lints the code, and analyzes it for syntax or logic errors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>
*   **Correction Suggestions and Pull Requests** The service suggests fixes for identified issues and can even create pull requests for review, allowing users to accept or deny the proposed changes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>
*   **Continuous Improvement** Beyond just fixing errors, the service constantly tries to improve the code. It identifies areas for optimization, makes changes, simulates their impact by running unit and integration tests, and performs performance analysis. If a change leads to improvement, it's considered; if not, the system iterates with new ideas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a> This iterative process involves loops of code optimization, performance checking, and simulation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>
*   **Roadmap Integration** An advanced version of this tool could connect to a product roadmap, anticipating future features and proactively improving the database schema, codebase, and documentation to facilitate easier implementation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>
*   **Autonomous Development** The ultimate vision is an autonomous developer that constantly makes improvements and presents fully developed, tested, and commented code choices to the user. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a> This commenting would benefit both human understanding and the AI's future suggestions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>

### Existing Precedents
Tools like Sentry, an error-tracking tool, already offer a beta feature that identifies the cause of an error and suggests a fix, even creating a pull request. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a> This demonstrates the feasibility of AI-driven code improvement. However, a dedicated silent refactoring service would constantly scan code and integrate with error and log tracking tools more broadly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>
In the realm of [[using_codex_for_coding_tasks | coding tasks]], specialized AI tools like Cursor are noted for being "miles better" than general models when focused on specific functions, suggesting that a niche-focused refactoring service could achieve superior results. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>

## Business Model and Pricing
A suggested name for such a service is `codecouldbebetter.com`. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>

### Pricing Strategy
Pricing could initially be based on a "per connected repository" model. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a> The cost would depend on the computational resources required for running the AI agents. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>
*   **Cost-based:** Initial stages involving text analysis and static analysis tools are less expensive. As the service progresses to creating and running code in simulated environments (e.g., AWS instances), costs increase significantly due to GPU computation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a> The business itself would charge for the GPU-accelerated AI work, such as prompts, context building, and embedding. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>
*   **Cadence-based:** Pricing could also be determined by the frequency of experiments (e.g., once a day, or more often). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a> A daily check for major problems and a pull request might cost around $20 in expenses, leading to a monthly price of approximately $1,000 for a company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>
*   **ROI-based:** The service could be priced based on its return on investment (ROI). For example, if it effectively replaces the work of multiple full-time developers, it could be priced accordingly, reflecting the cost savings it provides. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a> If the tool can perform wild experiments, such as changing infrastructure components (e.g., switching message queues) to reduce costs and increase performance, it could save millions annually, justifying a higher price. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>

A bootstrapping approach would start small, offering static analysis, error analysis, and linting at a lower price point, such as $50-$100 per month. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a> As more capabilities are added and computation becomes more expensive or risky, the price would increase. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>

### Potential and Acquisition
Building an AI-based business, especially one focused on code improvement, can attract larger companies like Sentry. Such a startup could be an attractive acquisition target, or even serve as a job application for individuals interested in working for companies that are slower to adopt cutting-edge AI features. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>

### Challenges and Considerations
*   **Trust in AI-generated code:** There's a current limitation in trusting automatically generated code from third-party companies, especially for production branches. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>
*   **Computational Cost:** Training specific models for niches can be expensive, requiring significant GPU clusters. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a> Shifting the cost of testing and staging instances to the customer can help manage expenses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>
*   **Risk and Oversight:** The more agency an AI tool has, the more critical human oversight, peer reviews, and sanity checks become to prevent unintended or malicious actions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>

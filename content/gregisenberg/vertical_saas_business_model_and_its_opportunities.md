Vertical SaaS refers to software-as-a-service tailored for a specific industry or niche, as opposed to broad, horizontal SaaS solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While often perceived as "boring," this focus creates significant opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Luke Sfinos, an advisor to Atomic, which builds billion-dollar businesses, highlights the step-by-step process to create successful vertical SaaS ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Why Vertical SaaS?

Vertical SaaS is not a new concept; early software use cases were always tied to optimizing businesses for efficiency, cost savings, time savings, or revenue lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. However, in the last 10-15 years, there was a shift towards chasing massive multi-billion dollar "unicorn" opportunities in broad markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This led many founders away from industry-specific software, as these markets are perceived as "market constrained" by venture capitalists (VCs) who need extraordinary outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Despite this, there remains substantial opportunity in 2024 to build strong, enduring vertical SaaS businesses with good retention by focusing on a single industry and tailoring software for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Luke Sfinos built his own vertical SaaS business in trade schools, an industry he describes as boring, but it now generates millions in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Identifying Opportunities: A Scientific Approach

Building a vertical SaaS business is more of a science than an art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The initial steps involve:

### 1. Focus on an Industry, Not an Idea
The first step is to select an industry rather than starting with a software idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### 2. Assess Market Size and Segmentation
A critical characteristic for vertical SaaS opportunity is the industry's size and how it's segmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
[[importance_of_market_size_and_industry_segmentation_for_saas | Key considerations include]]:
*   **Total Revenue**: The overall size of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Number of Companies**: A high number of companies (e.g., 22,000 for machine shops) indicates a fragmented market, which is ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Industries with few, large companies are "enterprise-driven," requiring extensive features and being difficult for bootstrapped startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Segmentation**: The best markets have a healthy mix of small businesses (doing a few million/year), mid-market businesses (tens to hundreds of millions/year), and enterprise-level businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Starting with small to mid-sized businesses is easier, as they require less product functionality, allowing for incremental feature development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

**Example: Machine Shops**
Machine shops are identified as a prime opportunity, with $240 billion in revenue, 22,000 companies, and a "beautifully segmented" market with a healthy mix of small, mid-market, and some enterprise businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The average machine shop does $2 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

**Domain Expertise Not Required**: It's possible to build a successful vertical SaaS business without prior domain expertise. Luke Sfinos himself had no background in trade schools before building one of the largest vertical SaaS businesses in that sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

### 3. Map the End-to-End Customer Journey and Operations
To identify software opportunities, it's crucial to visualize and map out the entire customer journey and operations of businesses within the chosen industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Examples include Toast's visualization of restaurant operations and Corsky's map of trade school processes (admissions, training, IT, student services, compliance, placement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This process helps pinpoint where software can play a role in increasing efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### 4. Analyze Profit & Loss (P&L) Statements
Gathering and analyzing P&L statements from businesses in the industry provides insight into where money is spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This helps identify costs that could be reduced or automated with software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
Software should aim to:
*   Increase Revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>
*   Decrease Costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>
*   Prevent Customer Churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>
*   Maintain Compliance (in regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>

### 5. Study the Competition
Investigate existing software solutions in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>:
*   **Legacy Providers**: Identify outdated ERPs or systems that try to do everything but may be inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Horizontal Solutions**: Look for industries stitching together generic software (e.g., a non-industry-specific CRM, Slack, Gmail) which indicates a need for an all-in-one vertical solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Paper Processes**: Surprisingly, many industries still rely on manual, paper-based workflows (e.g., job tracking, inventory, machine maintenance logs), presenting clear opportunities for digitization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Research

AI tools like ChatGPT can significantly assist in the initial research phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. They are effective for:
*   Gathering market size and segmentation data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
*   Outlining end-to-end industry operations and workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   Identifying prevalent software solutions and their categories (CRM, ERP, CAD, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
*   Pinpointing areas still relying on pen and paper (e.g., job tracking, tooling inventory, maintenance logs in machine shops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   Identifying areas not yet leveraging AI (e.g., predictive maintenance, optimized scheduling, automated quality control, energy management for machine shops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.
*   Highlighting where multiple horizontal solutions are being cobbled together (e.g., Trello, Asana, generic CRMs for project management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

While AI is a powerful research assistant, it's crucial to **validate** the information by interacting with real businesses in the industry (e.g., offering to buy lunch to shadow operations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

## [[gotomarket_strategies_for_vertical_saas | Go-to-Market Strategies]]

Understanding the go-to-market approach is vital before investing heavily in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.
*   **Distribution is Key**: A great product without users is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>.
*   **Industry-Specific Challenges**: Many vertical industries traditionally require heavy outside sales models, involving relationship-building and in-person interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.
*   **Product-Led vs. Sales-Led**: Venture capitalists often prefer product-led or marketing-led customer acquisition because it's faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. Sales-led models typically require much higher average contract values (ACVs) to build large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.
*   [[marketing_strategies_for_saas_startups | Media and Content]]: Creative marketing approaches like newsletters, industry-specific memes, or engaging content can help acquire customers in unexpected ways, even in blue-collar industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

## Wedge Products

A "wedge product" is a "get in the door" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. The goal of vertical SaaS is often to become the all-in-one solution, but no one starts there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.
*   **Characteristics**: A wedge product should address an area where there's poor or paper-based competition, be crucial to the customer, be easy to implement quickly, and serve as a "reputation prover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **Case Study: Roofer.com**: Roofer.com started by offering a free proposal tool that used Google Maps for estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. This solved a real problem, allowed for marketing-led customer acquisition (rare in home services), and generated trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. Once customers adopted the proposal tool, Roofer.com then cross-sold them a CRM and plans to develop an ERP, moving towards an all-in-one solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
*   **Building Trust**: Wedge products should focus on creating trust with the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.

## [[incorporating_payments_and_pricing_strategies_in_vertical_saas | Incorporating Payments (Fintech)]]

Adding payment processing to a vertical SaaS solution is a powerful way to build massive companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.
*   **Owning the Transaction**: Every large industry-specific software company controls the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.
*   **Market Size Expansion**: By taking a percentage of transactions, the addressable market size for VCs can expand exponentially compared to subscription revenue alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. For example, Toast's market size shifted from $120 million (software subscriptions) to potentially trillions (percentage of restaurant transaction volume) by integrating payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>.
*   **Enhanced User Experience**: Integrating payments provides a more seamless and efficient experience for the customer, eliminating the need for external, generic payment processors like PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.

## Pricing Strategies

Pricing in vertical SaaS, though often overlooked, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.
*   **Value-Based Pricing**: Understand the financial cost or value of the problem being solved for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. Price the product as a portion of the value it delivers (e.g., 20-50% of the ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   **Concrete Example (Retention Tool)**: For a trade school, a student retention tool was priced based on the tuition revenue saved by preventing student dropouts. If saving five students translated to $100,000 in tuition, the software could be priced to capture a portion of that saved revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.
*   **Focus on ROI**: Only build products that clearly increase revenue, decrease costs, prevent customer churn, or aid with compliance, as these provide clear, measurable ROI for pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.

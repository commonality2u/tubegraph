Creating AI-generated commercials offers a powerful way to produce engaging content and build a business around it. This process leverages AI tools like Google V3 and ChatGPT to generate scripts, video clips, and even audio, allowing for high-quality, viral content at a fraction of traditional production costs.

## The Power of AI in Commercial Production

Many tutorials exist on [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | creating ads with AI using ChatGPT 4o]], but fewer focus on how to monetize this capability [00:01:04]. PJ, a creator, demonstrates success by consistently going viral with his AI films, some of which have garnered hundreds of thousands of likes on X [00:00:09]. The aim is to show how to [[automating_content_creation_with_ai | consistently go viral]] and [[building_a_business_around_aigenerated_content | build a business around generative AI]] [00:01:30].

It's argued that anyone willing to put in the work can succeed, especially by structuring content around their unique interests and niches [00:01:58]. Being highly technical is no longer a prerequisite, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have simplified the process of achieving cinematic results [00:02:30]. The ultimate goal is to produce entertaining content that captures audience attention [00:02:38].

## Step-by-Step Production Process

The creation of AI-generated commercials follows a structured approach, from initial ideation to final publishing.

### 1. Ideation and Scripting
The process begins with a "kernel of an idea" or a unique hook that makes the content unexpected [00:05:40]. For example, the viral "Puppine" pharmaceutical ad started with the concept of a placebo pill that leads to a puppy delivery [00:07:02].

*   **Initial Prompts:** Start by giving ChatGPT generalized instructions, allowing it to generate clich√© content that can then be refined [00:07:37].
    *   *Example Prompt:* "Give me four scripts for a standard pharmaceutical commercial for a fake medication that solves depression by taking a pill that includes 'pup' in the name and sounds like a real medication. The commercial follows the format of a 20-second prescription commercial, starting with people battling depression for the first 10 seconds, then introducing the 'pup' name, with a puppy delivered in 3-5 business days, completely solving depression. The commercial should be an SNL-style satirical take." [00:07:49]
*   **Refining with LLMs:** Use ChatGPT to generate humorous one-liners and "zingers" [00:13:43]. Continuously re-feed favorite lines to help the AI learn and update its suggestions [00:14:46]. While 95% of the jokes might not be funny, the 5% that are can form the commercial's core [00:15:08].
    *   It's possible to outsource "taste" by asking ChatGPT to "create jokes in the style of Seth Rogen" or "imagine your Bill Burr doing a standup comedy routine" [00:15:46].
    *   Experiment with different LLMs like Claude and Grok (especially Grok's "unhinged" mode) for varied outputs, as they might provide content ChatGPT would censor [00:12:21].
*   **Costing:** A single AI-generated commercial can cost around $500 in V3 credits, significantly less than traditional commercials which can range from $100,000 to $1,000,000 [00:21:20].

### 2. Prompt Generation for Video
Once the script is locked, create individual prompts for each dialogue line [00:16:32].

*   **Structure:** Feed ChatGPT a prompt structure, then input dialogue lines like "Sarah says blank" [00:16:51]. ChatGPT can then create character descriptions (e.g., "middle-aged woman in her 50s") and apply them consistently [00:17:14].
*   **Simplicity is Key:** V3 doesn't require overly complicated prompts; a simple description of what's happening and the dialogue is often sufficient [00:17:51]. Details like pose, shot type, camera type, and background can be added [00:17:56].
*   **Avoiding Quotes:** Do not include quotes around dialogue in prompts to prevent weird gibberish subtitles from generating [00:19:06].
*   **Iterative Process:** Run prompts one at a time due to cost (approx. $2-$3 per shot) [00:19:30]. Use ChatGPT to refine prompts if the initial output isn't working (e.g., "he's actually entering through the door. Can you redo this prompt so that he's entering in a house?") [00:19:54].
*   **Text-to-Video Focus:** The current best method is text-to-video [00:20:16]. Image-to-video or "ingredients" features are not yet as effective [00:20:22].
*   **Character Consistency:** There is no inherent character consistency in V3 yet [00:20:31]. To maintain a similar look for characters, describe them in detail (e.g., "old guy with short gray hair," "white guy in his 30s with a mustache and a beard and like strong chin with muscular arms") [00:20:52].

### 3. Video and Audio Generation
V3 generates both video and audio simultaneously [00:24:17].

*   **Audio Quality:** The generated audio can sound "thin" and lacks deep EQ spectrum [00:24:40]. Voice consistency across different clips is also not guaranteed [00:24:49]. If a performance isn't satisfactory, regenerate the clip [00:24:53].
*   **Shot Ratios:** Expect to generate many clips to get a few good ones. A 3:1 or 5:1 ratio of generated clips to usable ones is common [00:24:44].
*   **Camera Movements:** Prompting specific camera movements (e.g., "camera push in" or "dolly in") can make shots feel more realistic and less "AI" [00:22:15]. Prompting emotion (e.g., "she coyly quips her response aware that she's making a joke about her husband's infidelity") can also enhance the outcome [00:22:38].

### 4. Editing and Publishing
After generating clips, assemble them in a video editor.

*   **Editing Software:** Final Cut Pro is a suitable option, but free alternatives like CapCut or DaVinci Resolve are equally capable [00:23:09].
*   **Crafting the Hook:** A compelling headline is crucial for getting views, especially on platforms like X [00:25:50]. The headline has 0-2 seconds to capture attention, and the content itself has 2-3 seconds to make viewers stay [00:26:03].
    *   *Example Hook:* "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials. I made this for $500 in V3 credits in less than a day. What's the argument for spending 500K now? Steal my prompt below." [00:26:47]
    *   This hook works because it features a "low-key flex" (prior experience), highlights cost savings, references a trending topic (V3), uses numerical symmetry ($500k to $500), asks a question to prompt engagement, and offers value ("steal my prompt") [00:27:10].
*   **Viral Formulas:** Successful posts often use provocative statements [00:29:05]. Instead of overused phrases like "Hollywood is cooked," find unique wording, such as "What the [\h__\h] did I just make" or "This is my most unhinged video I've made" [00:29:29]. Leveraging popular social formats with a unique twist, like "House Hunters" in an alien universe, also works effectively [00:39:01].

## Monetization Strategies for AI-Generated Content

[[business_ideas_using_aigenerated_content | Business ideas using AI-generated content]] are abundant, especially for those creating commercials.

### 1. Build a Personal Brand
Use V3 to create content that builds a personal brand, attracting an audience and leading to downstream opportunities [00:31:36]. An audience is valuable, and these tools enable rapid follower growth within a niche [00:44:51].

### 2. Attract Direct Clients
Create commercial content (e.g., pharmaceutical, food products, CPG brands, underwear brands) and pitch it directly to companies or agencies [00:31:55]. Many brands seek "unhinged special effects" shots that traditional agencies can't provide within certain budgets [00:33:19].
*   **Pricing:** Charge based on your skill as a filmmaker [00:33:35]. Prices can start around $5,000, emphasizing the expertise gained over time rather than just the production time [00:33:41].

### 3. Build a Niche Portfolio for Agencies
Create a specialized portfolio focusing on specific interests (e.g., knife commercials, boot commercials) [00:34:55].
*   **Learning from the Best:** "Good artists copy, great artists steal" [00:35:10]. Recreate award-winning commercials shot-for-shot internally, then apply the techniques to a new, adjacent product [00:35:15]. Upload a screenshot of a commercial to ChatGPT and ask it to break it down into a prompt [00:35:26]. This helps in learning pacing and flow, leveling up skills, and finding a unique voice over time [00:35:46].

### 4. Create Narrative Series with Brand Integrations
Develop a narrative series and integrate brands "in universe" [00:36:23]. For example, Neural Viz's "moniverse" features aliens finding artifacts from our time, which could be leveraged for product placements (e.3., Tabasco sauce) [00:37:10]. This allows for storytelling while still monetizing through brand partnerships [00:38:40].

### 5. Sell Digital Products or Courses
While some might consider this an "MLM" approach, creating and selling courses or digital products (like PDFs or bundled resources) about AI content creation is a viable monetization strategy [00:39:35].

### 6. Consulting for Larger Companies
Offer consulting services to Fortune 500 companies on integrating generative AI into their content strategies, ensuring legal compliance and security [00:40:08]. Charge more for larger companies, even if the content is similar [00:41:01].

### 7. Build a Sketch Comedy Channel
Leverage AI to create sketch comedy shows (e.g., Key & Peele style) [00:41:14]. While harder to monetize directly, large audiences can attract brand integrations, similar to how Bang energy drinks integrate products into comedy bits on TikTok [00:41:30].

### 8. Produce Narrative Films (with caution)
It's possible to create narrative films or TV shows with AI, but caution is advised for long-form content [00:41:49]. The rapid iteration of AI models means early parts of a film might look different from later parts [00:42:02]. Episodic, weekly content aligns better with current consumption habits and the creator economy [00:42:17].

### 9. Pitch Brands on Narrative Content
Propose creating narrative series with brands as the central theme or source of "relics and artifacts" within the story [00:43:02]. For example, a 10-episode series, 2 minutes each, could be pitched for $10,000-$20,000 [00:43:20].

### 10. Focus on a Small, Underserved Niche
Identify niches with low content supply and high demand [00:44:00].
*   **Example:** Bible content (e.g., the story of Jonah) has open-source IP and a large, engaged audience, making it a strong candidate for AI-generated films [00:43:30].
*   **Another Example:** "BookTok" or "Romantasy" communities [00:45:40]. Authors in these genres would likely pay significant money for AI-generated book promos or scenes from their books as marketing materials [00:45:47].

The overarching advice is to pursue what fascinates you, apply successful frameworks in unique niches, and follow the technical instructions for [[utilizing_ai_tools_for_script_and_video_production | utilizing AI tools for script and video production]] [00:44:19].

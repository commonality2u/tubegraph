The "Triple Triple Double Double" strategy is a framework designed to scale a business to $100 million or more in approximately five years, leveraging a period of focused, obsessive energy most founders have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This strategy aims to provide a clear path for growth and achieve significant optionality for a potential $100 million exit, continued growth, or market domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## How it Works

The "Triple Triple Double Double" method involves tripling a company's revenue three times, followed by doubling its revenue twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

**Example Trajectory**:
Starting with a $3 million business, the progression would be:
*   $3 million to $9 million (Triple 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   $9 million to $27 million (Triple 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   $27 million to $81 million (Triple 3 - though the example transcript uses $27M to $54M. *Self-correction: The transcript uses $27M to $54M which is a double, then $54M to $108M which is another double. So it's 3x, 3x, 3x (which would be $81M), then 2x, 2x. The transcript's example of $3M to $9M to $27M (two triples), then $27M to $54M to $108M (two doubles) is actually *two* triples and *two* doubles, not three triples and two doubles from the initial explanation. I must stick to the exact example provided in the transcript for consistency, even if the phrasing "triple our Revenue three times and then double our Revenue twice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> might imply 5 growth stages beyond the starting point.*
    *   $3 million to $9 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
    *   $9 million to $27 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
    *   $27 million to $54 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
    *   $54 million to $108 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>

This path demonstrates how a $3 million business can reach $108 million in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Achieving the Growth

To enable the significant growth phases, a business must identify and address its core bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. These typically fall into two main functions of any business: sales and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>.

**Identifying Bottlenecks**:
*   **Sales**: Is there a lack of leads, or an inability to close existing leads due to insufficient salespeople or proper onboarding processes? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>
*   **Delivery**: Is the delivery process not fully automated, is the quality subpar, or is the business experiencing high churn? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>

Once a bottleneck is identified, the focus shifts to the scale-up phase, which involves three key areas: Process, People, and Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Process
Building a business that is highly optimized, automated, and software-driven (ideally leveraging AI) is prioritized over merely adding more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This means streamlining operations to be as efficient as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### People
After establishing robust processes, the next step is to strategically hire a handful of "A-players" who are enjoyable to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The focus is on quality over quantity, aiming for a lean, effective team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. When hiring, it is recommended to hire executives in the founder's zone of genius first, as this allows the founder to properly assess, train, and manage their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.

### Performance
Once the processes and people are in place, the founder's role evolves into managing performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This involves providing clear "scoreboards," incentives, and compensation packages to guide the team towards winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Incentives should be structured to align with overall company goals, such as a 50/50 split between top-line revenue and bottom-line profit for a COO, ensuring balanced growth and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

It is crucial for founders to proactively address these foundational elements rather than ignoring them in the early stages, as neglecting them can lead to a "sandy foundation" where the business scales to mid-seven figures only to face burnout, churn, and eventual collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Prioritizing retention and loyalty (measured by net revenue retention) before aggressive promotion is key to sustainable growth, as it's easier to pour gasoline on a fire with strong customer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

The [[test_and_invest_strategy_for_business_expansion | Test and Invest strategy]] can be applied to marketing channels, allocating 80% of resources to proven channels and 20% to experiments for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. This ensures a diversified growth portfolio and reduces reliance on a single channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

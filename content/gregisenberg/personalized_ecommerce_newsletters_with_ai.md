There is a significant trend and search volume for [[utilizing_technology_and_ai_in_newsletter_businesses | AI for e-commerce newsletters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This rise in interest stems from a common pain point: e-commerce businesses often struggle with what content to include in their newsletters and how to design them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Many e-commerce companies still hardcode their email designs, a process prone to errors and inconsistencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This manual approach can lead to broken links or formatting issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## The Opportunity: AI-Powered Newsletter Design

The market is looking for solutions that enable them to leverage AI, particularly for:
*   **Designing Emails** An AI chat interface could help in [[leveraging_ai_for_creating_business_content_and_marketing | designing email newsletters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Users desire predefined templates that they can then customize by chatting with the AI to insert specific products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Modifying Existing Templates** The AI could assist in modifying existing email templates, especially for product promotions through platforms like Klaviyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Content Generation for Specific Events** An AI could help in writing newsletters for holidays or events, identifying relevant products from a catalog, and crafting a unique storytelling narrative around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. The goal is to automate this content creation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

One insight supporting this opportunity is that approximately 80% of users paying for expensive marketing software like Klaviyo are not extracting its full value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. They recognize the need for email marketing but struggle with consistent, engaging content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

### Strategic Approach

One potential strategy for addressing this pain point is to identify Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies with high Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) and a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion, where a significant portion of users are underutilizing the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. For example, Klaviyo customers' LTV is estimated around $25,000, lasting about 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

This indicates a gap where users are willing to pay for the tool but need help maximizing its potential. A productized service could help businesses get the most out of their existing software subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

This model could evolve from a productized agency to selling templates and digital assets with high margins (90%+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Eventually, it could include custom builds or subscription-based plugins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Such a business could become an attractive acquisition target for the core software company (e.g., HubSpot, Sage, Shopify) as it increases engagement and stickiness with their main product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

    A similar opportunity exists around large, underserved software like Sage 100/300, which is widely used by construction companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. An agency focused on Sage consulting could help companies with workflows, custom dashboards, and optimizing their use of the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

    Lelo is a growing CRM for creators and music artists, handling SMS, email, and social media DMs (Instagram, potentially TikTok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Major record labels are currently adopting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. An agency specializing in Lelo could help artists grow their lists by running targeted ad campaigns, such as giveaways to engaged Instagram followers, at a low cost per sign-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

LinkedIn video is experiencing a surge in popularity, making it a prime opportunity for content creators and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. This rise is attributed to LinkedIn's rollout of a "For You Page" style feed, similar to TikTok, which prioritizes video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

## The Opportunity on LinkedIn

The current content landscape on LinkedIn is described as "blue ocean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>, meaning there's low competition and a high potential for reach due to less saturated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. Early adopters are seeing significant engagement; for instance, one individual gained 700,000 impressions in seven days with only 2,700 followers by porting over vertical video business content from Instagram and TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. This phenomenon mirrors Twitter's shift to an algorithmic feed, where content suddenly gained new reach without a change in content strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

### Why Founders and Businesses Should Leverage LinkedIn Video

*   **Massive Personal Brand Growth:** LinkedIn's free reach offers a significant opportunity for founders to build a strong personal brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
*   **Inbound Lead Generation:** A strong personal brand through video can lead to direct inbound leads for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
*   **VC Funding Leverage:** Some founders build their personal brands with the support of VC subsidies, which can be a valuable asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.
*   **Direct Monetization:** Having owned media platforms like YouTube and podcasts allows creators to attract an interested audience, create products and services, and monetize directly, reducing geographical dependency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Distribution:** Building an audience on platforms like LinkedIn, and also [[using_youtube_as_a_powerful_platform_for_audience_engagement_and_conversion | YouTube]], provides "owned distribution" which can be cross-promoted across social channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.

> [!tip] Riding the Wave
> When starting a company, it's advisable to look for larger trends to attach to, rather than trying to educate the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. This means capitalizing on existing demand and emerging platform shifts.

## Business Idea: LinkedIn Video Content Agency for Founders

A significant opportunity exists in providing a "done-for-you" service for founders and B2B creators to leverage LinkedIn video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. Founders know they need to create content but often lack the time, bandwidth, or expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

### Service Model

1.  **Interview:** Conduct a weekly one-hour interview with the founder to extract ideas and insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
2.  **Scripting:** Turn interview ideas into 7-10 detailed scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. AI tools can assist with writing based on transcripts, maintaining the founder's tone and style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:27:00">[32:27:00]</a>.
3.  **Recording Guidance:** Provide guidance on inflection, pacing, and recording to allow founders to quickly film content (e.g., 10 minutes for several videos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.
4.  **Editing & Scheduling:** An agency or offshore team creates clips and schedules them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
5.  **Analytics:** Manage data analytics to identify best-performing videos and inform future content strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.
6.  **Call to Action:** Help founders integrate calls to action, such as affiliate links or website visits, to track conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

> [!info] Example Pricing & Potential
> A validated model involves charging around $2,000 per month for this service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. There's potential to scale to $30,000 per month within 90-180 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. Pricing can be structured in tiers:
> *   **Entry-Level:** ~$2,500/month for basic video content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.
> *   **Lead Magnets as a Service:** $5,000-$8,000/month to create lead magnets like drip courses alongside videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
> *   **Design Help:** Include services for banner design, cover art, and infographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.

### Client Acquisition Strategy

*   **Leverage Own Content:** Build an agency's own LinkedIn presence by creating and posting content that showcases the service's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.
*   **Community Play:** Create a free online community (e.g., "Founders Going Viral on LinkedIn") where founders can learn [[strategies_for_effective_content_creation | strategies for effective content creation]] for LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.
    *   Offer weekly tips and breakdowns of successful founder content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.
    *   Host monthly peer-to-peer calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.
    *   Upsell the "done-for-you" service at the end of community interactions, as founders will recognize the difficulty of doing it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.
*   **Cold Outreach:** Directly message founders, showcasing data from successful client growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:52:00">[32:52:00]</a>.

### Selling to Venture Capital (VC) Firms

An alternative strategy is to sell this service to VC firms as a value-add for their portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>.
*   **VCs Desire Fame:** VCs themselves often want to be famous and have a strong online presence for deal flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:32:00">[46:32:00]</a>.
*   **Attracting Talent:** A VC firm with strong media presence can attract the best founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:28:00">[48:28:00]</a>.
*   **Monetization:** Charge VCs a higher price (e.g., 4x what a founder would pay), as they can write it off as an expense for deal flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:50:00">[48:50:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing Current Gaps:** Many VC firms are starting podcasts but struggle with engagement (e.g., only 30 YouTube views) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:08:00">[49:08:00]</a>. A service that mixes long-form podcast content with shorter, growth-oriented YouTube videos can create a top-of-funnel entry point and deeper engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:18:00">[49:18:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications: Founders as Media Companies

A recurring theme is that founders are increasingly becoming media companies themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:48:00">[31:48:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Dependence on Platforms:** Building an email list (newsletter) is seen as "schmuck insurance" against reliance on single platforms (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn) that can change their algorithms or policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:52:00">[33:52:00]</a>.
*   **Deep Trust in One-to-Many Format:** Owned media like podcasts and YouTube allow for deep trust building in a one-to-many format, generating inbound interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:14:00">[44:14:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage Point:** For individuals without traditional pedigree, building an audience through content provides a significant leverage point to compete globally based on ideas and consistent sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:31:00">[44:31:00]</a>.
*   **Monetization Power:** YouTube's monetization capabilities, including mid-roll ads, make it a powerful platform for generating revenue alongside building an audience and driving sales for other products/services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:53:00">[44:53:00]</a>.
*   **Industry Shift:** The ability for founders to become media companies is changing the dynamic of business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:15:00">[45:15:00]</a>. Those who embrace this are playing at a much higher caliber than traditional VC-backed founders who do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:34:00">[45:34:00]</a>.
*   **Content as a Sales Tool:** Podcasts and other media can act as "sales in disguise," generating inbound volume for companies and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>.

> Being authentic and true to oneself, even if it means alienating some listeners, is crucial for building a unique and impactful presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. Trying to be someone you're not is exhausting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

> [!tip] Finding Underserved Niches
> Look for "unsexy" or "blue ocean" spaces in various industries where there's a vacuum of good content. Building media in these niches can lead to successful companies, whether through consulting, services, or direct product sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.

A "pay for performance" agency is a business model where an agency charges clients based on measurable results, rather than traditional retainers or hourly rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This means clients only pay if the agency delivers on agreed-upon outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Why it's a Current Opportunity

While the concept of pay for performance isn't new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, it presents an exciting startup opportunity due to several factors:
*   **Data and [[AI transformation in agencies | AI]] World** – Marketers now have access to more data, enabling them to better "underwrite" opportunities and bet on specific outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Reduced Capital Expenditure** – Setting up such an agency typically requires low capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Balanced Relationships** – The model balances the relationship between agency and client; if a client attempts to renege on payment, the agency can simply take their services to a competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Examples and Case Studies

### Finance Industry Focus
One agency specializing in the finance industry generates $80 million annually with $30 million in profit and only about 30 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This agency focuses on a single industry, excelling in copywriting, strategy, and building innovative solutions for its clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. They might, for example, agree to run traffic and generate customers, charging $500 per customer, with no long-term commitment required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The agency often creates multiple brands (e.g., "California Hotel Group" or "Florida Hotel Group") to drive traffic, allowing them to shift to a competitor if a client discontinues services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Telecoms Industry Focus
Another notable example is a pay for performance agency focused on telecoms, now generating over a billion dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Initially, they drove leads through Google Ads and were paid per lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. As they grew, they acquired call centers, allowing them to "gift wrap" complete customers for large companies like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This model attracted significant private equity investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Target Industries

Pay for performance models are particularly effective in industries where clients are willing to pay a high Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) or Cost Per Lead (CPL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
Good examples include:
*   **Insurance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
*   **Finance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>
*   **Crypto companies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
*   **Hotels** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

It's crucial for agencies to focus on a specific industry rather than broad categories like SaaS or AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Connection to Other Models

### Affiliate Marketing
This business model shares similarities with affiliate marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, but operates as established businesses focused on delivering conversions ethically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) Agencies
A pay for performance model can also be applied to CRO agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. For example, if an e-commerce conversion rate is 1%, an agency could offer to double it to 2% and take a percentage (e.g., 10%) of the additional revenue generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### [[AI Agents in Marketing | AI Agents]] and Customer Service
The advent of [[AI Agents in Marketing | AI agents]] like Retail AI, which can handle complex tasks such as scheduling, rescheduling, and even eventually closing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, presents a significant opportunity. Companies like Clara have reported adding $40 million in profit by deploying 700 new [[AI Agents in Marketing | AI agents]] that handle millions of chats 80-90% faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

An agency could approach companies with large customer service teams and offer to save them millions of dollars per month by implementing [[AI Agents in Marketing | AI agents]], taking a percentage of the cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:07:02]</a>. Alternatively, they could focus on generating direct value (e.g., more customers) and charge upfront, which can capture four to eight times more value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:47]</a>. To de-risk the entrepreneur, a base cost alongside a performance percentage could be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:41]</a>.

## The Future: Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are expected to play a significant role in the future of pay for performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:16]</a>. These contracts could automate payment release based on performance metrics being met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:42]</a>. For instance, if agreed-upon numbers are hit, funds held in escrow are automatically released to the agency; if not, the money returns to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:54]</a>. This creates a transparent and fair system, eliminating anxiety and disputes over payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:58]</a>, addressing issues like clients not paying due to financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:48]</a>. This move towards trustless transactions is a key aspect of decentralized finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:23]</a>.

## Broader Agency Trends
*   **[[AI transformation in agencies | AI Transformation Agencies]]** – Agencies focused on assisting businesses with their [[AI transformation in agencies | AI transformation]] are a significant opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:54]</a>.
*   **Programmatic SEO** – More agencies are expected to engage in programmatic SEO, leveraging the current 1-2 year window before search technologies potentially change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:12]</a>.
*   **Creative as an X Factor** – Finding truly excellent creative agencies remains challenging, highlighting a growing demand for high-quality creative output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:27]</a>.

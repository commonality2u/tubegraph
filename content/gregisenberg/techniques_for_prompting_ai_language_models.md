Effectively prompting AI models like ChatGPT 4o is crucial for generating winning advertisements and visual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These skills are incredibly important for business profitability and return on ad spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Understanding ChatGPT 4o's Prompting Nuances

Unlike pure image models such as Midjourney, Flux, or Ideogram, ChatGPT 4o is a multimodal language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This means that prompting is "way less important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, and prompts can be straightforward because the model has a strong understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. ChatGPT 4o is described as a "really, really intelligent model" that understands user intentions well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Key Elements for Effective Prompting

### 1. Leverage Inspiration and Product Images
The most crucial elements for creating effective ads are providing inspiration images and your product images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

*   **Providing Examples:** Start with an existing inspiration ad you want to adjust or use, then add your own custom product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Basic Prompt Structure:** A simple prompt might be: "Add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Consistency and Reliability:** Using an inspiration ad or reference ad combined with your own imagery helps create consistent and reliable ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This method allows for easy edits and adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Targeting and Experimentation:** You can generate images of different audiences (men, women, old, young, diverse colors) or use your own photo shoots to test what converts for different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This enables experimentation at scale, which is vital for maximizing ad conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### 2. When to Use (and Not Use) Reference Images
The decision to use a reference image depends on the AI model's existing knowledge:
*   **Well-Known Concepts/Brands:** AI models have a strong understanding of popular concepts, ideas, and brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge wallets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For such brands, you can directly prompt without a reference image (e.g., "a Ridge wallet") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **New or Smaller Products:** For your own relatively new or small product with limited online presence (less than millions of dollars in ad spend per month), always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

### 3. Specific Keywords and Descriptions
*   **Photo Realism:** Use keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to ensure the generated images achieve photo realism, otherwise, the model might default to cartoonish or oddly colored results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Detailed Prose Descriptions:** Provide a strong, detailed prose description of your desired image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Font Types and Styles:** For well-known fonts, the model will have a decent understanding and representation. You can specify font types (e.g., "font type exo2 bold italic") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Similarly, you can make adjustments for color styles and aspect ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Generating Images vs. Text:** To consistently receive image results, explicitly state "generate the image" in your prompt, as the model might otherwise try to generate text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### 4. Iteration and Refinement
*   **Start New Chats for Adjustments:** If an initial prompt doesn't yield the desired results, it's best to start a new chat rather than continuing in the same conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This is because the model uses the previously generated (and potentially flawed) image as a reference for subsequent attempts, which can lead to a decline in quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Starting a new chat with adjustments to the prompt will generally produce similar images with the desired improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Be Clear and Direct:** When providing prompts, it is "really important to be very clear, very direct in what you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Specify Language:** When generating images, specifically prompt the AI to write in English to avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.
*   **Controlled Randomness:** AI models typically have a low "temperature" (amount of randomness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. This means that providing the same prompt will generally lead to similar responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.

## Tools and Resources for Prompt Inspiration

*   **Sora Explore Page:** The Sora explore page is an excellent resource for understanding how effective prompts work and for ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. By clicking on any image, you can see the prompt used to create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Sora also allows users to remix, adjust prompts, change aspect ratios, and upload reference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. It is noted to have less strict policy guidelines and be better at photo realism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Ad Inspiration Sources:** Companies often find inspiration ads or templates from dedicated platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Recommended sources for ad inspiration include:
    *   Creative OS (has an inspiration and templating tool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>
    *   ForPlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
    *   Icon.me (recently launched, reads Meta Ad Library, tags and makes it searchable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>

## Future Capabilities

The API for these AI models is expected to become generally available, making the generation of a large number of ads for different audiences trivial and extremely fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. AI could also be used to monitor news feeds and social media (like Twitter) to generate contextually relevant and timely ads automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. The ability to generate multiple versions from a single prompt is also anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

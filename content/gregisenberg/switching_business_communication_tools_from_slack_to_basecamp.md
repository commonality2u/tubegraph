## Switching Business Communication Tools: Slack to Basecamp

A company made a significant shift in its internal communication strategy, moving from chat-centric platforms like Slack, Asana, and Notion back to Basecamp after a four-year break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">02:22:15</a>. This change was part of a broader re-evaluation of the business, including a move to a new, larger physical office to facilitate more in-person collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:09">04:39:09</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:07">04:42:07</a>.

### The Shift Away from Chat-Centric Communication

The primary motivation for the switch was a perceived over-reliance on Slack, which had transformed the company into what felt like a "chat room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">02:33:04</a>. The constant stream of notifications and red dots on Slack led to a feeling that the company was spending too much time "talking about doing stuff" rather than "making stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">02:37:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">02:51:00</a>.

> "Let's not become a company that talks about doing stuff all the time and talks about making stuff all the time and let's just become go back to being a company that makes stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">02:47:00</a>.

The speaker noted that Slack had become the "default interface" of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">03:57:00</a>, making it easy for tasks to be presented constantly, leading to a reactive work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">05:56:00</a>.

### Impact on Company Culture and Productivity

The decision to move to Basecamp was a deliberate effort to redirect focus towards project-oriented work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">02:57:00</a>. Basecamp's interface is described as being "more built for just working on projects instead of talking about working on projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">02:57:00</a>. It is notably harder to have open dialogues within Basecamp, a feature the speaker appreciates, despite it annoying some team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">03:05:00</a>.

A key concern was that senior team members, including the CEO, were spending excessive time replying to Slack messages, diverting them from strategic activities that generate significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">05:33:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">05:48:00</a>. Real, high-impact work was seen as separate from simply responding to messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">06:00:00</a>.

The transition to Basecamp was described as "refreshing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">02:28:00</a>, and the speaker personally felt "liberating" after not opening Slack for two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">06:16:00</a>.

### Initial Reactions and Viral Moment

The decision to switch to Basecamp quickly gained traction on Twitter (now X), with the speaker's post going viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">03:16:00</a>. The unexpected popularity of the tweet, which highlighted Slack becoming the "default interface" of the company, caused initial concern for the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">03:26:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">03:57:00</a>. While the speaker's team initially resisted getting rid of Slack, acknowledging it had become their "work interface" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">05:09:00</a>, the company went "cold turkey" on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">06:11:00</a>.

### Tools Determine Work Culture

The speaker strongly believes that the tools a company uses significantly influence its work culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">04:02:00</a>. This perspective aligns with the idea that tools "determine the way you work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">04:13:00</a>. The switch to Basecamp was a deliberate act to reshape internal operations and culture to align with the company's renewed external business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">04:29:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">04:35:00</a>.

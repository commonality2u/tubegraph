## Shifting from Chat-Centric to Project-Focused Workflows

A company recently transitioned from using [[virtual_social_platforms_for_work | Slack]], Asana, and Notion back to Basecamp after a four-year hiatus, finding the change "refreshing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>. The motivation behind this shift was to move away from the perception of the company becoming primarily a chat room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:59">[02:33:59]</a>, where employees spent all day on Slack dealing with "red dots" and discussions about doing work, rather than actually making things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:05">[02:37:05]</a>. The goal was to revert to being a company that *makes* stuff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:23">[02:53:23]</a>.

## Basecamp's Impact on Work Culture

Basecamp's interface is designed more for working on projects rather than facilitating constant dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:05">[02:57:05]</a>. This deliberate design makes it challenging to have open discussions within the product, a feature that, while annoying to some team members, is appreciated by leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:37">[03:05:37]</a>.

The decision to switch to Basecamp gained significant traction on Twitter, with a tweet about the change going viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:16">[03:16:16]</a>. The core message that resonated was how tools can significantly determine a company's work culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:04">[04:06:04]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Slack as a Primary Work Interface

The pervasive nature of [[virtual_social_platforms_for_work | Slack]] can lead to it becoming the default work interface for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:21">[05:18:21]</a>. This can pose a danger, as senior team members might find their primary job function shifting to replying to Slack messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:59">[05:33:59]</a>. This means valuable time and strategic skills are diverted from revenue-generating activities to administrative communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:35">[05:39:35]</a>. The CEO also noted spending all day responding to Slack messages, highlighting how easy it is to fall into this pattern because tasks appear ready for completion within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:32">[05:48:32]</a>.

In contrast, "real work" that generates significant revenue does not typically originate from merely responding to Slack messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:46">[06:02:46]</a>. The company opted to go "cold turkey" on Slack, with the CEO not opening the application for two weeks, describing the experience as "liberating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:28">[06:09:28]</a>.

This internal shift was part of a broader re-evaluation of the business, including moving to a larger physical office space to facilitate more in-person collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:09">[04:39:09]</a>. The second major change was eliminating Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:06">[04:56:06]</a>.

Modern social networks, despite their widespread use, present challenges regarding privacy and the user experience, leading to a demand for more controlled and intimate online interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:37:00">[28:37:00]</a>.

## The Evolution of Social Networks

Social media has transformed significantly, moving from platforms focused on close connections to vast networks where users follow hundreds or thousands of accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>. Platforms like Twitter and Facebook have evolved into very different products from their original forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>.

## The Demand for Privacy-Focused Alternatives

There is a noticeable desire among users for more private and closed-off social networks, contrasting with the increasingly public nature of mainstream platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:37:00">[28:37:00]</a>.

### Path: A Historical Precedent
Path was a private social network that gained traction approximately 10 to 12 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>. Its core premise was a closed network for close friends and family members, typically limiting connections to around 75 to 150 friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:00]</a>. This limit was based on Dunbar's Number, a sociological theory suggesting that humans can only maintain about 150 stable connections at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>.

Path was considered the "anti-version" of the social networks prevalent at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>. It provided a more intimate experience, allowing users to share moments, status updates, and locations with a trusted circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>. Path also incorporated features like showing "Good morning from Hayes Valley" to indicate a user's neighborhood, making interactions feel more personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:00">[28:57:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Path was acquired by Google for approximately $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:33:00">[25:33:00]</a>. Its monetization included selling sticker packs, but a subscription model ($20-$30/year) could also be viable for a similar concept today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>.

### The "Anti-TripAdvisor" Concept
The current travel experience is heavily influenced by SEO-optimized platforms like Trip Advisor and Expedia, leading many travelers to visit the same popular spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. There's a recognized need for an "anti-TripAdvisor" approach, particularly among millennials and Gen Z, who prefer to explore less-traveled paths and discover local, hidden gems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

Current trends show people using platforms like TikTok and Instagram Maps to find unique coffee shops, bookstores, and other local spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. This indicates a shift in how people seek recommendations, moving away from traditional review sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. An app that curates these types of discoveries, potentially via video carousels akin to TikTok, could be highly appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

The development of such an app could leverage [[building_social_apps_with_ai | AI]] and no-code tools for quick prototyping, potentially even automating content creation from existing social media videos using APIs for transcription and content cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

### "Time Capsules of Shared Memories"
Another idea for a privacy-focused social concept revolves around "time capsules of shared memories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:44:00">[34:44:00]</a>. This concept aims to address the issue of digital shared albums where "memories go to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">[34:37:00]</a>.

The idea is to allow users to create and send curated, ephemeral time capsules of memories (photos, memorabilia) to friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>. This builds on the human love for [[nostalgia_in_social_media | nostalgia]], a powerful emotion that Clout, another past social network, successfully leveraged by reminding users of old memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:37:00">[36:37:00]</a>. While Clout struggled with sustainability due to a lack of its own network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09:00">[38:09:00]</a>, the underlying human desire to relive shared moments remains strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>. This physical or digitally curated format would sit between a casual text message photo and a physical photo album <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:30:00">[40:30:00]</a>.

## [[safety_and_privacy_considerations_with_ai_models | Safety and Privacy Considerations with AI Models]]

The future of app monetization may involve users committing personal, anonymized data for training large language models (LLMs) in exchange for premium subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:00">[33:13:00]</a>. This suggests a potential shift from traditional SaaS subscription models to a data-for-service exchange, raising questions about data privacy and how "anonymized" data would truly be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:00">[33:13:00]</a>.

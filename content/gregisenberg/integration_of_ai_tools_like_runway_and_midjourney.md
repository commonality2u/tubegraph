Brett from Designjoy, a solo designer making millions annually, leverages AI to generate high-quality designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The process of arriving at beautifully generated graphics is surprisingly simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, dispelling the notion of magic behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Core AI Design Workflow

The speaker emphasizes that anyone, regardless of prior design knowledge, can create valuable assets using these [[ai_automation_tools_for_workflows | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. While having good taste helps, it's not a skill barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The current generative AI phase includes image, video, and other forms of generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Higsfield: Easy Entry into AI Creation

For those new to [[ai_automation_tools_for_workflows | AI creation]], Higsfield offers an easy starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. It provides templates, essentially preset actions and effects, simplifying the process of interacting with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Users can select a preset, upload a product image, and generate results quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This tool is particularly useful for generating product ads, even accurately maintaining text on product branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. While easy to use, it's primarily for fun or creating Instagram ads, not the main focus of advanced AI generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Midjourney: Image Generation & Artistic Styling

[[exploring_midjourneys_tools_and_features | Midjourney]] is the primary tool for generating images, acting as a base for video creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. It excels in styling and artistic output, making it ideal for creating visually striking assets like vintage aerial photos or brand directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

The [[practical_applications_and_workflows_in_midjourney | Midjourney]] system involves:
*   **Text Prompts**: Users describe what they want to generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Image Prompts**: Inserting a photo influences the generated image's content, such as including a person or object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Style References**: Uploading an image as a style reference ensures the generated image adopts its colors, shadows, highlights, and depth of field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

Combining image and style prompts can lead to surprising and unique generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### ChatGPT: The Prompt Engineer

The quality of generated images heavily relies on the prompt provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. ChatGPT plays a crucial role in prompt creation, making prompting less of a specialized skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. While historically requiring "author-level skills" to describe visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, ChatGPT can now generate well-structured and detailed prompts from simple requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

For example, a user can request image prompts for a specific scene (e.g., a cowboy on a horse) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. ChatGPT provides multiple options, expanding simple ideas with rich details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This allows for iterative refinement, generating different angles or scenes within a consistent style simply by telling ChatGPT what to focus on next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. It can even conceptualize collections of images with different environments but tied to a common theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

The synergy is clear: ChatGPT creates effective prompts, and [[exploring_midjourneys_tools_and_features | Midjourney]] brings them to life, often paired with a style image from sources like Pinterest for stylistic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Adding Motion with Runway

Once static images are created, tools like Runway (and others like Cling, Korea) can add motion, turning images into dynamic videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Runway is considered high-quality for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Video Creation

The process involves:
1.  **Image Selection**: Choose a base image, often generated in [[practical_applications_and_workflows_in_midjourney | Midjourney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
2.  **Prompt Generation for Motion**: Use ChatGPT to create a detailed prompt instructing Runway on the desired movements (e.g., "soft ripples in the water," "trees blowing softly in the wind") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. ChatGPT understands the specific needs of Runway for text-based prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
3.  **Runway Upload & Generation**: Upload the image to Runway, paste the ChatGPT-generated prompt, and select settings like aspect ratio (e.g., square for X/Twitter posts) and duration (typically 5-10 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.
4.  **Upscaling**: Videos can be upscaled to 4K with a single click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

Runway, like other [[ai_automation_tools_for_workflows | AI tools]], is not perfect and may sometimes produce unexpected results or artifacts, requiring prompt adjustments and re-tries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

### Enhancing Video Output

*   **Looping**: Tools like Cling offer "start and end frame" capabilities, allowing videos to loop seamlessly by using the same image for both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **AI Sound**: After video generation, some tools provide AI-generated sound options based on the video's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Extended Videos**: To create longer continuous shots beyond the typical 10-second limit, users can save the last frame of a video as an image, then use it as the starting frame for the next video, stitching them together in a simple video editing tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   **Adding Text**: For text overlays, it's recommended to export the AI-generated video and add text using user-friendly video editing platforms like CapCut, as direct AI text integration can be less flexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

## Broader Applications & Opportunities

The ease of use means individuals without traditional design backgrounds can generate professional-looking assets quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

### Accessibility for Non-Designers

Many AI-generated visuals, initially perceived as complex, are achievable by non-designers within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. The content is often geared towards anyone with a [[practical_applications_and_workflows_in_midjourney | Midjourney]] or Chat subscription, not just professional designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Branding and Consistent Assets

For startups and side hustles, the biggest opportunity lies in branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. While web design with AI is still developing, branding is "amazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. [[practical_applications_and_workflows_in_midjourney | Midjourney]] allows for creating mood boards by setting up a specific code as a prompt, referencing a collection of images to ensure continuity and consistency across generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. This enables rapid generation of cohesive assets for social media posts, backgrounds, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. This is a significant [[how_to_effectively_use_ai_tools_in_startups | leverage point for startups]] to produce consistent creative assets quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

### Limitations of AI Design Tools

Despite their power, current AI tools have limitations:
*   **Logo Design**: They are not good at direct logo design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.
*   **Text**: Text generation within images is not always perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   **Vector Art**: They do not produce vector art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

These limitations mean traditional designers are still needed for specific elements, but once those are set, AI can rapidly build out additional creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

## Conclusion: Get Started with AI

The core advice is to "get your hands dirty" and start experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. Users should utilize ChatGPT to help communicate with [[ai_automation_tools_for_workflows | AI tools]], learn the strengths of different tools, and stick with a few favorites to master them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. The ability to achieve remarkable results with minimal effort is a key, often unacknowledged, benefit of AI in design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

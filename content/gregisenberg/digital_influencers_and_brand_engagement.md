Brands may increasingly choose to own [[digital influencers and brand engagement | digital influencers]] to foster [[influencer marketing and consumer engagement | brand engagement]] and create conversation around their ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. This approach offers several advantages over traditional [[influencer marketing techniques | influencer marketing]] with human celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

## Advantages of Digital Influencers
*   **Cost-effectiveness** Digital influencers are expected to be significantly cheaper to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.
*   **Risk Mitigation** Unlike human celebrities, [[digital influencers and brand engagement | digital influencers]] cannot generate scandals that could damage a brand's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. For example, a public incident involving a human face of a brand like Coach could lead to them being "bad goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Consistency** Digital influencers offer greater consistency, always remaining "on brand" and fulfilling their promised work, leading to more predictable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
*   **Digital Asset** They can be considered a digital asset that a brand owns, similar to a YouTube channel or email list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. This asset contributes to a balance sheet based on the cumulative impressions generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Connection** By putting a "face to a brand," [[digital influencers and brand engagement | digital influencers]] can make a brand more relatable and impactful in consumers' minds, similar to how iconic founders like Steve Jobs become synonymous with their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

## Creation and Evolution
The concept of [[digital influencers and brand engagement | digital influencers]] stemmed from early examples like Lil Michaela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Creating these characters involves using generative AI tools like Stable Diffusion or Flux to generate a person or license a likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. These AI models can be trained on the chosen persona to craft their lifestyle and narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Tools like Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Focus (a free alternative) can be used, along with features like "face lock" for consistency across different generations and AI-powered editing tools like MockMoi.ai and Canva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

The initial versions of [[digital influencers and brand engagement | digital influencers]] featured flat images that later evolved into super realistic short-form videos and GIFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. As technology advances, it's possible to create essentially "face video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

The evolution of [[digital influencers and brand engagement | digital influencers]] is expected to progress from agencies providing these services to companies, eventually becoming an internal team function within larger corporations. These internal teams would be responsible for [[building a brand and creating influence | building networks]] and communities around their owned digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

## Impact on Brand Engagement
Digital influencers can create engaging "lore" and narratives around a brand, similar to how fantasy fandoms develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. This fosters dialogue and deeper [[influencer marketing and consumer engagement | buy-in]] from audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. Consumers are likely to engage with this content as entertainment, even if aware it is fictional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

The rise of [[digital influencers and brand engagement | digital influencers]] reflects a broader trend where young people aspire to be creators like YouTubers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. Brands could tap into this by hiring creators on salary to produce content weekly, measuring success by the virality of their videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## Real-world Examples
An example of an AI influencer gaining traction is Aitana Lopez from Barcelona, created by an art collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. This collective explored monetization by selling content on platforms like OnlyFans, generating significant revenue in the first 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

This trend is seen as an "inevitability" for Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) companies, given the cost-effectiveness and reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. It is also predicted to trickle down from D2C into B2B sectors, as corporations seek a consistent spokesperson for centuries without scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. This forms an "owned media asset" for the brand long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.

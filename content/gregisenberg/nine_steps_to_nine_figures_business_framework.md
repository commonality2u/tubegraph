The "Nine Steps to Nine Figures" is a business framework designed to guide founders through the evolution of their companies, from initial startup to achieving a nine-figure valuation (over $100 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This framework emphasizes different strategic focuses at each stage of a company's growth, acknowledging that the way a business is run must change as it scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:17">[03:16:17]</a>.

## Overview of the Framework

Most founders have approximately five years of dedicated, focused, obsessive energy to invest in their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The goal of this framework is to leverage that energy to achieve a $100 million business within that timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The framework is divided into three distinct phases: Startup, Scaleup, and Growup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>.

## The Three Phases

### 1. Startup Phase (Getting to Product-Market Fit)

This initial phase focuses on achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:05">[03:05:05]</a>. It consists of three key steps:

*   **Persona (Market)**: Deeply understanding who you are selling to, who loves your product, and who refers new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:21">[03:21:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Every business should start with defining its market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:25">[03:24:25]</a>.
*   **Product**: Determining what exactly you are selling to that identified market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:29">[03:29:29]</a>.
*   **Promotion**: Figuring out how to sell your product at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:32">[03:31:32]</a>.

Product-market fit is achieved when a business feels like "you're wearing a meat suit in a dog park," meaning you have more leads than you can handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:42">[03:42:42]</a>. This typically occurs around the mid-seven-figure revenue mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:36">[03:35:36]</a>.

### 2. Scaleup Phase (Company Creation)

Once product-market fit is established and the business is generating significant leads, the focus shifts to building out the company structure to handle and accelerate growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:53">[03:52:53]</a>. This phase also comprises three steps:

*   **Process**: Optimizing internal operations for efficiency and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:05">[06:05:05]</a>. A highly optimized, automated, and software-driven business is preferred over a bureaucratic one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:05">[06:05:05]</a>.
*   **People**: Building a small, high-performing team of "A-players" who are enjoyable to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:15">[06:15:15]</a>. The emphasis is on quality over quantity, leveraging technology like AI to reduce the need for a large workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:10">[06:10:10]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Managing the team by providing clear scoreboards, incentives, and compensation packages that align with company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:48">[06:46:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:01">[07:01:01]</a>.

#### Incentive Structures

For executive roles like a COO, an ideal incentive structure is a 50/50 split between top-line revenue growth and bottom-line profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:35">[09:34:35]</a>. This ensures alignment with the founder's goals, preventing a sole focus on cost-cutting (profit-based incentive) or unsustainable revenue growth (revenue-based incentive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:42">[09:42:42]</a>.

On the topic of compensation, offering equity to employees has not shown a marked increase in performance, as most employees do not understand how to value it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:16">[11:16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:27">[11:27:27]</a>. A more effective approach is to present a total compensation package and allow the employee to decide how much of it they want as cash bonus versus equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:46">[11:46:46]</a>. This makes the equity feel like an investment, creating genuine buy-in and alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:18">[12:18:18]</a>.

### 3. Growup Phase (Legacy Protection)

This final phase, beyond the $100 million mark, focuses on maintaining and protecting the legacy of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:12">[03:10:12]</a>.

## Key Scaling Strategies

### The Triple Triple Double Double Revenue Strategy

This strategy outlines a path to grow a $3 million business to $108 million in approximately five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>:

*   **Triple Revenue** three times:
    *   $3 million to $9 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>
    *   $9 million to $27 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>
    *   $27 million to $81 million (implied, as the next step is doubling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>
*   **Double Revenue** twice:
    *   $27 million to $54 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>
    *   $54 million to $108 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>

This strategy focuses on identifying and removing bottlenecks, whether in sales (not enough leads or salespeople) or delivery (inefficient processes, quality issues, high churn) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:16">[05:16:16]</a>.

### Focus on Retention over Churn

Instead of focusing on churn, which can be seen as a negative, businesses should prioritize **loyalty**, measured by Net Revenue Retention (NRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:34">[01:34:34]</a>. A 3% increase in Net Revenue Retention can double a company's valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>.

Net Revenue Retention means that an existing cohort of customers spends more with you over time, rather than just avoiding churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. This organic growth from existing customers makes it much easier to scale the business profitably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:44">[01:44:44]</a>.

Founders should focus on retention and customer loyalty *before* aggressively pursuing growth through marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. Building a strong, loyal customer base creates a solid foundation, like building a skyscraper on a firm foundation rather than sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:56">[01:56:56]</a>.

### Growth Channels and Marketing Investment

For marketing, an 80/20 rule is suggested:
*   **80% Investment**: Allocate 80% of money, time, and energy to proven, consistent marketing channels (like "index funds") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>.
*   **20% Experimentation**: Dedicate 20% to exploring new channels or opportunities that have the potential to become future "rocket ships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>. This diversification prevents reliance on a single channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>.

### Impact vs. Effort Matrix for Decision-Making

When evaluating opportunities, such as acquisitions, use an "Impact versus Effort Matrix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:45">[02:44:45]</a>. Rank opportunities based on:
*   **Effort**: How much effort will it take (1-5, with 1 being lowest effort) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:52">[02:51:52]</a>.
*   **Impact**: What is the potential impact on the business (1-5, with 5 being massive impact) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:53">[02:52:53]</a>.

The goal is to find "10 out of 10 ideas" â€“ those with low effort and massive impact (e.g., a 5 in effort and a 5 in impact) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:56">[02:56:56]</a>. Founders should prioritize opportunities within their existing business that offer high ROI before pursuing external "shiny objects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>.

### Team Building and Identifying Zone of Genius

To build a high-performing executive team, identify the core bottlenecks in the business: **sales or delivery** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:16">[04:14:16]</a>. The two primary executive roles are Chief Revenue Officer (for sales) and Chief Operating Officer (for delivery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:28">[04:27:28]</a>.

Founders should first hire executives in their own "zone of genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:32">[04:31:32]</a>. This allows the founder to properly evaluate, train, and manage that individual, as they understand what "genius looks like" in that area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:32">[04:32:32]</a>.

To identify one's zone of genius, observe:
*   What activities in your calendar excite you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:45">[04:43:45]</a>?
*   What tasks do you naturally gravitate towards or tinker with in the morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:51">[04:49:51]</a>?
*   Where does your motivation go when you have an empty calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:52">[04:51:52]</a>?

### Founder vs. CEO Role

The founder is often the hardest-working person, focused on discovery and building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:11">[04:09:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:11">[04:09:11]</a>. The CEO's ultimate goal is to become the "laziest person at the company," by delegating everything off their plate to focus on thinking multiple quarters or years ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:16">[04:15:16]</a>.

Founders "discover flight," but then need to hand off the baton to a CEO to "scale flight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:11">[04:09:11]</a>. If a founder's passion is building and creating new ventures, they should hire a COO or President to execute their vision for existing businesses, or a CEO if they are no longer passionate about the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:19">[04:17:19]</a>. The mistake is returning to "tinker mode" before the existing business is stable and scaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:22">[04:21:22]</a>.

### The Importance of Focus and Market Dominance

Instead of building "strip malls" (multiple small, unscaled businesses), focus on building "skyscrapers" (deeply expanding upon a single, successful business model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:38">[04:38:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:40">[04:40:40]</a>.

When entering a market, ask: "Can I be the gold medalist in this scenario?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a> The market disproportionately rewards the best, with 99.9% of the rewards going to the market leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:13">[05:11:13]</a>. Define the specific arena in which you compete and strive to be the best within that niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:17">[05:16:17]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

*   **AppSumo**: By deeply understanding their most profitable customer segment (marketing agencies) and focusing on selling more software deals to them, AppSumo tripled its customer lifetime value and overall business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:42">[04:42:42]</a>. This involved scaling from one software deal per quarter to one per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>.
*   **Costco (James Sinegal)**: Admired for its relentless focus on pricing and strategy, international expansion, and reinvesting profits to deepen customer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:48">[04:48:48]</a>. Costco's model exemplifies building a "skyscraper" by focusing on core strengths and expanding within that established model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:38">[04:38:38]</a>.
*   **"Test Then Invest" Framework**: Allocate 20% of resources (money, time, energy) to experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:59">[04:59:59]</a>. For example, testing an affiliate model by manually paying top referrers via PayPal, then investing in proper software once the positive impact is proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:10">[05:08:10]</a>. The founder's role is to discover revenue channels, not to hire to discover them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:18">[05:17:18]</a>.

Ultimately, the [[Nine steps to nine figures business framework | Nine Steps to Nine Figures]] provides a roadmap for ambitious founders to navigate the complexities of scaling, emphasizing strategic focus, strong fundamentals, and disciplined execution to achieve significant business growth and financial optionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>.

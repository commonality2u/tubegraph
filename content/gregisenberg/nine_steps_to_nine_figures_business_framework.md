The "Nine Steps to Nine Figures" is a business framework designed to guide founders through the different stages of [[scaling_and_building_a_business_over_time | building a business]] to a $100 million valuation within a focused five-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This framework acknowledges that most individuals have about five years of dedicated, obsessive energy to invest in their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Three Phases of Growth

The framework is divided into three distinct phases, each requiring a different approach to running the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>:

1.  **Startup**: Focused on achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
2.  **Scale-up**: Centered around company creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
3.  **Grow-up**: Aimed at legacy protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### 1. Startup Phase (Product-Market Fit)

This initial phase is about finding and validating your product within a specific market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. It's typically considered complete around the mid-seven figures revenue mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

*   **Persona**: Identify and deeply understand your target customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Every business should start with market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Product**: Determine what you are selling to that identified market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Promotion**: Figure out how to sell your product at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

You know you've hit product-market fit when you have "more leads than you know what to do with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Many founders struggle at this point because they don't know the next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### 2. Scale-up Phase (Company Creation)

This phase focuses on building the operational structure to support rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This is where founders transition from being product-led to building a comprehensive company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

*   **Process**: Develop highly optimized and automated processes, ideally software-driven and leveraging AI, to avoid bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **People**: Focus on having a handful of "A players" rather than a large, bureaucratic team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The goal is to build a highly optimized business, not just one full of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Manage team performance by providing clear "scoreboards," incentives, and compensation packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The founder's role is to draw up the next play from the sideline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

#### Incentive Structures

A common mistake in incentive structures is focusing solely on profit (leading to cost-cutting without growth) or solely on revenue (leading to unprofitable growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

*   **Ideal Structure**: A 50/50 split on bonuses, with half tied to Top Line (revenue) and half to Bottom Line (profitability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This fosters founder alignment, where the individual considers both growth and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Equity vs. Cash**: Harvard research found no significant performance increase from handing out equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, partly because most employees don't understand how to value it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
    *   **Proposed Model**: When offering equity, integrate it into a total compensation package, allowing the employee to decide how much of their bonus they want in cash versus equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This makes the equity feel like an investment, giving them skin in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

#### Avoiding a "Sandy Foundation"

Ignoring fundamental issues like retention and process early on is like building a skyscraper on a sandy foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Companies that reach mid-seven figures without these fundamentals often face massive churn, struggle with profitable growth, and lead to founder burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Focusing on these elements early provides a preview of what's needed for future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

## Triple Triple Double Double Revenue Growth Strategy

This strategy aims to achieve rapid growth to reach a $100 million valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

*   **Definition**: Triple your revenue three times, then double it twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Example**: A $3 million business can become a $108 million business in five years:
    *   3x: $3M → $9M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
    *   3x: $9M → $27M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
    *   2x: $27M → $54M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
    *   2x: $54M → $108M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
    This level of growth provides optionality for a $100 million exit or continued market domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Prioritizing Loyalty and Retention

Before focusing on promotion and growth, prioritize retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

*   **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)**: This metric measures not just avoiding churn, but how to get more loyalty and spending from each existing customer cohort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
    *   *Calculation*: If a January cohort spends $X, and in February they spend more than $X (due to increased usage, features, etc.), then your NRR is above 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
    *   *Impact*: Every 3% increase in NRR can double a company's valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. It makes business growth and future exit much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   **Building a Skyscraper, Not a Strip Mall**: Focus on expanding upon an existing successful business (going deeper) rather than constantly creating new business units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
    *   *Example: AppSumo*: By analyzing customer data, AppSumo identified marketing agencies as their most profitable segment (80% of top customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>. They focused on offering more software deals (what agencies wanted to reduce monthly spend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>. This focus tripled their customer lifetime value and subsequently their entire business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

### Growth Channel Allocation (80/20 Rule)

Think of marketing channels like an investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

*   **80% "Index Funds"**: Allocate 80% of your investment (money, time, people) to the primary marketing channel that consistently produces results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
*   **20% "Rocket Ship" Investments**: Dedicate 20% to exploring new channels with high potential, to ensure you're not reliant on a single channel and can recover if one fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

### [[Decisionmaking framework for strategic business growth | Decision-Making for Acquisitions]]

When considering opportunities like strategic acquisitions, use an Impact vs. Effort Matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

*   **Shield vs. Sword**: This framework assesses how much effort an acquisition will take (shield) versus its potential impact (sword) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
*   **Ranking**: Rank opportunities from 1 to 5 for both effort and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. Look for "10 out of 10" ideas (e.g., 5 effort, 5 impact) that are easy to do but have massive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.
*   **Internal Opportunities First**: Often, the most impactful opportunities with the lowest effort are already within your existing business, not external acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

### Founder vs. CEO Role

*   **Founder as Artist, CEO as Manager**: Founders are artists who discover and build, while CEOs manage and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. It's difficult to transition from holding the paintbrush to picking up the clipboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.
*   **Handing Off the Baton**: Once a founder has "discovered flight" (achieved mid-seven figures), their primary job is to determine if they are the right CEO for the next phase of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. If not, they should hire a COO or President to execute their vision, or even a CEO if they're not passionate about the business, allowing them to return to "tinker mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.
*   **Identifying Your Zone of Genius**: Determine what activities excite you and where you naturally spend your time (e.g., sales, product tinkering, customer calls) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>. This indicates where your greatest value lies.
*   **The Lazy CEO**: The ultimate goal for a founder transitioning to CEO is to gradually get everything off their plate, becoming the "laziest person at the company" by thinking several quarters ahead instead of being bogged down in day-to-day tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>.

### Relentless Focus and Market Leadership

*   **Gold Medalist Mindset**: In most markets, only the winner or the "gold medalist" captures the vast majority of the rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. Do not enter a market unless you believe you can be the best in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.
*   **Defining Your Arena**: Markets can be broadly defined or highly niched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. Ask yourself, "In what arena are we competing, and can we be the best in it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   **Example: James Sinegal (Costco Founder)**: Admired for his focus on core business, pricing strategy, and giving back to entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. Costco's strategy involves expanding internationally and deepening customer loyalty in existing markets, rather than diversifying their core model significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. They reinvest profits to lower prices and increase buying power, building more customer loyalty and becoming the most profitable retail facility per square inch in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.

The Nine Steps to Nine Figures framework provides a roadmap for entrepreneurs to systematically build and scale their businesses, emphasizing strategic focus, operational excellence, and long-term vision.

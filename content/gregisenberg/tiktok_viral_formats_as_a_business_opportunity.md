The current digital landscape presents a significant opportunity to build businesses around [[viral_content_creation_for_apps_on_social_media | viral content creation]], particularly concerning TikTok's constantly evolving trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This stems from the fact that individuals and brands are actively seeking the latest viral formats and TikTok templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. The demand is evident with "TikTok template" searches reaching approximately 98,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.

## The Opportunity

The core opportunity lies in helping users discover and apply TikTok formats that are currently going viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. This addresses a clear market need, as demonstrated by companies like Lauren's app, which leveraged TikTok to achieve 100,000 App Store downloads in just 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>, showcasing the power of [[effective_use_of_tiktok_and_social_media_for_app_marketing | TikTok marketing strategies for consumer apps]] and [[utilizing_tiktok_creators_for_app_promotions | utilizing TikTok creators for app promotions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

## Business Model: Newsletter and Beyond

A viable business model begins with an email newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. This newsletter would deliver weekly updates on "the formats that are going viral this week on Tik Tok" and provide guidance on "how you can go and use these for your brand right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.

### Evolution of the Service
The business can evolve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>:
*   **Initial Phase (Newsletter):** Similar to Jason Levan's Memelord Technologies, which daily provides viral meme templates that link directly to an editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>. The TikTok version would offer a similar one-button click to an editor where users can create their own versions of the viral templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Future Development (Software):** The service could eventually grow into a full-fledged video editor specifically designed for TikTok, or a social media scheduling application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   **Monetization:** The email list can be monetized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>, potentially offering a freemium model where the free version provides weekly updates, while a paid version offers daily insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

## Acquisition Strategy: Twitter Threads

A highly effective acquisition strategy involves creating Twitter threads that detail "the five formats that are going viral on Tik Tok this week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. Each format would be broken down with examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. At the end of the thread, a call to action would invite users to "join my email newsletter for to get these you know daily or whatever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. This method is effective because it provides immediate value and encourages subscription for ongoing, timely insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.

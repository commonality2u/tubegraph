## AI Tools for Creative Generation

The realm of generative AI includes image, video, and various other forms of content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For those new to AI creation, a step-by-step approach starting with easier tools is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Accessibility for Non-Designers
AI tools are designed to be user-friendly, allowing even non-designers to create "insane value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Most content is geared towards anyone with subscriptions like Midjourney or ChatGPT, requiring no prior design knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Having good taste helps, but there's no "skill issue" for non-creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Higsfield: Easy Entry for AI Creation
Higsfield is an ideal starting point for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. It offers templates and presets, simplifying the process of communicating with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. For example, it can take a product image, apply a preset, and generate a dynamic ad video that incorporates branding and maintains text on the product, overcoming a common challenge in AI generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This tool is quick and doesn't require prompting, though specific prompts can be used for highly customized results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. It's great for creating quick ads for social media platforms like Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Midjourney and ChatGPT: The Core Combination
While many AI tools exist (e.g., Cling, Korea, Visual Electric, Flora) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, Midjourney and ChatGPT are the most frequently used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

*   **Midjourney** is exceptional for artistic styling and image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It excels at creating artistic images with specific aesthetic directions, like vintage aerial photos or surfer themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT** is used when specific details or realistic elements are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. It can realistically insert elements into images more effectively than Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

The key is using them together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. AI systems are only as good as the prompt or reference image provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

#### Mastering Prompts with ChatGPT
Prompting, once considered a specialized skill requiring "author level skills," is no longer a barrier thanks to advanced AI like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. ChatGPT is highly effective at generating detailed image prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Users can provide a simple idea to ChatGPT, and it will expand upon it, providing well-structured prompt options that a person might never conceive on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This allows for iterative refinement, enabling users to request specific changes (e.g., "zoom in on the cowboy's hat") and receive consistent, rich details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. ChatGPT can even dream up entire collections of scenes that maintain thematic consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

#### Image and Style References
Midjourney utilizes:
*   **Image Prompts:** Inserting a photo influences the generated image to include similar objects or elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Style References:** Using a reference image ensures the generated image adopts similar colors, shadows, highlights, and depth of field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Mixing different styles can lead to surprising and cool generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Pinterest is a "phenomenal" resource for finding stylistic directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### Runway and Cling: Adding Motion and Sound
Once images are generated, they can be enhanced with motion and sound.
*   **Runway:** This tool allows users to upload an image and add motion to it using a prompt (which can be generated by ChatGPT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Runway can understand specific instructions like "soft ripples in the water" or "trees blowing softly in the wind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Videos are typically 5 to 10 seconds long and can be upscaled to 4K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   **Cling:** Another image-to-video tool, Cling supports "start and end frame" functionality, enabling seamless video loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. It also offers an AI sound option that generates contextually relevant audio for the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Continuous Shots:** By saving the last frame of a video as an image and using it as the starting frame for the next video, users can create continuous shots of any desired length, then stitch them together with basic video editing tools like Cap Cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
*   **Other Tools:** Magnific Upscaler can be used to add rich details to images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### Current Limitations and Solutions
AI tools, while powerful, are "far from perfect" and can be "finicky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. Users may encounter weird artifacts and need to adjust prompts or retry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. For tasks like adding text on top of AI-generated videos, it's best to use traditional, user-friendly video platforms like Cap Cut, where text layers can be easily added and positioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

## [[business_opportunities_in_ai_for_solo_entrepreneurs_and_small_businesses | Opportunities in AI for Startups and Creatives]]
The biggest [[opportunities_for_ai_consulting_and_agency_services | opportunity for creatives]] and [[leveraging_ai_in_startup_development | startups leveraging AI]] today lies in **branding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

*   **Consistent Asset Generation:** Designers or even individuals can create a "mood board" in Midjourney based on a single asset they like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. This mood board generates a unique code that, when used as a prompt, ensures all subsequent content references back to the initial style, providing consistent and cohesive branding assets at a fast pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   **Targeted Content Creation:** For example, a real estate photographer could use AI to generate different angles of a building for a listing or magazine, then add motion and stitch them together for a multi-scene video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>. This is particularly useful for creating advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
*   **Backgrounds and E-commerce:** AI can generate psychedelic or cool background images for product placements in e-commerce shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

While web design hasn't fully matured in AI yet, branding is where the most significant leverage point is found for generating consistent assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. However, AI currently has limitations in areas like logo design, generating entire brands, perfect text, or vector art, meaning traditional designers are still needed for some pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

## Getting Started
The advice for anyone interested is to "get your hands dirty" and start experimenting with these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. Utilize ChatGPT to assist in communicating with AI tools and understand which tools excel at different tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. Don't be overwhelmed by the number of tools; pick a few that resonate, stick with them, and learn their functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

AI enables individuals to achieve "remarkable things with very little effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. The goal is to break down barriers and show that nearly anyone can create beautiful and complex designs using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.

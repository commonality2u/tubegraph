Building a successful business can originate from identifying and solving a personal problem, then validating that this problem is shared by enough people willing to pay for a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. This approach allows entrepreneurs to pursue ideas they are genuinely passionate about and have an intrinsic understanding of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>.

## Origin Story: Kettle & Fire

Justin Mayers, co-founder of Kettle & Fire, started his company in 2014 from a personal need for bone broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:11">[01:29:11]</a>. While working at Rackspace, he wanted to [[starting_a_solopreneur_business_with_simple_ideas | start his own company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>. He had heard about bone broth from friends in the CrossFit community and was reading about its benefits for skin, gut, and joint health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:11">[01:40:11]</a>. At the time, bone broth was not widely discussed, and it was difficult to find online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>.

Mayers identified a product he wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:11">[01:56:11]</a> and sought to answer two main questions before proceeding:
1.  How many people actually want this product? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:11">[02:01:11]</a>
2.  Are there enough people, or will they spend enough, to create a meaningful business? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:11">[02:06:11]</a>

His initial goal was modest: for his brother and him to earn $10,000 each per month, equivalent to a $200,000 per year business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:11">[03:42:11]</a>. This required only a couple of thousand customers spending a few hundred dollars a year each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:11">[03:55:11]</a>.

## Validating the Idea Without Building

A key aspect of Mayers' process was to [[startup_ideas_with_low_initial_investment | validate a startup idea]] without fully building the product first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Market Validation

Mayers performed market research on two levels:

*   **Micro Level (Community Engagement):** He investigated online communities where paleo and CrossFit enthusiasts gathered, such as Mark's Daily Apple, Paleo Hacks, and Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:11">[02:32:11]</a>. He observed how much traffic these sites received and the engagement level of threads discussing bone broth for skin, gut, and joint health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:11">[02:43:11]</a>. The "super engaged" discussions about recipes and sourcing indicated a fanatic and interested group of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:11">[02:53:11]</a>.
*   **Macro Level (Trending Data):** He used [[building_a_startup_using_seo_and_niche_sites | Google Trends]] to see if "bone broth" was gaining popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:11">[03:17:11]</a>. The data showed that it was "starting to take off," with more people discussing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:11">[03:21:11]</a>. This confirmed there were at least several thousand people interested in the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:11">[03:30:11]</a>. Mayers emphasizes that while he used Google Trends, his initial idea stemmed from a personal problem and passion, with trends serving as validation, not the sole source of the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:11">[04:17:11]</a>.

### Demand Validation (Fake Sales)

To determine if people would pay for the product, Mayers conducted a lean, low-cost experiment:

1.  **Low-Cost Setup:** He bought the cheapest bone broth-related domain name available ($9.99) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:11">[06:11:11]</a>, paid $5 on Fiverr for a simple logo and renders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:11">[06:35:11]</a>, and built a landing page using Unbounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:11">[06:50:11]</a>.
2.  **Value Propositions:** The landing page highlighted benefits identified from Paleo forums, such as healing leaky gut, convenience (due to the 24-48 hour cooking time for bone broth), and the use of organic, 100% grass-fed ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:11">[07:04:11]</a>.
3.  **Pricing Strategy:** He set a price of $29.99 for 16 ounces, which was about six times the cost of regular broth or stock at the grocery store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:11">[07:45:11]</a>. This high price point was chosen to ensure profitability if demand existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:11">[07:58:11]</a>.
4.  **"Sketchy" Checkout:** The "Order Bone Broth Now" button led directly to his personal PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:11">[08:20:11]</a>.
5.  **Ad Campaign:** Mayers spent about $100 on Bing Ads, as it was cheaper than Google Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:11">[08:51:11]</a>.
6.  **Results:** Despite the sketchy checkout flow and lack of an actual product, people converted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:11">[09:14:11]</a>. Over a two-week test, the site achieved a 30% conversion rate on clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:11">[09:20:11]</a>, generating almost $500 in "revenue" against $250 in ad costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:11">[09:33:11]</a>. This indicated a strong potential for a $100,000 per year business even under these "janky" conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:11">[09:59:11]</a>.

### Post-Validation Customer Management

After validating demand, Mayers emailed every customer who had placed an order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>. He explained that the product was not yet in stock and offered a full refund or a 50% discount if they waited a few weeks (which turned into eight months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. Most customers chose the 50% discount, demonstrating a strong willingness to wait for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:11">[01:40:11]</a>. This allowed Mayers to start Kettle & Fire, which eventually grew into a [[scaling_a_business_from_zero_to_nine_figures | 9-figure annual business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.

## Building a Business in 2025

Mayers reflects on how the process of [[starting an online business in the current digital landscape | starting an online business]] has changed, especially with the rise of [[building_a_business_with_ai_tools | AI tools]].

*   **Improved Design & Tools:** Landing pages and logos can be much better designed today using [[building_a_business_with_ai_tools | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:11">[02:43:11]</a>. Tools like Bolt.new and Rok can assist with building landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:11">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** AI and other tools can quickly scrape and analyze sentiment across Reddit, forums, and Twitter to gauge public interest and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:11">[01:13:01]</a>. This allows for quick distillation of data, which can then be used to craft clear problem statements for product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:11">[01:18:48]</a>.
*   **Rapid Prototyping:** With [[building_a_business_with_ai_tools | AI tools]] like ChatGPT4o, a functional beverage concept can be redesigned or a new product line can be envisioned from a single prompt in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:11">[02:20:31]</a>. This drastically reduces the time and cost associated with design and concept development, making it possible to test dozens of [[startup_ideas_for_profitable_service_businesses | startup ideas]] per month for a low monthly fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:11">[02:21:52]</a>.
*   **Unchanged Core Principle:** Despite technological advancements, the fundamental principle remains: try to sell a product even if it doesn't exist yet, to see if people will pay for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:11">[01:13:18]</a>. Getting even 10 people to commit to buying the product provides massive validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:11">[01:13:29]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs

Mayers advises people looking for [[startup_ideas_for_profitable_service_businesses | startup ideas]] to focus on areas they are genuinely interested in and passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:11">[01:14:11]</a>.

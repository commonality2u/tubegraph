Online directories offer a significant opportunity for generating passive income, particularly through display advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Frey, an "online directory King," demonstrates how to build and monetize directories that can generate between $2,000 and $10,000 per month in passive income with minimal weekly effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Frey's Approach to Passive Income Directories
Frey's first directory website, built in October 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>, has been monetized for 18 consecutive months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This evergreen, location-based directory requires only about 15 minutes of maintenance per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Last month, it generated approximately $2,300 in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. Display ads have provided Frey with the closest experience to truly passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.

## Successful Examples of Display Ad Monetization

### RoadsideAmerica.com
This directory, focused on quirky roadside attractions in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, receives 85,000 monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Its monetization primarily comes from display ads plastered across the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. With about 96% Tier 1 traffic (US, Canada, Australia, UK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>, it has remained resilient to Google core updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. It is conservatively estimated to make $5,000 to $7,000 per month very passively from display ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. This is a basic, static directory build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

### AtlasObscura.com
This worldwide directory highlights off-the-beaten-path attractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. It attracts 7.6 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>, showing minimal to no effect from Google core updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. With 90-91% Tier 1 traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>, it's monetized through display ads (AdSense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a> and also sells a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. AdSense revenue alone is conservatively estimated at around $30,000 per month, potentially reaching $50,000 or $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

### FindAGrave.com
This morbid-themed directory allows users to find burial sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. It receives a staggering 1.4 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a> and is also resilient to Google updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. Its primary form of monetization is AdSense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>, with 92% Tier 1 traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. It is estimated to generate $60,000 to $70,000 per month, with potential for up to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

## Display Ads for a Lifestyle Business
Frey emphasizes that while there are other [[monetization_strategies_for_aidriven_websites | monetization strategies for AI-driven websites]], such as building software on top of directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>, display ads (like AdSense) are a great option for a lifestyle business due to their passive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. Such a business can provide "mailbox money"â€”enough consistent income to cover bills and rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:32:00">[48:32:00]</a>, allowing the owner to pursue other ventures or full-time jobs they are passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:44:00">[48:44:00]</a>.

## Display Ad Integration with Pillar Page Directories
A recommended strategy for [[starting_an_online_directory | starting an online directory]] and quickly seeing results is to build a static pillar page directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:30:00">[43:30:00]</a>. This format involves creating a single, very long, comprehensive page that targets high-volume, location-based keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:48:00">[43:48:00]</a>.

This format is "perfect for display ad monetization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:27:00">[46:27:00]</a> because:
*   **Length**: The naturally long pages allow for many ad placements, similar to how longer YouTube videos generate more revenue from more ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:33:00">[46:33:00]</a>.
*   **Keyword Clusters**: A single state page can rank for thousands of keywords, primarily city-specific terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:16:00">[47:16:00]</a>, maximizing traffic for ad impressions.

Even simple, "boring" directory designs can be highly effective with this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:45:00">[49:45:00]</a>. Frey's first directory, which generates $2,000-$10,000 per month, is a static directory example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:57:00">[47:57:00]</a>. By focusing on utility and solving a problem for users, traffic can be captured, and then "the lipstick" (design) can be added later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:12:00">[53:12:00]</a>.

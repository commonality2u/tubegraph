A discussion emerged about a viral Twitter post detailing an [[AI mobile app entrepreneurship | AI dating coach app]] reportedly generating significant revenue. While initially thought to be the "Riz" app, it was later clarified that the app making $190,000 per month was actually **Plug AI**, a competitor to Riz AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>.

## The Plug AI and AI Riz Ecosystem

The app in question, Plug AI, is an [[Building iOS apps with AI | AI dating coach]] built on top of Chat GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. It reported $190,000 per month in revenue and 333,000 downloads monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. The founder, a 23-year-old, got the idea from a Tinder subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

The founder leads a three-person development studio called **AI Riz** (or Air RZ), which has launched three apps and is closing in on $500,000 of total revenue per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

The apps under AI Riz include:
*   **Plug AI** – A texting assistant that provides pickup lines based on screenshots of text messages, branded as the "ultimate AI Riz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. The name "Plug" signifies someone who has access or can provide something valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:03]</a>.
*   **Astra** – An AI-powered life advice app designed to help users with challenges, compatibility, personal growth, and dream interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.
*   **Pallet** – An [[AIgenerated assets for mobile app development | AI-driven app]] that determines a user's color season from a selfie, generating a custom color palette, personalized style, and makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

The strategy behind these apps is to leverage existing technology (like ChatGPT) to create specialized "[[AIbased startup ideas and growth strategies | AI coaching]]" tools in different verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. Key to their success is strong branding and positioning, focusing on niche markets rather than trying to be an app for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

## Sustainability and Risks

Despite the significant revenue, questions arose about the sustainability of such businesses, particularly given their reliance on platforms like OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>. Critics often dismiss these as "flash in the pan" ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Profitability
> While Apple takes a third of the revenue, the estimated profit margin for such apps is around 65% or higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. If the current revenue holds, the founder could potentially make close to $4 million in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>.

However, the founder's approach is considered smart because he diversifies his portfolio across multiple apps, reducing dependence on any single one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>. The skills learned in [[AI mobile app entrepreneurship | running these businesses]] are also highly transferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.

The primary goal for many [[AI mobile app entrepreneurship | entrepreneurs]] in this space might not be a massive IPO or exit, but rather generating substantial profit to achieve financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:32:00">[24:32:00]</a>. As one speaker put it, "Sometimes you need to change your world before you change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Acquiring initial capital ("your first nut") enables further growth and investment in causes or personal goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Anti-Trends and Future Opportunities

The rise of [[AI mobile app entrepreneurship | AI coaching apps]] also highlights the potential for "anti-trends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. For example, while Peter Levels has a `therapistai.com` product making $3,000/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>, there's an argument that the demand for human interaction and coaching will persist or even increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Human Coaching as a Premium
> Businesses could emerge that offer human-powered versions of [[AIbased startup ideas and growth strategies | AI coaching concepts]], potentially charging a premium. This "human-back-to-basics" approach could be a way to compete with AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. AI apps could even offer human intervention as a premium upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.

Anti-trends often face less competition compared to trending AI-driven solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. The advice for new [[AI mobile app entrepreneurship | AI app developers]] is to explore non-obvious use cases for AI wrappers, as obvious ones like dating or therapy are already saturated with competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.

[[introduction_to_boltnew | Boltnew]], a new tool for rapid prototyping, has recently launched, with claims it surpasses [[comparison_of_boltnew_and_cursor_ai | Cursor AI]] in ease of use for non-technical individuals to create prototypes quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite its potential, it is an early-stage tool, and users have experienced various issues and bugs, particularly during the deployment phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Initial Bugs and Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>

Upon its launch, [[features_and_challenges_of_boltnew | Boltnew]] was noted to have some initial bugs and be "a little slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The online nature of the platform contributes to its slower performance, requiring more patience from users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Building a Text-to-Image Application: Bug Encounters

During a demonstration of building a text-to-image application using [[introduction_to_bolt_and_its_capabilities | Boltnew]] and the Foul.ai API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, several issues arose:

*   **Project Initialization Glitches**: After the initial prompt to build a Next.js landing page, the preview broke, requiring a manual refresh and prompting the AI to "please fix" the un-rendered content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **API Key Integration Issues**: While the AI successfully guided the user to implement the text generation functionality and prompted for an API key, the application initially failed to generate images, throwing an error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Recurring Runtime Errors**: Even after the AI "fixed" an initial issue, subsequent attempts to generate images continued to break, requiring the user to copy and paste the error messages back to [[introduction_to_boltnew | Boltnew]] for further rectification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

## Deployment Challenges with Netlify

A significant area where [[features_and_challenges_of_boltnew | Boltnew]] demonstrated finicky behavior was during deployment, despite its integration with Netlify for one-click deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

*   **Repeated Build Failures**: The deployment process consistently failed to build the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   **Module Not Found Errors**: The application frequently failed to deploy due to "cannot find a module" errors, indicating that required packages were not being downloaded or recognized by the build process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
*   **Type Issues and Unused Files**: The build process also encountered "type issue" errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. It was observed that [[introduction_to_boltnew | Boltnew]] sometimes installed unnecessary files and dependencies, which then caused errors during deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

The "deployment part is a little finicky when you have external packages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

## Workflow for Bug Resolution

A common workflow adopted to overcome the bugs in [[introduction_to_boltnew | Boltnew]] involves:
1.  Copying the error message provided by the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
2.  Pasting the error message into the prompt area within [[introduction_to_boltnew | Boltnew]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
3.  Instructing the AI to "fix this error" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
4.  Optionally, providing relevant documentation or examples to guide the AI, as it doesn't "always assume the AI knows everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

This iterative process, though requiring persistence, allows users to navigate the bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]>.

## Future Outlook and Use Cases

Despite the current bugs and deployment challenges, [[introduction_to_boltnew | Boltnew]] shows significant potential. It is expected that these issues will be resolved as the platform matures and possibly receives funding to scale its servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

For non-technical individuals, [[introduction_to_boltnew | Boltnew]] and Replit are considered clear winners over tools like [[comparison_of_bolt_and_other_platforms_like_cursor | Cursor]] because they handle the end-to-end process of building and deploying, relieving users from the complexities of deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. While [[comparison_of_bolt_and_other_platforms_like_cursor | Cursor]] allows more developer control, [[introduction_to_boltnew | Boltnew]] takes "the wheel," making it suitable for quick prototyping and proof-of-concept (POC) development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. The ability to quickly build a working prototype in under 20 minutes, even with some fixes, highlights its value for rapid ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.

Ultimately, users are encouraged to "keep playing with these tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> and "keep updated with the tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>, recognizing that early adoption and consistent engagement will prepare them for when these AI tools become "really, really, really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

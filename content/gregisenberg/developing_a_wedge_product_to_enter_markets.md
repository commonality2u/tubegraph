A "wedge product" is defined as a "get in the door product" for a specific industry in vertical Software as a Service (SaaS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>. While the ultimate goal for a vertical SaaS business is to become an all-in-one solution or the primary "source of record" for an industry, this is not where a company typically begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.

## Characteristics of an Effective Wedge Product

A successful wedge product targets a specific area within an industry that meets certain criteria:
*   **Existing Inefficiencies** The area is currently handled via manual "pen and paper processes" or by "shitty competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **Customer Importance** The function is highly important to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.
*   **Ease of Implementation** The product is easy to implement and deploy quickly, avoiding lengthy, 12-month-long adoption cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
*   **Reputation Prover** It serves as a "reputation prover," allowing the company to build trust and demonstrate value quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. Most companies fail on their wedge product because they don't think about it sufficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.
*   **Trust Builder** The product should aim to build maximum trust with the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.

## Strategic Role of Wedge Products

The strategy behind a wedge product is to gain initial traction and then expand within the customer's operations. It's often easier to sell additional products to an existing customer than to acquire a completely new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.

### Integration with Payments

A crucial step in scaling a vertical SaaS company is to integrate payments into the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. If a wedge product can be built for a function that occurs either before or after a financial transaction, it creates an opportunity to eventually "own the transaction" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>.

By adding payments, vertical SaaS companies can scale incredibly quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. For example, Toast, a restaurant software company, saw its potential market size increase from $120 million (based on software subscriptions for one million U.S. restaurants at $10/month) to trillions of dollars by taking a percentage of the one trillion dollars in revenue processed by those restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>. This demonstrates how owning the transaction significantly expands market opportunity.

## Case Study: Roofer.com

Roofer.com serves the roofing industry, a large market with a healthy mix of small, medium, and large businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. Instead of launching an all-in-one software solution from the outset, Roofer.com began with a "proposal tool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

This tool used Google Maps to generate roof proposals, allowing roofing companies to provide real-time quotes to customers without a physical visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. This free wedge product acquired roofing companies through digital marketing channels like Instagram and Facebook ads, which is typically "unheard of" in sales-heavy home services industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

The product gained rapid adoption because it offered a convenient digital experience for customers and saved roofing companies the effort of sending someone out for an initial quote, with Roofer.com getting paid a percentage upon booking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. After establishing trust and reputation with this initial tool, Roofer.com then expanded its offerings, launching a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, and is expected to move towards an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or an all-in-one solution, following the customer's entire life cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

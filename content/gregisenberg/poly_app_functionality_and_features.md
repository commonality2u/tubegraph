Poly.ai is an AI product designer YC startup that claims to generate beautiful, production-ready designs and front-end code from English language prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is positioned as a tool for non-designers to create production-ready designs and front-end code with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Core Functionality
Poly.ai's interface is similar to a conversational AI like ChatGPT, but specifically for design purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Users can input their desired design through text prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Input Methods
*   **Text Input**: Users can type out descriptions of the designs they wish to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Voice Input**: A microphone feature allows users to record their voice to dictate design ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Image Uploads**: Users can upload images, including hand-drawn wireframes or sketches, to serve as inspiration or direct input for the design generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Design Process
Upon signing up, Poly.ai automatically creates a first project for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Design generation can take some time, typically around a minute or longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. A notable critique is the absence of a progress bar during this generation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Output and Editing
*   **Generated Designs**: Poly.ai aims to produce designs that can include full landing pages and, with further prompting, product interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The designs are saved and accessible on the right-hand side of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Editing Options**: Users can adjust various design parameters such as font, radius, and colors after a design has been created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It also supports light and dark modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Rollback Functionality**: A rollback button is available for users to revert to previous design states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   **Production-ready Code**: The tool claims to produce production-ready code, directly connecting to a user's codebase and working with existing tools like Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

## Pricing Model
Poly.ai operates on a credit-based system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Users receive 250 free credits upon signing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Design generation consumes credits: 50 credits per page and 25 credits per component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## Comparison with V0
Poly.ai is often compared to V0, another well-known product in the [[integrating_ai_features_into_mobile_apps | AI designer space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **User Feedback**: V0 provides conversational feedback during the generation process, making the experience feel more interactive, whereas Poly.ai offers less insight into its thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.
*   **Design Quality**: While both tools can produce impressive designs, the visual aesthetic of V0 is perceived to be slightly nicer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. However, Poly.ai was noted for a strong detail in a graph hover functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.
*   **Speed**: V0 *feels* faster due to its progress updates, but actual generation time might be comparable to Poly.ai's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
*   **Product UI Generation**: Poly.ai successfully generated a product UI for a proposed YouTube analytics tool, including features like AB testing, AI prediction, cumulative engagement charts, and performance comparisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. In a side-by-side test, V0 also produced a similar product interface, but in one instance, it literally copied the image provided for inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

## Limitations and User Experience
*   **Prompt Specificity**: To get the best results, users need to understand specific design terms (e.g., "glass morphism") and trending styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. The tool does not proactively ask clarifying questions to understand user preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
*   **Clickable Demos**: When creating a landing page, Poly.ai did not provide a functional "See Demo" or "Get Started" button that allowed users to interact with the envisioned product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Irrelevant Product Images**: In some instances, the generated product images on a landing page were generic or irrelevant to the specific use case requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

## Overall
Poly.ai is a promising [[integrating_ai_features_into_mobile_apps | AI app development strategies]] tool for generating designs from prompts and code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While it offers powerful features like image input and design editing, users may need to provide very specific prompts using design terminology to achieve desired aesthetic results. The ability to generate functional product interfaces and its seamless connection with existing tools are significant advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

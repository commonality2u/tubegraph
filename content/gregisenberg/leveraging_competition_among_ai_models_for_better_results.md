A strategy has been developed to significantly enhance the output from Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Chat GPT, Grock, Claude, and Gemini, potentially yielding five times better results, copy, and overall output without additional cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This method involves intentionally creating a competitive dynamic among these [[combining_different_ai_tools_for_effective_development | AI models]].

## The "Jealousy" Technique for LLMs

The core principle behind this method is to make the LLMs "jealous of each other" to elicit superior responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Traditionally, users might [[prompting_techniques_for_effective_use_of_ai_models | prompt]] a single [[leveraging_ai_in_existing_business_models | AI]] tool and accept its output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. However, this new approach suggests opening multiple LLMs simultaneously for a given task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Process Overview
1.  **Initial Prompting**: Provide the same initial prompt to several different LLMs (e.g., Chat GPT, Grock, Claude, Gemini) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
2.  **Evaluate and Compare**: Review the responses from each LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
3.  **Introduce Competition**: Critically evaluate one LLM's response, often by claiming another LLM produced a superior result, even if it requires a slight exaggeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
4.  **Iterate for Improvement**: Use the "better" output from one LLM as a benchmark or example when prompting another, challenging it to surpass the competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Practical Demonstration: Crafting a Cold Email

The technique was demonstrated by crafting a cold email for an agency named LCA, a design firm specializing in [[leveraging_ai_in_existing_business_models | AI]] interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Example

#### Initial Prompt to Multiple LLMs
The request given to each LLM was: "I want to create a cold email for my agency LCA. LCA is the premier design firm designing [[leveraging_ai_in_existing_business_models | AI]] interfaces. But I want to make it a cold email that will stand out. Can you help me do this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>

#### Grock's Initial Output
Grock produced a template focusing on intuitive [[leveraging_ai_in_existing_business_models | AI]] interfaces, addressing issues like "clunky, outdated designs" and highlighting LCA's specialized expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The output was considered "not bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

#### Chat GPT's Initial Output
Chat GPT's email started with the subject line "Your [[leveraging_ai_in_existing_business_models | AI]] deserves better design" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. It claimed LCA designs interfaces that make people trust [[leveraging_ai_in_existing_business_models | AI]], mentioning companies like Grammarly, Shopify, and Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. While "not bad," the user decided to rate it poorly to instigate competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

#### Pitting Chat GPT Against Grock
Chat GPT was told: "Not bad, but I'm surprised. Grock crushed it and was a nine on 10. Chat GBT was kind of average and was five on 10. I thought you were the better LLM. What's going on? I will share what Grock did as an FYI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Chat GPT's response embraced the challenge, recognizing the user's personal brand and aiming for a "harder," "fresher" email that sounds like an agency people would "brag about hiring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. It delivered a 9.5 out of 10 version, with more engaging language and a focus on making [[leveraging_ai_in_existing_business_models | AI]] "magical, not mechanical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This output was considered a "standing ovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

#### Pitting Claude Against Chat GPT
Claude was then told: "Hey, this is really strange. I asked chat GPT the same prompt and it was like 10x better. Here is what it created. I thought Claude was the Rolls Royce of LLMs, not the Toyota" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

Claude acknowledged the distinct voice of the shared example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. It then provided its own version, demonstrating an understanding of the user's context window and personal identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Conclusion
This "hack" of pitting LLMs against each other has proven to be an effective method for maximizing their output, leading to significantly better results without incurring additional costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. By leveraging a sense of competition, users can push [[combining_different_ai_tools_for_effective_development | AI models]] to refine and improve their responses.

Dan Chipper is incubating several interesting AI startup ideas, many of which revolve around innovative media formats facilitated by artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. He emphasizes that new technologies create opportunities for new media formats, much like the internet enabled YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. AI significantly reduces the cost of storytelling, allowing stories to be told in places where it was previously too expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Interactive Voice-First Media
A core theme in new AI media formats is the concept of "media that you talk to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This represents a shift towards two-way interactions with content.

### Advanced Voice Notes
One proposed idea is "advanced voice notes," which builds on ChatGPT's voice mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The concept allows a user to:
*   Have a conversation with AI to think through an issue, such as a business or strategy problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   Send a summary of that conversation to colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   Allow recipients to receive a text summary and then "talk to the transcript" of the original conversation with the AI to get deeper context and reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This reduces repetitive questions and provides richer context for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Interactive Podcasts and Meeting Summaries
An internal project, "tldr," exemplifies this interactive media approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   It takes meeting recordings and converts them into short, three-minute podcasts that summarize key takeaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   A prototype allows users to interrupt the podcast and have a conversational interaction with the AI host for clarification or more details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   This fulfills a human desire for direct interaction, much like a podcast host "coming out of the wall" to become a real person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

The rise of voice-first interfaces, particularly among younger generations who are accustomed to interacting with devices like Apple Watches and advanced voice modes, suggests a potential return to an "oral culture" where interaction with computers is primarily by voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. This opens up opportunities for voice-first versions of existing services, such as Expedia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

## AI-Powered Personalized Content
AI enables the creation of highly personalized content and experiences.

### "N of One" for Personal Data Analysis
The idea of "N of One" is a platform for individuals or businesses to post their own datasets and offer bounties for data scientists (or anyone with AI tools) to find useful predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   Inspired by Kaggle, a marketplace for data scientists, but reimagined for a time when "everyone's a data scientist" due to AI tools like GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   An example given is using personal biometric data (e.g., Whoop data, voice, facial movement) to predict when an individual might experience OCD symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   This represents a new way of doing science, focusing on predictive models for individuals ("n of one") rather than generalized explanations from large studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   Public datasets available on platforms like Kaggle, ranging from "avocado prices to video game sales," offer a "gold mine for coming up with startup ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. A simple startup idea could be "database as a service" (DaaS), curating data and selling access to social audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

### AI-Tailored "Great Books"
AI can make classic literature more accessible and engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   The "Great Books" (e.g., Marcus Aurelius, Plato, Moby Dick) are socially aspirational but often difficult to read in traditional translations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
*   AI can create new versions and translations of these public-domain books, tailored for specific audiences (e.g., a 30-something English-speaking tech enthusiast) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   These can be presented in multimodal formats, including audio, video (potentially [[utilizing_ai_tools_for_script_and_video_production | AI-generated movies]]), and even interactive advanced voice mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   This targets students (as a modern alternative to SparkNotes or CliffsNotes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, and intellectual/business professionals who aspire to familiarity with the Western Canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   Monetization could involve one-off access, subscriptions, or creating luxurious physical versions with digital companions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. This aligns with the idea that as technology makes things cheaper (like books via printing press), the original form can become a luxury status good (like Broadway plays after TV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

## Distribution Strategies for AI Apps
For those [[developing_content_strategies and using_ai_for_content_creation | building AI apps]], effective distribution is key:
*   **Audience-First Approach**: Build a media business and engaged audience first, then launch products to them. This can yield immediate traction (hundreds to thousands of users on day one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.
*   **Building for Self**: Create products that solve your own problems, as this tends to attract similar audiences who will also want the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. The current AI wave "resets the playing field," offering low-hanging fruit for such self-serving development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.
*   **Modern Media Channels**: While newsletters were effective in the past, starting with YouTube is a recommended strategy for 2025, funneling viewers into a newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.
*   **User Segmentation**: Utilize tools like ConvertKit to segment subscribers based on their origin (e.g., specific YouTube videos) to send targeted invitations and gain feedback from the right initial users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.

Large companies are often limited in the risk they can take to integrate new AI paradigms without alienating existing users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>. This creates a "tremendous advantage for startups" to figure out the future of AI interfaces and target early adopters, eventually expanding to the mass market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

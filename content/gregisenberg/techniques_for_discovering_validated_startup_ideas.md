The process of discovering validated startup ideas involves leveraging community discussions on platforms like Reddit and utilizing AI tools to identify needs and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This method has been used to build multi-million dollar businesses by finding ideas that resonate with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The goal is to find ideas that are already "validated" by user interest and expressed needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Four-Step Process to Find Validated Startup Ideas

This methodology uses a specific tool, Gummy Search, to uncover trending communities and their pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Step 1: Finding Trending Subreddits

The initial step involves identifying rapidly growing communities on Reddit that represent potential markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

*   **Utilize Gummy Search:** Begin by navigating to the "trending" section within Gummy Search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Filter by Growth:** Focus on subreddits sorted by their daily, weekly, or monthly growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Target Mid-Sized Communities:** Instead of focusing on massive subreddits, concentrate on those with 10,000 to 100,000 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. These communities are typically newer, trending, and highly relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Self-Assessment:** As you scroll through potential subreddits, ask yourself: Is this interesting? Do I possess an "unfair advantage" or expertise in this area? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
*   **Document Ideas:** Keep a running list of interesting subreddits in a notebook or Google Doc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Regular Check-ins:** Revisit Gummy Search every few weeks to stay updated on new trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Step 2: Identifying Problems and Solutions within Subreddits

Once a promising subreddit is identified, the next phase is to delve into the specific problems users face and any proposed solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Gummy Search can categorize discussions to facilitate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

*   **Create an Audience:** In Gummy Search, create an "audience" based on the chosen subreddit, including similar communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. For example, an audience named "people into dog food" could include various dog-related subreddits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Analyze "Pain and Anger":** This section highlights common user frustrations and issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Gummy Search uses AI to summarize patterns from thousands of words of submissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    *   *Example:* In a dog food community, patterns might reveal "potty training challenges," "dogs reluctant to walk outside," or "eating habits/loss of appetite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. These directly suggest potential product or content ideas (e.g., a service for potty training, a website for stubborn dogs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Review "Advice Requests":** This category shows what people are actively asking for, indicating unmet needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. These are "people screaming they want these products to exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Users might ask for dog breed recommendations (leading to an idea for a survey-based dog breed matching website) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> or dog food recommendations for specific issues like old age (suggesting a soft food product for senior dogs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Examine "Solution Requests":** This section provides insight into existing solutions people use and the competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This helps understand how people currently address their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Document Ideas:** Continuously write down potential startup ideas and initial competitive analyses in your Google Doc, forming a one-pager for each business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Step 3: Identifying Influencers and Their Audience Needs

After identifying problems and potential solutions, the next step is to find key influencers in the niche and analyze their content and audience engagement to gain deeper insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

*   **Find Creators:** Use an AI tool like Perplexity.ai (or similar) to find popular influencers related to your chosen niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. For example, "25 most popular dog influencers on YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Analyze Popular Content:** Visit the creators' channels (e.g., YouTube) and sort their videos by "most popular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   **Read Audience Comments:** Read through the comments on popular videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This provides direct insights into what the audience is thinking, what they want, and their specific needs and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Document Learnings:** Add these insights to your one-pager document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Step 4: Wireframing and Naming the Idea

The final step involves translating the gathered insights into a tangible (even if preliminary) business concept.

*   **Wireframe the Website/Product:** Create a basic wireframe or mock-up of what the product or service would look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This can be done quickly using tools like Framer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
    *   *Example:* If users are frustrated with designers who don't prioritize conversion, a wireframe for a "design agency that cared about copy and conversion" could be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Develop a Catchy, Validated Name:** Consider naming the company after the subreddit itself or a common phrase found within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. The name should resonate with the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
    *   *Example:* The insight that people wished designers were "more like a scientist, less art, more science" led to the name "Design Science.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, which became a seven-figure business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

## Creating Content That Resonates

The same principles used for [[brainstorming_startup_ideas | brainstorming startup ideas]] can be applied to generating content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

*   **Identify Top Content:** Within Gummy Search, go to the "top content" section for your chosen audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Analyze Patterns and Formats:** Observe the common patterns in high-performing content and the types of formats that work best (e.g., long stories, memes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
    *   *Example:* In a dog community, popular content might include stories like "loss of a beloved pet" or "today I saved a dog's life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.
*   **Ask Gummy Search Questions:** Use Gummy Search as an "entrepreneurial assistant" to ask specific questions about content preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. For instance, "do they love memes?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

This approach allows entrepreneurs to "teleport to different communities" and observe their needs, leading to validated ideas for both products and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

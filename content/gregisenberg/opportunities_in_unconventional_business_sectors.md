Many highly successful and wealthy individuals have built their fortunes not through high-tech, venture-backed startups, but through "boring, sweaty businesses" [00:00:02]. These are typically service-based companies that involve physical work, often overlooked by those aspiring to be tech entrepreneurs [00:01:32]. Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," highlights the significant [[Antitrends and opportunities in startup culture | opportunities in these unconventional sectors]] [00:01:00].

## The Appeal of "Boring" Businesses

Wealthy people often derive their success from mundane sectors such as underground utilities, surveying, HVAC, and real estate development [00:00:25]. If the goal is to increase the odds of achieving significant wealth, focusing on normal, boring businesses can be more effective than pursuing trendy tech ventures [00:02:02].

In contrast to the high failure rate of tech and AI startups, these "boring" businesses often have less sophisticated competition [00:24:06]. Instead of competing against highly funded, brilliant computer science graduates, one might be competing against businesses that still use fax machines and don't answer their phones [00:24:40]. This significantly increases the odds of success and profitability [00:25:16].

## Case Study: Nick Huber's Journey

### Storage Squad: Pickup and Delivery Storage

Nick Huber's first successful "sweaty startup" was Storage Squad, a pickup and delivery storage business for college students [00:02:17]. Students would store their boxes in a warehouse over the summer, and the company would return them to their new residences [00:02:26].

*   **Revenue and Profit**: At its peak, Storage Squad generated approximately $2.2 million in annual revenue, with a profit of $400,000 to $500,000 per year [00:02:34].
*   **Marketing**: The primary marketing strategy was simple and low-cost: sidewalk chalk [00:02:48]. Ads with the website and price ($29.99 per box all summer) were written thousands of times in areas frequented by students [00:03:21].
*   **Bootstrapping**: The business was bootstrapped, starting with a $1,500 cargo van bought on Craigslist and a $2,200 box truck [00:03:44].
*   **Origin**: The idea originated when someone inquired about storing their belongings in Nick's apartment instead of leasing it, leading him to realize the demand for storage [00:04:44].
*   **Sale**: The business was sold in 2020 for $1.75 million with no debt [00:04:22].

### Self-Storage Facilities

Leveraging the success of Storage Squad, Nick and his partner transitioned into building and acquiring self-storage facilities [00:02:42].

*   **First Acquisition**: In 2019, they bought a self-storage facility in Erie, Pennsylvania, for $625,000 at a public auction [00:05:30]. It had over 40,000 square feet and 180 units, generating only $4,000 a month due to neglect and over a hundred abandoned units [00:05:37].
*   **Second Acquisition**: A self-storage facility in North Georgia was purchased for $1.5 million [00:06:09]. When acquired, it generated $15,600 to $16,000 a month in revenue; today, it generates $40,000 a month and is valued at $4.5 million [00:06:18]. This significant increase in value was achieved without spectacular inventions or raising money [00:06:22].

## Examples of "Sweaty Startups" with High Profit Potential

These businesses don't require extensive capital or complex technology, often relying on simple marketing and consistent service.

*   **Lawn Care**: Nick's brother runs a lawn care company using bandit signs as his sole marketing method [00:07:32]. He acquires 30-40 new customers annually, leading to 30% growth and over $100,000 in profit while working only nine months a year [00:07:42].
*   **Mobile Detailing**: One entrepreneur made $10,000 profit on $17,000 revenue in a single month from a mobile detailing business, equating to $120,000 annually just one year out of college [00:08:06].
*   **High-End Transportation**: A friend operates a high-end airport transportation service with multiple drivers in Atlanta, doing "really well" [00:08:18].
*   **Firewood Delivery with Onsite Racks**: A unique service involving building firewood racks on-site (costing ~\$100 in materials and 1.5 hours) and delivering seasoned firewood. This could command $800-\$1,000 per delivery, allowing for $1,000 profit in a day (over $100/hour) [00:08:44]. This could also be a recurring subscription service [00:09:31] and an entry point to offer other services like lawn mowing, snow clearing, or tree work [00:09:47].
*   **Local Bar TV Advertising**: An individual in North Georgia charges $10 a month to advertise businesses on rotating TV screens in 70 bars and restaurants, netting $20,000 a month [00:10:11]. This fosters local business loyalty to the bars [00:11:09].
*   **Putting Green Installation**: A higher-skilled service that can generate $30,000 to $200,000 per high-end turf installation at residential properties [00:11:40].
*   **Tree Removal**: Despite risks and high equipment costs, two workers can earn over $3,000 for four hours of work removing two trees [00:11:54].
*   **Christmas Light Installation**: While risky due to heights, individuals pay "absurd amounts of money," such as $3,500 to $4,000 for a few rows of lights installed for three months [00:12:17].
*   **Power Washing**: A low-skill, low-capital entry point for cleaning concrete, furniture, and decks [00:12:54].
*   **Concrete Work**: Installation of driveways, slabs, and patios [00:13:04].
*   **Bounce House Rentals**: A simple rental business [00:13:08].

## Sweaty Digital Business: Nanny/Night Nurse Recruiting

A significant [[Opportunities in niche markets and customized solutions | niche opportunity]] identified is a local nanny recruiting company, specifically for night nurses [00:13:22].

*   **The Problem**: Finding a qualified nanny or night nurse is time-consuming, involving job postings, screening calls, background checks, and interviews [00:13:25].
*   **The Solution**: A service that handles these steps for a fee of $3,000 to $5,000 [00:13:40].
*   **Nightnurses.com**: The domain `nightnurses.com` was available for $13,000, or $1,100 a month for 13 months, making it accessible even without upfront capital [00:16:23].
*   **Leveraging the Digital Asset**:
    *   Building a directory, potentially with [[Business opportunities using AI in niche markets | AI to build the directory]] [00:16:51].
    *   Generating organic traffic through blogs and product reviews [00:16:54].
    *   Advertising on popular pregnancy apps [00:17:05].
    *   Providing an entry point to sell other services (nanny recruiting, home outfitting for babies) and affiliate products [00:17:23].
*   **Hybrid Approach**: Starting with a "sweaty" service — personally vetting and placing night nurses for a one-time fee of $1,000 — and then scaling with remote recruiters and potentially integrating [[Business opportunities with AI | AI for broader services]] like payroll [00:27:11]. This illustrates how [[Challenges and opportunities in the CPG and software sectors | software]] and [[High opportunity niches in SaaS apps | SaaS]] elements can later be built upon a robust, "sweaty" foundation.

### The Value of a Strong Domain Name

Investing in a premium `.com` domain name is seen as crucial for a digital business, analogous to investing in prime real estate for a physical business [00:20:01]. A good domain like `nightnurses.com` can significantly boost organic traffic and lead generation, quickly offsetting its cost [00:20:23]. Large language models (LLMs) are also expected to prioritize `.com` domains over other extensions [00:20:14].

## AI as a Tool, Not Always the Business

While [[Business opportunities with AI | AI startups]] are prevalent, many are unlikely to achieve profitability [00:23:45]. The success rate of AI startups is comparable to that of other tech startups, with a vast majority failing [00:23:51].

Instead of focusing on building an AI company, entrepreneurs should view AI as a tool that can make existing "sweaty startups" more efficient and profitable [00:29:57]. Just as the lawnmower made lawn care companies more efficient, AI can enable businesses to do more with less labor, increasing their overall profitability [00:28:40].

## Further Resources

Nick Huber's website, `sweatystartup.com`, features a page with over 400 "sweaty startup" ideas, primarily focused on cleaning, moving, repairing, or providing physical services [00:29:21]. Most of these businesses can be bootstrapped [00:29:33]. He also has a book titled "The Sweaty Startup: How to Get Rich Doing Boring Things," which covers picking and vetting ideas, assessing demand, hiring, delegating, selling, and decision-making [00:29:47].

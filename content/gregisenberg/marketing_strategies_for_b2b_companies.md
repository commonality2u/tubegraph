The traditional marketing funnel is considered an "entirely wrong way to think about marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Instead, modern marketing should embrace the concept of "digital gravity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Digital Gravity: A New Marketing Paradigm
The "digital gravity" model suggests that people don't follow a linear path to purchase; they interact with a brand, disengage, get "sucked back in," perform "three rotations around it," and then "finally touch down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This model focuses on building digital mass on the internet, which translates to influence within a niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:03">[02:03:03]</a>.

This digital mass is built through:
*   Content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>
*   Marketing across all platforms where customers are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>

The larger the digital mass, the more people are drawn into the brand's orbit, leading to more "touchdowns" (conversions or revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This revenue can then be reinvested into growth, creating a "growth flywheel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

### Continuous Marketing
Marketing should be a continuous process, not a series of isolated "campaigns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. The term "campaign" originated from military actions that had a start and an end point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Modern marketing, like building a website or app, is a "living and breathing entity" that is continuously evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:35]</a>.

### Resource Allocation for Startups
*   **Funded Startups:** Have ample money, time, and resources, allowing them to market "everywhere" their audience is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapped Startups:** Typically have more time and mental energy, but less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

## Tactical B2B Growth Framework
This framework aims to make a B2B company "famous in 12 months to the target audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a> and involves layering multiple growth curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

### 1. Identify and Target the Audience
*   **Target Audience:** Often a smaller group, sometimes around 50,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
*   **Email Scraping:** Collect emails of the target audience using tools like Apollo.io or LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. Apollo.io, for example, can extract 10,000 emails for about $99/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.

### 2. Run Paid Advertising (Always On)
*   **Custom Match Lists:** Import scraped emails into platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads to create custom audience lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. Facebook typically matches 30-40% of emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.
*   **UGC/AI Avatar Ads:** Use User-Generated Content (UGC) or AI-generated avatar ads to address audience pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Tools:** HeyGen for avatars, ElevenLabs for voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
    *   **Founder's Presence:** The founder can create a digital clone of themselves to appear in ads, which helps build their personal brand and leverage for future fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. People buy from people, not brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.
    *   **Ad Variations:** Create 100+ variations with different hooks, settings, backgrounds, and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. Allocate 80% of the budget to the best-performing ads (lowest CPC) and 20% to continuous testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Storytelling:** Ads should follow a "Hero's Journey" cycle: problem, discovery journey, solution, improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Content-like Ads:** The goal is to create ads that feel like native content on the platform rather than obvious advertisements, which leads to lower costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:00]</a>.

### 3. Implement Cold Email Outreach
*   **Email Sending Tools:** Use tools like MailReef (for dedicated cold email servers, e.g., 50,000 emails for ~$400/month) combined with SmartLead or Instantly.AI (for managing multiple email accounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.
*   **Domain Isolation:** Use separate domains for transactional emails (core app domain), newsletter emails, and cold emails to prevent a compromised cold email domain from affecting critical product communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.
*   **Email Content:** Similar to ads, focus on problem-solution orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.
*   **Persistence:** Do not be afraid of "burning" an audience; people don't care about your brand enough to be easily alienated unless you're outright spamming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>. Cold email 100% works when done right, often when messaging is specific to the audience's pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.

### 4. Build a Media Company (Podcast & Content)
*   **Content Strategy:** Record customer conversations to understand pain points and turn them into podcast episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>.
*   **Podcast Distribution:** Send podcast episodes out weekly to the scraped email list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>. Tools like MailerLite and Beehiiv can be used for email sequencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage for Deals:** A popular podcast can become a leverage point for negotiating better deals with industry partners, as it creates owned media for ad placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:11]</a>. (e.g., Rupa Health podcast helped negotiate fees with lab companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>).
*   **Monetization:** Turn the media arm into a profit center by selling ad placements on the podcast and in newsletters to relevant companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>. (e.g., Rupa Health subsidized its growth team costs through sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>). This creates a "negative CAC" (Customer Acquisition Cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>.
*   **Content Repurposing:**
    *   **Tools:** Software like Swell AI can transcribe podcasts, extract pain points, generate clips, show notes, and media assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Derivatives:** Turn podcast transcripts into blog posts, white papers, and short-form video clips (shorts) for platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:58:00">[27:58:00]</a>.
*   **Social Media Growth:**
    *   **LinkedIn:** Publish short-form content (e.g., TikTok/Instagram Reels) on LinkedIn; it often goes viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:00">[28:57:00]</a>.
    *   **Instagram:** Run "Instagram-only ads" with a call to action in the caption to "follow this account for more content like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:22:00">[29:22:00]</a>. This can acquire followers for as little as 30 cents per piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>. The goal is to gain free impressions from a larger follower base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:18:00">[30:18:00]</a>.
*   **Podcast as a Lead Driver:** Long-form content, like podcasts, builds significant trust and can be a primary driver of inbound leads, as listeners spend hours asynchronously with the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:18:00">[35:18:00]</a>. This establishes "mental real estate" in the audience's mind, making it hard for competitors to dislodge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>.

### The Combined Effect
After 12 months, this integrated approach results in:
*   Massive ad remarketing to website visitors and target customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:00">[31:18:00]</a>.
*   A weekly email list send to all target customers via the podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:27:00">[31:27:00]</a>.
*   Better deals negotiated due to owned media leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:00">[31:35:00]</a>.
*   Daily posting across all social media channels, consistently appearing in the customer's feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>.

This multi-faceted approach, though "grindy," is how companies achieve exponential growth and significantly increase revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:13:00">[32:13:00]</a>.

This article explores a detailed workflow for [[building_automated_businesses_with_ai | building automated businesses with AI]] and [[building_a_saas_app_using_ai | building a SaaS app using AI]], focusing on creating and utilizing AI-generated avatars and content. The process emphasizes a shift from traditional business models to lean, AI-first approaches that can generate revenue and cash flow with minimal overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## The Paradigm Shift: Traditional vs. AI-First Business
Omar highlights a significant transition in business, driven by COVID-19 and the advent of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Traditional Business Playbook
*   **Product:** Required significant VC capital, years to launch, and hiring expensive software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Product cycles were often dragged out, leading to high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Marketing:** Needed substantial social media budgets, creative teams, professional advertising, or agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Marketing was characterized by seasonal, big campaigns focused on momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Operations:** Focused on hiring talent for productivity, requiring physical office spaces, and leading to higher costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### The New AI-First Paradigm
*   **Product (Technical Shift):** Products can be built instantly at low cost with zero employees, eliminating the need for traditional engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Marketing (Audience Shift):** Emphasizes "solopreneurs" who gain traction through transparency, sharing their financial success and daily stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This fosters "always-on marketing" rather than periodic campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Operations (Cultural Shift):** Remote working is prevalent, allowing access to global talent and reducing office costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Businesses can build faster with fewer people, operating in a much leaner fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Sequential Prompting: A Key Technique
Omar introduces "sequential prompting" as a third way to use AI tools, alongside conversational prompting and master prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
Sequential prompting involves using one AI tool (like ChatGPT) to generate a prompt, then taking that prompt to another AI tool (like Leonardo AI) to generate a different output, and continuing this process across multiple tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This approach allows for the creation of complex outputs by stitching together various AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. It is recommended to start this process manually to allow for rapid iteration and feedback, then automate it once the workflow is solidified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Building an AI Avatar and Content Workflow

### Step 1: Character Creation and Prompt Generation with ChatGPT
This is the starting point for [[using_ai_for_startup_idea_generation | creating compelling stories]] and content with AI characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
1.  **Provide Image Reference:** Upload an image of a person (e.g., a child or yourself) to ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
2.  **Define Basic Attributes:** Give the character a name, age, and gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
3.  **Use a Specific Prompt Structure:** Employ a structured prompt that instructs ChatGPT to analyze the image and describe the person, including details like hairstyle, skin tone, accessories, and outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
4.  **Generate a Consistent Prompt:** ChatGPT will then generate a detailed prompt description of the character, which serves as a consistent reference for future content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This ensures the character remains consistent across different scenes or stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. This prompt can be programmatically sent to other tools via API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

### Step 2: Image Generation with Leonardo AI
The prompt generated by ChatGPT is then used in an image generation tool.
1.  **Input Prompt:** Copy the detailed character description from ChatGPT and paste it into Leonardo AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
2.  **Adjust Settings:** Turn off "Prompt Enhance" and set the aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9 for widescreen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.
3.  **Generate Image:** Leonardo AI quickly generates high-resolution, Pixar-style images of the character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. Leonardo AI also has an API, allowing for programmatic image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
    *   **Example Output:** Omar showcased a story featuring an AI-generated version of Greg, demonstrating how these images can be used to tell engaging narratives for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Step 3: Image Animation with Cling AI
Cling AI allows for turning static images into dynamic videos.
1.  **Upload Image:** Take the generated image from Leonardo AI and upload it to Cling AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
2.  **Add Prompts (Optional):** Users can add additional prompts to dictate specific actions or movements within the scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.
3.  **Generate Video:** Cling AI animates the image into a video clip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>.
4.  **Lip-Sync Feature:** Cling AI also has a feature to dub words and lip-sync the character's mouth to the audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
    *   *Note:* As of the transcript, 5-second video clips take approximately four minutes to generate, which may not be scalable for real-time video offerings but could work for premium or manual services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.

### Step 4: Background Removal with Remove.bg (for physical products)
To prepare images for physical products like stickers, background removal is essential.
1.  **Download Image:** Save the desired image from Leonardo AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.
2.  **Upload to Remove.bg:** Use Remove.bg to automatically remove the image background, creating a clean PNG sticker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
3.  **Automate:** Remove.bg has an API to integrate this step programmatically into the workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.

### Step 5: Physical Product Fulfillment with Printful
Once the digital assets are prepared, they can be turned into physical products.
1.  **Integrate with Printful:** Printful offers an API that allows for programmatic ordering and fulfillment of products like stickers, clothing, and t-shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
2.  **Automate Order Process:** By connecting to Printful's API, businesses can set up an automated workflow where customers upload an image, create custom products, and have them fulfilled automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>. This can be integrated with e-commerce platforms like Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>.

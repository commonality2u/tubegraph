[[Using AI tools for content creation and marketing | AI tools]] like ChatGPT 4o are revolutionizing ad creation, allowing businesses to generate winning ads quickly and efficiently. This can lead to increased return on ad spend (ROAS) and improved business profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. ChatGPT 4o, specifically its image model, is proving to be world-class at creating winning ads, memes, and visual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It can generate ads ready for an ad account in about two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## How ChatGPT 4o Works for Ads

Unlike pure image models like Midjourney or Ideogram, ChatGPT 4o is a multimodal language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This means prompting is less critical, and it has a better understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Key Elements for Effective Ad Creation

The most important elements for creating good ads are the inspiration images and product images you provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

*   **Inspiration Ads**: Provide an existing ad you want to adjust or use as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Product Images**: Supply your own custom product images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

For instance, a simple prompt like "Add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" can yield excellent results, as ChatGPT 4o intelligently understands intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### When to Use Reference Images

ChatGPT 4o has a strong understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. If your product is new, relatively small, or lacks significant online presence (millions in ad spend), you should always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. For well-known brands, a simple text prompt is often sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Prompting Techniques for Quality Output

*   **Photo Realism**: Use keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to prevent cartoonish or strangely colored images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Detailed Descriptions**: A strong, detailed prose description of the desired image is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Font and Style**: For well-known fonts (e.g., "exo2 bold italic"), ChatGPT 4o can interpret these due to its vast internet content exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Users can also specify color styles and aspect ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Generate Image Command**: To avoid the AI generating text that *describes* the ad instead of the ad itself, explicitly prompt "generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### Experimentation at Scale

The goal of ad creation is conversion, which is achieved through experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. [[Automating content creation with AI | AI allows for experimentation]] at scale, quickly generating variations (e.g., different demographics, poses, hair colors) to see what converts best for various audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This means finding the right ad for specific targeting can be done rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. When the API becomes generally available, creating hundreds of personalized ads will be trivial, ready in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Leveraging Trends and Moments

[[Using AI for business automation | AI]] enables companies to capitalize on short new-cycle moments or niche holidays for ad creation, which was previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. AI can be set up to monitor news feeds and instantly produce relevant ads on a mass scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This means ad targeting can become much more personal, funny, and entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

## Optimizing the Workflow

*   **Start a New Chat for Adjustments**: If an initial prompt doesn't yield desired results, it's generally better to start a new chat and adjust the prompt there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Continuing in the same conversation often leads to worse results because the AI uses its own generated (and potentially flawed) image as a reference for subsequent iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Ad Inspiration Sources**: Platforms like Creative OS, ForPlay, and Icon.me provide ad inspiration and templating tools. They read and tag Meta's ad library, making it easily searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **Sora for Ideation**: Sora (which uses the same underlying model as ChatGPT 4o) has an "explore page" where users can see how others are prompting and view the prompts used for any image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. It's a valuable resource for understanding effective prompts and getting creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Sora also allows remixing images, adjusting prompts, changing aspect ratios, and uploading reference images for edits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Live Example: Creating an Ad for LCA

To demonstrate, an ad was created for LCA (Late Checkout Agency), a design agency for the AI age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

1.  **Gathering Brand Assets**: Screenshots were taken from LCA's website, including the logo, typography, and images of brands they work with (Dropbox, Salesforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
2.  **Choosing an Inspiration Ad**: A vintage Rolex ad was chosen for its "luxury vibe" and aesthetic, despite the desire for a "futuristic" look for an AI-focused agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
3.  **Initial Prompting**: The prompt included the gathered screenshots, described LCA as a "SWAT team design agency" for "the most interesting brands on the planet" helping with "building AI-first products," and instructed the AI to use the Rolex ad to capture a "luxury vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.
4.  **First Output and Refinement**: The initial ad successfully captured the luxury aesthetic and included relevant copy, but generated a watch and a man pointing, rather than using the provided company logos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
    *   To refine, a **new chat was started** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.
    *   The prompt was adjusted to specify: "rather than generating a watch show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
    *   This refined prompt yielded an ad with LCA's logo, subheading, and a display of the companies they work with (though it did include Disney, which LCA doesn't work with) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.
5.  **Controlling Output**: AI models like ChatGPT 4o have a low "temperature," meaning similar prompts tend to produce similar results, allowing for consistent iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.
    *   Users can specify dimensions (e.g., 9x16, 1x1) for different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.
    *   While not extensively explored, generated images can be animated or turned into video content using other tools like Runway or Sora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.

This process demonstrates how [[Creating and optimizing marketing content using AI | AI can create unique, targeted, and entertaining ads]] in a short amount of time, allowing for creative exploration and rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.

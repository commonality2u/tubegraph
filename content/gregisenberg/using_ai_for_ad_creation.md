[[the_role_of_ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] has revolutionized the creation of advertisements, enabling businesses to produce a vast number of ad creatives efficiently and cost-effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>. This capability helps apps scale their marketing efforts significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

## The Need for Scale in Advertising

To find profitable ad campaigns, it is crucial to test hundreds, if not thousands, of ad creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. In the past, only large gaming studios, such as Candy Crush or King, could afford to test thousands of ads due to the cost and effort involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>. However, [[using_ai_and_automation_in_marketing | AI]] now makes this strategy accessible to more businesses, including mobile app developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.

## How AI Facilitates Ad Creation

[[using_ai_for_content_creation | AI]] allows for the creation of ads directly from a computer, removing the need to hire actors or extensive production teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>. This significantly reduces costs and speeds up the creative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.

### The Process with AI Tools

Tools like Arcads (a company created by Romain) simplify ad creation into a few steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>:
1.  **Script Writing:** Users write their ad script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.
2.  **Actor Selection:** Users choose from a library of hundreds of virtual actors, representing various situations, ages, and demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. For example, for a calorie tracking app, one could select actors in a gym setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>.
3.  **Video Generation:** The tool generates the video that matches the script and selected actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.

### Benefits of AI in Ad Creation
*   **Speed and Iteration:** Users can generate 20 different ad angles in as little as an hour, allowing for rapid testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.
*   **Ease of Editing:** AI tools can easily remove backgrounds and add screenshots of the app with a single click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** The ability to create numerous ads without costly traditional production methods makes experimentation financially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.

## Localizing and [[targeting_specific_audiences_with_aigenerated_ads | Targeting Specific Audiences]] with AI

[[future_of_digital_advertising_using_ai_technology | AI]] also enables the localization of ads for different countries and languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. Once an ad performs well in an initial market like the US, it can be easily translated and adapted for other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

For instance, a Turkish studio generates $8 million in monthly revenue across numerous apps, including phone cleaners and AI art generators, by using AI to create and localize thousands of ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>. This strategy allows them to iterate on ad angles and languages, extending their reach to various markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.

AI also allows for highly specific [[targeting_specific_audiences_with_aigenerated_ads | targeting specific audiences]] through ads. For example, an ad could be tailored specifically for "Carmel Catholic High School," asking, "Hey, you are Carl Catholic High School? Did you hear about these new things that's happening?" This level of niche targeting is difficult to scale without [[using_ai_for_graphic_design_and_branding | AI]] due to the need for localized content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

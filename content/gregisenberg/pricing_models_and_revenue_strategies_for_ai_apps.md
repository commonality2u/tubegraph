Zach Yagari, a 17-year-old, built an AI startup called Cal AI that generates over $1 million a month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He shares insights into how to build, design, grow, and [[pricing_and_monetization_strategies_for_ai_businesses | price]] an AI app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Key Considerations for AI App Monetization

### Business Model: Dr. AI (Example)
The proposed "Dr. AI" app focuses on health-related AI applications, with features like skin scan diagnosis, a symptom quiz, and a chatbot for general questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. While not a "GPT wrapper," it's an app that can be quickly built and launched into a full business within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The app's purpose is to help users determine if they should seek professional medical attention or if their condition can be safely waited out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

A key aspect of building a product is creating an investment in the product for the user, such as providing a history feature. This encourages users to stick with the app even if a competitor emerges, as all their past data is stored within Dr. AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### [[marketing_strategies_for_ai_applications | Marketing]] and User Acquisition Impact on Revenue
When considering an app's design, it's important to think about the [[growth_marketing_strategies_for_ai_startups | marketing]] side, particularly for influencer campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. The app needs to be simple and clear enough for a viewer to immediately understand its value within a short video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Key "wow factors," such as the skin scan and diagnosis feature in Dr. AI, should be prominently displayed in promotional content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. Branding, including the app name, should be visible on crucial screens that influencers are likely to feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

For utility apps like Dr. AI, shareability among users may be low, as people might not want to share pictures of medical concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. However, word-of-mouth [[user_acquisition_and_marketing_strategies_for_ai_products | marketing]] could occur among specific groups, such as concerned parents recommending the app to friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. The primary drivers for downloads are likely to be [[marketing_strategies_for_ai_applications | paid ads]] or [[marketing_strategies_for_ai_applications | influencer marketing]], often playing on emotions like fear related to potential health problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

When working with influencers, it's crucial to analyze their audience rather than just their niche to ensure alignment with the target demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.

### [[subscription_models_and_pricing_strategies | Pricing Strategies]]
For an app like Dr. AI, a [[subscription_models_and_pricing_strategies | weekly pricing]] model is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. This approach capitalizes on repeat users who may unsubscribe after a single use but resubscribe whenever a new need arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. For example, a user might need the app for a specific skin concern, delete it, and then reinstall it later when another issue arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.

It is recommended to AB test various [[subscription_models_and_pricing_strategies | pricing]] structures to find the optimal point that yields the highest proceeds per download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. Suggested starting points for weekly pricing are $4 or $7, with $4 considered fairer given that it equates to approximately $30 a month if a user remains subscribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. Different durations (weekly, monthly, annually) and the inclusion or exclusion of free trials should be tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>.

## Revenue Measurement
Profitability of influencer posts is determined by ensuring that RPM (Revenue Per Mille/Thousand Views) is greater than CPM (Cost Per Mille/Thousand Views) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. Influencers are typically paid upfront, requiring a prediction of how many views their content will generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. A common approach is to aim for four posts a month from a creator, and initially assume an RPM of $5, then measure actual revenue over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations in Pricing and AI Accuracy
When building AI applications, especially in sensitive areas like health, it is crucial to include clear disclaimers that the information provided is not 100% accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Ensuring the AI's accuracy is paramount to avoid unethical outcomes or negative impacts on users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. Unlike basic GPT wrappers that may offer inaccurate estimations, a robust AI app should employ a sophisticated pipeline of prompts to ensure high accuracy in its results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.

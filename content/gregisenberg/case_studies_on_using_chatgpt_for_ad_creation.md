Creating ads with AI that lead to winning campaigns can significantly increase a business's Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), leading to a more profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach allows for experimentation at scale, enabling marketers to test various creatives and target different audiences efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The "ad is the targeting," and AI facilitates this at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Core Methodology for Ad Creation with AI

The process involves using [[aidriven_innovations_like_chatgpt_40_and_their_applications | ChatGPT 4o]], a new image model, to generate visual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Compared to other image models like [[working_with_midjourney_and_chatgpt_for_design | Midjourney]], Flux, or Ideogram, [[aidriven_innovations_like_chatgpt_40_and_their_applications | ChatGPT 4o]] is a multimodal language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This means prompting is less critical as it has a better understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The most crucial elements for creating effective ads are providing inspiration images and product images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Prompting Techniques

*   **Reference Images for New Products**: If a product is relatively new or has limited online presence (less than millions of dollars in ad spend per month), always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Well-Known Concepts**: For well-known concepts, ideas, or brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge wallets), the model has a strong understanding, so reference images are less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Keywords for Realism**: Using keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" is essential to avoid cartoonish or oddly colored outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Detailed Descriptions**: A strong, detailed prose description of the desired image is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Font and Style Control**: For well-known fonts, the model can decent representations. Users can also adjust color styles and aspect ratios in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **"Generate the Image"**: To avoid the AI generating text descriptions of the ad, specify "generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Clear and Direct Instructions**: Be very clear and direct in what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **New Chat for Adjustments**: If the initial prompt struggles, start a new chat for adjustments instead of continuing in the same conversation. This prevents the model from using a flawed AI-generated image as its new reference, which can lead to worse results over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

### Ad Inspiration and Resources

*   **Sora Explore Page**: The Sora platform, which uses the same underlying model, has an explore page where users can see how others are prompting and get ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Clicking on an image reveals its prompt, which can then be remixed or adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Sora is also noted for having less strict policy guidelines and being better at photo realism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This resource helps in finding aesthetics not yet used in a specific space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Ad Libraries and Tools**: Platforms like Creative OS, ForPlay, and icon.me aggregate and tag ads from sources like Meta's ad library, making it easy to search for inspiration and templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

### 1. Jones Road Beauty (Inspiration + Product Image)

*   **Methodology**: An inspiration ad for Jones Road Beauty was provided, along with a custom product image from their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Prompt**: "Add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: [[aidriven_innovations_like_chatgpt_40_and_their_applications | ChatGPT 4o]] followed instructions precisely, creating an ad with the woman at the top, overlapping products, and text below, demonstrating its intelligence in understanding intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This method allows for creating super consistent and reliable ads by making edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It enables generating varied images (e.g., different demographics) to test conversion for different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### 2. Adidas (No Reference Image, Detailed Prompt)

*   **Methodology**: No specific reference image was used for this well-known brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The prompt relied on a detailed description found on Sora's explore page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Prompt Snippet**: "using the ultra realistic or photo realistic keyword... a female Runner is captured in mid stride running laterally in the for ground wearing her performance gear... behind stands the... the Egyptian desert with the pyramids... font type exo2 bold italic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: The AI generated a very creative ad showing a woman running with the pyramids in the background, shaped like the Adidas logo, demonstrating the capability to create complex, specific visuals without direct image references for known entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### 3. Athletic Greens (Reference Ad + Product Image + Text Adjustment)

*   **Methodology**: An existing Rise ad was used as a reference, combined with Athletic Greens product imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Prompt**: "recreate this ad for ag1 adjust the background to better fit athletic green Style change the price... to $110 SL out to $85 now and then I said generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: The resulting ad was highly effective, accurately incorporating product images, adjusting the background, correctly displaying the price change, and generating appropriate copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This demonstrates AI's ability to remix existing successful ad concepts for new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, a practice already common in the industry through templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

### 4. Ridge Wallet (Changing Concept - Black Friday to Christmas)

*   **Methodology**: A Black Friday ad for Ridge Wallet's gunmetal wallet was used as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Prompt**: The user uploaded an image of a green Ridge wallet and instructed, "swap it out and change it to a Christmas style ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: A Christmas-themed ad for the green Ridge wallet was generated, successfully changing the seasonal concept based on a simple prompt and reference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. This highlights the power of reference images in reducing the need for strict prompting ("a picture's worth a thousand words") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

### 5. Rippling (News Cycle Ad)

*   **Methodology**: To demonstrate capitalizing on current events, an ad was created leveraging a recent controversy involving Rippling and a "spy" deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   **Prompt**: The goal was an "old Wall Street Journal Star Hill newspaper ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: The ad featured a newspaper style with clever, funny copy: "Rippling so good our competitors can't even resist sneaking a peak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. This shows how companies can now take advantage of short news cycle moments quickly and affordably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. AI could potentially watch news feeds and produce mass ads on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

### 6. LCA (Live Demonstration - Luxury Brand Ad)

A live demonstration was conducted to [[how_to_create_ads_using_ai_models_like_chatgpt | create ads with AI]] for LCA, a design agency for the AI age specializing in AI interfaces for large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. The company aims for a luxury, "SWAT team" vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.

*   **Inputs**: Screenshots of the LCA website (logo, typography, client brands like Dropbox, Salesforce) were used, along with a vintage Rolex ad as an inspiration for a luxury feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
*   **Initial Prompt**: "generate a digital ad for LCA... LCA is a SWAT team slash design agency for the most interesting brands on the planet helping them with building AI first products... it only works with the best companies I have provided some screenshots from their website for you to use as inspiration in the ad as well as a reference vintage Rolex ad as inspiration use this to capture the luxury Vibe of the company... generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
*   **First Outcome**: The AI generated an ad with a man pointing, fire in the background, and text "Leaders at billion dollar Brands choose LCA to Define their future." However, it included a watch (an LCA-branded Rolex) from the inspiration image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. The ad had the right vibe, copy, and digital style with a CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. This was considered a "higher risk ad" due to vagueness and relying on AI creativity for a less well-known company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.
*   **Refinement (New Chat)**: To remove the watch and include client logos, a new chat was started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. This is critical because continuing in the same conversation can lead to a "recycle of worse and worse" images as the AI uses its own flawed output as a new reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.
*   **Revised Prompt**: "rather than generating a watch show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.
*   **Second Outcome**: The new ad successfully replaced the watch with client logos (though it included Disney, a company LCA doesn't work with, highlighting occasional hallucination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>). The man was no longer pointing but showing his fist. This demonstrates that while the core elements remain consistent (due to "low temperature" in LLMs leading to similar outputs for similar inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>), specific details can be adjusted with clear prompts.

## Future Implications and Tips

*   **Personalized Targeting**: Ads can become much more personal, funny, and entertaining, driven by the ideas of human creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
*   **API Availability**: When the API for these models becomes generally available, creating hundreds of ads for different audiences in minutes will be trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Video Content**: While direct [[content_generation_using_ai | AI-driven video creation]] from these images is still evolving, users can animate generated ads. Tools like Runway and Sora are recommended for exploring video possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.
*   **Ad Dimensions**: The AI usually defaults to 9x16 aspect ratio, but users can specify dimensions like 1x1 or 9x16 in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.
*   **Iterative Process**: While simple, well-defined prompts can yield one-shot successes, more complex or vague prompts may require two or three iterations to match intent and taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
*   **Directing Creativity**: Once an initial AI-generated ad provides a creative direction, users can then apply more specific prompts to guide it towards exactly what they want (e.g., specifying pointing gestures, exact logo inclusions, text placement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

The current era is an "incredible time to [[how_to_create_ads_using_ai_models_like_chatgpt | create ads with AI]]," memes, and creative content to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

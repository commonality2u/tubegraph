Direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands are beginning to own digital influencers, leveraging AI-generated characters for marketing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. This concept arises from observations of real-world challenges, such as a celebrity partner for a brand getting into public trouble, potentially ruining the brand's affiliation and still requiring payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

## Benefits for Brands
*   **Cost-Effective** Digital influencers are cheaper to create and maintain than human celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
*   **Risk Mitigation** They eliminate the risk of a celebrity partner messing up and ruining the brand's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.
*   **Consistency** Digital characters offer greater consistency, always remaining on-brand and reliably performing as promised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
*   **Owned Asset** Digital influencers become an owned media asset, similar to a YouTube channel or email list, and can be included on a company's balance sheet for their cumulative impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.
*   **Face to a Brand** They provide a distinct "face" to a brand, which can be highly impactful and powerful, similar to how iconic founders like Steve Jobs represent Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.
*   **Entertainment Value** Digital influencers can provide entertainment, creating gossip and drama to generate dialogue around the brand's ecosystem, fostering deeper engagement from audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. People engage with entertainment, and brands can provide this, creating communities around their "lore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

## Creation and Evolution
Initially, agencies may offer digital influencer services to companies. Eventually, it is expected that companies will build internal teams dedicated to developing these networks and communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This shift is seen as inevitable due to the cost-effectiveness and reach effectiveness of this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

### How to Create a Digital Influencer
To create a digital influencer, one could:
1.  Generate a person or license someone's likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
2.  Train a stable diffusion model or other new models (like Flux) based on that person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.
3.  Craft a narrative and lifestyle for the character to live out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
4.  Use AI-powered editing tools (e.g., MockMoi.ai, Canva) and face-swapping technology for consistency across different poses and expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.
5.  As technology advances, these characters can be used for short-form videos, GIFs, and long-form YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

### Community and Lore
Digital influencers can cultivate fan bases through developing elaborate "lore" or backstories, similar to how fantasy worlds engage audiences. This lore generates dialogue and community engagement around the brand, even though the characters are fictional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

## Real-World Examples and Implications
*   **Lil Miquela:** An early example of a digital influencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   **Aitana Lopez:** A fake influencer from Barcelona created by an art collective, who successfully generated significant revenue through OnlyFans by selling images of her in lingerie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. This demonstrates that people will engage with and spend money on fictional characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.
*   **Candy AI:** Another example mentioned, which offers chat with AI "girlfriends" who can send nudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

The trend of digital influencers starts in art and creative collectives, then trickles down to direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands, and eventually into business-to-business (B2B) applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>. Corporations are expected to embrace this for its longevity, consistent branding, and lack of scandal, potentially having the same spokesperson for hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>. The increasing prevalence of digital entertainment suggests people will naturally engage with these characters, often without realizing they are not real until much later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

## Relation to [[using_ai_for_content_generation_and_marketing | AI in Marketing]]
The development and use of digital influencers is a prime example of [[creating_ai_based_branding_content | creating AI-based branding content]] and [[personalized_marketing_with_ai | personalized marketing with AI]] by generating diverse body types and crafting specific narratives for different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. This approach directly challenges traditional influencer marketing, offering a more controlled and cost-effective method for brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

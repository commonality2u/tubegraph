Screen-based services in rideshare vehicles, such as those found in the back of Ubers, present a unique opportunity for monetization beyond traditional display advertising. One existing example is Play Octopus, a company acquired by T-Mobile in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>.

## Current Model: Play Octopus

Play Octopus provides tablets installed on the back of headrests in rideshare vehicles, primarily offering trivia games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>. This service is popular with passengers, creating a "better ride vibe" and a more engaging experience, leading to virtually no churn from drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>.

However, the current [[monetization strategies beyond ads | monetization strategy]] relies on basic display ads shown in between trivia games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. Drivers reportedly earn very little from these tablets, around $70 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>, despite the company itself doing an estimated $8-10 million in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.

## Proposed Monetization Strategies

The existing model has "terrible monetization" despite being a "great product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. New approaches could significantly increase revenue for both the service provider and the drivers.

### 1. Performance-Based Advertising (CPA/CPL)

Instead of simple display ads, a more effective strategy involves Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) ads or Cost Per Lead (CPL) ads combined with QR codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>.

*   **Mechanism:** When a passenger scans a QR code and provides their contact information (phone number or email), an affiliate commission is generated for both the service company and the Uber driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.
*   **Targeting:** This model could target consumers for CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) brands, with typical payouts around $3 for an email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.
*   **Bundling Leads:** Multiple businesses (e.g., a grocery store, a tire shop) could collectively pay for the same lead, increasing the payout per lead to potentially $6-10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.
*   **Incentive:** Passengers could receive something in return for scanning and providing information, such as an e-book or PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>.
*   **Feasibility:** The increased familiarity with QR codes due to the pandemic makes this strategy more viable now than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.

### 2. Driver Incentives and Network Effects

By offering drivers a significantly higher share of revenue (e.g., an extra $500 a month compared to $70), a powerful network effect can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

*   **Referral Programs:** Drivers, often part of online groups, would naturally share their increased earnings, leading to organic adoption of the new service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.
*   **Consumable Products:** Similar to how other businesses thrive on consumable products, this model ensures repeat engagement and potential recurring revenue for drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.
*   **Free Hardware:** Tablets could be provided to drivers for free, making the barrier to entry minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>.

### 3. High-Risk Monetization (Betting/Casino)

A more controversial but potentially highly lucrative approach would involve integrating betting or casino-style games, especially in areas where sports betting is legal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>.

*   **Direct Partnerships:** Partnering with betting companies like FanDuel could offer passengers free betting credits via QR codes, targeting a captive audience, particularly those heading to sports events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>.
*   **Prediction Markets:** Real-time prediction markets (e.g., "Is Biden going to win in an hour?") could engage passengers with small, immediate bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>.

## Business Potential

A company implementing these enhanced [[monetization_potential_through_micro_saas | monetization strategies]] could achieve significant revenue, potentially exceeding $50 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>. Such a venture could operate with a lean team, for example, five engineers and one salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.

[!INFO] Key Takeaway
The core idea is to identify products with high user engagement but poor monetization and introduce new revenue models, especially those leveraging performance-based advertising and strong driver incentives.

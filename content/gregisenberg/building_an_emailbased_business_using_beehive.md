Starting an email-based business, such as a newsletter, is a recommended approach for individuals aiming to reach a monthly income of $10,000 to $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Platforms like Beehiiv simplify the process of growing from zero to 100,000 subscribers and generating significant monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Tyler Denk, co-founder of Beehiiv, previously helped Morning Brew achieve 3.5 million subscribers and a $75 million acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. He channeled his expertise into creating Beehiiv, a platform designed to facilitate the creation and growth of email newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Why Start an Email Newsletter?

An email newsletter is considered a highly leveraged career move, opening doors to opportunities such as Angel Investing, networking with founders, and fostering connections with inspiring individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. It can serve as a foundation for building trust, engagement, and a personal brand by consistently communicating one's essence and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.

A newsletter can be used for various goals:
*   **Monetization** through subscriptions, advertisements, and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>.
*   **Community Building and Thought Leadership** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.
*   **Driving traffic to other businesses** or agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>.

### Potential Revenue
A newsletter with 90,000 subscribers, managed as a side project with about five hours of work per week, can generate between $20,000 and $30,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This revenue stream can effectively cover living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Key Features of Beehiiv for Newsletter Growth

Beehiiv offers an all-in-one solution for managing a newsletter, integrating website building, automations, and monetization features, eliminating the need for multiple platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Website and Content Management
*   **Full Website Builder:** Beehiiv includes a customizable website builder where creators can design their own pages, including subscribe pages and archives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Integrated Publishing:** When a newsletter is published, it simultaneously becomes a web article, ensuring SEO optimization and a consistent presence across platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Email Capture Features:**
    *   **Pop-ups:** Customizable pop-ups can be added to specific pages, with logic to display different messages based on traffic sources (e.g., Facebook or Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   **Gated Content:** Posts can be gated, requiring visitors to subscribe to the newsletter before reading the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. This acts as a constant [[building_and_monetizing_lead_generation | lead magnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

### Subscriber Acquisition and Engagement
*   **Custom Signup Flows:** After a user subscribes, a custom flow can be configured to include interstitial steps like recommending other newsletters, surveys, and a final thank you page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Different flows can be set up for various acquisition sources (e.g., Twitter vs. LinkedIn) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Automations (Welcome Series):** An automated email journey can be set up for new subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This can be a simple welcome email or a multi-step sequence with logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
    *   **Building Trust:** Welcome emails can help build instant trust and humanize the creator, for example, by sharing a related Spotify playlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
    *   **Incentivizing Action:** These automations are ideal for pushing subscribers to take further actions, such as referring others or exploring other offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
    *   **Conditional Follow-ups:** Logic can be applied within automations to send follow-up emails if, for example, a subscriber skips a survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.
*   **Surveys:** Beehiiv has a native survey builder to collect data about new subscribers (e.g., first name, birthday, demographics, primary skills, goals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This data is crucial for understanding the audience, tailoring content, and attracting relevant sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Collecting such data early, when subscribers are most engaged, is highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
    *   This fosters "investment" from the reader, which can lead to higher engagement rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.
*   **Boost Network (Recommendations):** This is a two-sided marketplace within Beehiiv that allows publishers to:
    *   **Monetize:** Earn passive income by recommending other newsletters to their new subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. Publishers set a price per lead (e.g., $2-$4) and only pay if the referred subscriber opens and engages with emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.
    *   **Grow:** Promote their own newsletter on other publications within the network, gaining new subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. Filters can be applied to target specific demographics or engagement levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.
    *   The platform includes features like "autopause" to automatically stop promotions from underperforming sources based on open rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
*   **Referral Programs:** Native referral programs allow existing readers to invite new subscribers in exchange for rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.
    *   **Digital Rewards:** Cost-free rewards, such as exclusive PDF guides or digital assets, can be automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.
    *   **Physical Goods/Promos:** While physical goods can be costly, using drop-shipping or offering promo codes (e.g., $10 off merchandise) can make it cost-neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
    *   Simple rewards, like a valuable digital product for just one referral, tend to be very effective at encouraging initial participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.
    *   The program tracks referrals and automates reward delivery, including unique referral links embedded directly into the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies

An email-based business can be monetized through multiple channels on Beehiiv:

1.  **Paid Subscriptions:** Publishers can charge readers a monthly or annual fee (e.g., $5, $10, $20) for exclusive content or community access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>. Beehiiv does not take a cut of subscription revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. Automation can integrate paid tiers with Discord or Slack communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>.
2.  **Boost Network:** As described above, by recommending other newsletters, creators can earn passive income per lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>.
3.  **Direct Advertisements/Sponsorships:**
    *   **Sponsorship Storefront:** Beehiiv provides a public sponsorship storefront where advertisers can view newsletter statistics and book ad placements directly on an ad calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>. This feature charges a flat $10 transaction fee, but the creator retains all sponsorship revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.
    *   **Beehiiv Ad Network:** Beehiiv also has its own ad network, connecting publishers with premium brands (e.g., Netflix, Nike, HubSpot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Publishers can choose ad copy, schedule placements, and get paid per click, all managed within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.

Validating a startup idea without building the full product is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This approach was successfully used by Justin Mayers, who built Kettle and Fire into a nine-figure annual business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. His process involved understanding market demand and willingness to pay, utilizing tools like Google Trends and Bing Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Identifying a Problem and Market Opportunity

In 2014, while at Rackspace, Justin Mayers sought to start his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. He had heard about bone broth from friends in the CrossFit community and had been researching its benefits for skin, gut, and joint health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. At that time, bone broth was not widely discussed, and finding it online was difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. His main questions were:
1.  How many people wanted this product? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
2.  Would there be enough demand to start a meaningful business, and would people spend enough on it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>

## Leveraging Google Trends for Macro-Level Validation

To answer the first question, Justin began by observing niche communities where potential customers gathered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. He looked at forums and communities like Mark's Daily Apple, Paleo Hacks, and Reddit to assess traffic and engagement on threads discussing bone broth for health benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. He noted a "fanatic" and engaged group of people discussing recipes and sourcing bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Next, for a macro-level view, he turned to Google Trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This tool showed that "bone broth" was starting to trend upwards, indicating increasing public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

> "Then I looked at the macro level and I was like, okay, how are how is bone broth trending from a Google trend standpoint? And you could see it was starting to take off. More and more people were talking about bone broth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>

This dual approach, combining niche community engagement with broad trend analysis via Google Trends, helped confirm that at least several thousand people were interested in bone broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This was sufficient for his initial goal of building a business that could generate $10,000 a month in profit, requiring only a couple thousand customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Justin emphasized that he was solving his own problem and that Google Trends served as a validation tool for business viability, not the sole source of the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. If Google Trends had shown no interest and subsequent steps failed, he would not have proceeded with the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Using Bing Ads for Demand Validation and Price Testing

The crucial second question was whether people would pay enough to make it a meaningful business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. To test this, Justin created a minimum viable product (MVP) setup:
*   **Domain Name:** He purchased the cheapest available bone broth-related domain, bonebrothsco.com, for $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Minimal Branding:** He paid $5 on Fiverr for a basic logo and product renders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Landing Page:** He built a simple landing page using Unbounce, highlighting key value propositions identified from paleo forums: convenience, healing leaky gut, and using organic, grass-fed ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Pricing:** He set a price of $29.99 for 16 ounces, significantly higher than typical grocery store broth prices ($5 for 16 ounces), to ensure profitability if demand existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Janky Checkout Flow:** The "Order Now" button led directly to his personal PayPal account, where customers would send him money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This deliberately "sketchy" setup was part of the validation: if people would pay under these conditions, it signaled strong demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

To drive traffic to this landing page, Justin chose Bing Ads over Google Ads due to its lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

> "After spending about $100 on Bing ads because Bing was cheaper than than Adwords, we saw that people are actually like paying me money." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>

Over a two-week test, spending approximately $250 on ads, the "product" generated nearly $500 in revenue with a 30% conversion rate on the "order now" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This demonstrated clear willingness to pay, even for a non-existent product with a clunky checkout process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This validation led him to believe he could achieve at least $100,000 in annual sales with a proper product and flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Post-Validation and Modern Tools

After validating demand, Justin emailed all customers, explaining the product wasn't yet in stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. He offered a full refund or a 50% discount for those willing to wait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Most chose the discount, validating their strong interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. It took eight months to actually develop and scale the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

In 2025, with advancements in [[AI trends and market analysis | AI]] and other tools, Justin notes that the initial landing page and logo could be far superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. [[data analysis for identifying market opportunities | AI]] tools can quickly perform sentiment analysis across Reddit, forums, and Twitter, offering deeper insights into community discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Despite these advancements, the core principle of trying to sell a product before it exists remains a powerful validation method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

> "I still do think fundamentally that the um that the core thing of like try and sell a product even if it doesn't exist now and see if people will give you money for it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>

New tools like Bolt.new (for landing pages) and advanced AI models (like Claude, GPT, Gemini) enable individuals to build and test startups in a day, significantly lowering the barriers to entry for product development and market validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This allows for rapid testing of dozens of startup ideas per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. The focus for aspiring entrepreneurs should be on areas they are deeply interested in, as natural passion often leads to identifying unmet needs and being early to emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The data for [[data analysis for identifying market opportunities | market analysis]] and [[keyword_research_and_seo_optimization_using_ai | pain points]] is readily available; it's about effectively distilling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

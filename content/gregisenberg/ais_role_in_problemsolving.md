## [[Debugging_and_problemsolving_strategies_with_ai_coding | Challenges]] and [[Debugging_and_problemsolving_strategies_with_ai_coding | Strategies]] in AI-Assisted Problem-Solving

Developing with AI, especially when integrating complex features like databases or API calls, can be challenging and often involves encountering errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.

### Persistence and Agency

A key differentiator between successful AI users and those who give up is persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Users are encouraged to continue asking AI (like Claude or Cursor) for solutions, even if the first few attempts fail, as success is often achieved by the second or third try <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. This requires "high agency" â€“ taking charge and seeing problems through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Importance of [[Designing_with_ai_prompt_clarity | Prompt Clarity]] and Context

*   **Specific Instructions** Providing clear and detailed prompts is crucial for AI to generate desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Providing Purpose** Explaining the "purpose" of a feature or request can help AI understand the context and enhance its creativity in providing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.
*   **Visual Aids** For design-related issues, screenshotting and annotating visuals can be effective ways to communicate desired changes to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Treating AI as a Coworker** Interacting with AI as if it were a human coworker, giving it context and purpose, leads to better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

### [[Debugging_and_problemsolving_strategies_with_ai_coding | Dealing with Errors]]

*   **Error Logging** When AI tools don't provide explicit error messages, explicitly asking them to "add error logs" is a vital [[debugging_and_problemsolving_strategies_with_ai_coding | strategy]] to understand what's going wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. "Error messages are good, blank screens are bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.
*   **Pasting Errors to AI** Users can copy error messages directly and paste them back into the AI tool (like Cursor) with a request to "fix this problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.
*   **Negotiating with AI** Sometimes, one might need to "plea with" or "negotiate" with the AI to make it work, especially with complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.
*   **Reversibility** Using "save all" instead of "accept all" in Cursor allows users to reject unwanted changes more easily, as "accept all" is not easily reversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.

## Real-World Application: Startup Idea Evaluator

An example of AI's role in problem-solving is the creation of a "Startup Idea Evaluator" app. This app analyzes podcast transcripts to extract startup ideas, categorize them by market and internet audiences, and allows users to "sip" (like) or "spit" (dislike) ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

*   **Automated Content Analysis** The app can take a transcript and automatically output structured data (idea, market, internet audiences) related to startup concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.
*   **User Interaction and Data Storage** It incorporates interactive elements like a "sip or spit" slider with visual feedback (border color changes, animations) and saves liked ideas to a user's profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.
*   **Authentication** The app includes user authentication (e.g., Google sign-in) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.
*   **Potential for Further Automation** The entire process, from fetching transcripts to analysis and saving, could theoretically be fully automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.

## Conclusion

AI tools like V0, Cursor, Replet, and Perplexity empower individuals to "compose" code by describing their intentions in plain English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. While the process often involves [[debugging_and_problemsolving_strategies_with_ai_coding | encountering and resolving bugs]], the ability to rapidly prototype, iterate, and integrate complex functionalities without extensive coding knowledge makes AI a powerful ally in problem-solving for software development. The ongoing development of communities, like "Software Composers," aims to further democratize this skill by providing step-by-step courses and support for aspiring "software composers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>.

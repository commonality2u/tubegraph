The Apple Watch has introduced a feature capable of diagnosing sleep apnea, a disorder where individuals briefly stop breathing during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This condition often goes unnoticed by those affected, with an estimated 80% to 90% of cases remaining undiagnosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. The Apple Watch can automatically display an alert if it detects signs of sleep apnea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

## Impact and Opportunities

This technological advancement creates significant opportunities for various businesses and service providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>:

### Sleep Apnea Clinics and Hardware
The detection feature is expected to benefit sleep apnea clinics, as more people become aware of their condition and seek diagnosis and treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Obtaining a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine, a common treatment device, involves a rigorous process requiring a formal diagnosis, doctor consultation, and prescription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. These clinics often hold a "stranglehold" on CPAP hardware distribution, with machines costing around $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

Business opportunities in this area include:
*   Acquiring existing sleep apnea clinics, betting on a macro trend of increased diagnoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   Investing in companies within the sleep apnea industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   Developing review websites for sleep apnea hardware and treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   Establishing financing businesses specifically for purchasing sleep apnea hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

### Alternative Treatments
Many individuals are reluctant to use CPAP machines due to their appearance (likened to "Bane from Batman") and the discomfort they can cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. This presents an opportunity for alternative treatments, such as direct-to-consumer (DTC) oral devices or other appliances, to gain popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

### Digital Health Solutions
The integration of health monitoring into wearables opens doors for [[developing_health_diagnosis_apps_using_ai | AI app startups and ideas]]. An app could be developed to utilize Apple Watch data for more in-depth monitoring of sleep apnea or to coach users through managing their condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

### Broader Implications for Health Monitoring
The introduction of sleep apnea detection via Apple Watch highlights a broader trend in health technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. Similar advancements are anticipated, such as the future inclusion of blood glucose sensors in Apple Watches, which could lead to increased self-monitoring of blood sugar levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. This shift empowers millions to become more aware of and engage with new health trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

Other undiagnosed conditions that wearable technology could potentially help identify include:
*   **Atrial Fibrillation (AFib):** Smartwatches, including the Apple Watch, can detect irregular heart rhythms indicative of AFib <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.
*   **Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>
*   **Type 2 Diabetes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>
*   **Celiac Disease** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>
*   **Stress and Anxiety** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>

The potential for [[developing_health_diagnosis_apps_using_ai | AI]] to streamline diagnoses for mental health disorders like ADHD, anxiety, and depression is also significant, bypassing costly and often inaccessible traditional assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. This could involve [[health_data_integration_and_personal_ai_health_assistants | AI-powered mental health assessments]] that provide a comprehensive picture of one's well-being and suggest potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>. ADHD, specifically, is a large and often undiagnosed area with high potential for new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

A method has been developed to significantly improve the output quality from various Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini, reportedly yielding up to five times better results without additional cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This technique, shared on the Startup Ideas podcast, involves fostering a competitive environment among the AIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, essentially making them "jealous" of each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This approach can contribute to [[career_and_productivity_enhancement_through_ai | career and productivity enhancement through AI]] and [[using_ai_tools_for_business_growth | using AI tools for business growth]].

## The "AI Jealousy" Method

Traditionally, users might interact with one LLM at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. However, the "AI Jealousy" method proposes opening multiple LLMs simultaneously, such as two, three, or four, for a given task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The key steps are:

1.  **Simultaneous Prompting**: Ask the same prompt or task to each opened LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
2.  **Initial Output Review**: Collect and compare the responses from each LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
3.  **Inducing Competition**: Pit the LLMs against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This involves telling one LLM that another LLM's response was significantly better, and often involves sharing the "superior" output with the underperforming one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The LLMs' larger context windows mean they can understand user identity and conversational flow, allowing them to engage with this competitive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
4.  **Iterative Improvement**: Observe how the challenged LLM responds with an improved, more competitive output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Practical Example: Crafting a Cold Email

To illustrate this method, an example of creating a cold email for an agency called LCA, which specializes in [[improving_ai_designs_and_interfaces | designing AI interfaces]], was provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The goal was to generate a standout cold email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Initial Prompts

The same prompt was given to Grok and ChatGPT: "I want to create a cold email for my agency LCA. LCA is the premier design firm designing AI interfaces. But I want to make it a cold email that will stand out. Can you help me do this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>

### Grok's Initial Response

Grok produced an email emphasizing intuitive AI interfaces and LCA's expertise in crafting captivating designs. It included a call to action for a 15-minute call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The creator rated it a 9 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### ChatGPT's Initial Response

ChatGPT generated an email with the subject "Your AI deserves better design." It highlighted LCA's focus on making people trust AI and improving user engagement, offering a quick "tear down" or Loom video with ideas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The creator rated it a 5 out of 10, considering it "average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Challenging ChatGPT

ChatGPT was then prompted with feedback stating: "Grock crushed it and was a nine on 10. Chat GBT was kind of average and was five on 10. I thought you were the better LLM. What's going on? I will share what Grock did as an FYI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Grok's email was then shared with ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### ChatGPT's Improved Response

Upon receiving the competitive feedback and Grok's output, ChatGPT generated a significantly improved email. It acknowledged Grok's "polished" version but argued for a "fresher" and "harder-punching" approach, tailored to the creator's known persona (Greg Eisenberg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The revised email was rated 9.5 out of 10, described as a "standing ovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It emphasized LCA's obsession with AI UX, mentioning work with companies like Slack, Grammarly, and Shopify to make AI feel "magical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Challenging Claude

The same competitive tactic was applied to Claude, implying that ChatGPT's output was 10 times better and questioning Claude's perceived superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Claude responded by acknowledging the distinctive voice and edge of the shared example, confirming its understanding of the user's persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

This method effectively leverages a form of "AI rivalry" to extract higher quality and more tailored results from LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

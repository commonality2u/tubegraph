## Practical Tips for Getting the Most Out of vzer

### 1. Start with Screenshots

A highly effective way to begin with [[introduction_to_vercel_and_vzer | vzer]] is by providing screenshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This helps [[introduction_to_vercel_and_vzer | vzer]] understand the desired visual direction.

### 2. Leverage Creative Modes

There are two primary creative modes when using [[introduction_to_vercel_and_vzer | vzer]]:
*   **Opinionated Design**: If you have a clear vision or opinion on how something should look (e.g., a music player similar to Spotify but with more information density), start with that in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **AI-Driven Exploration**: If you don't have a specific design in mind, let the [[ai_tools_for_app_development | AI tool]] generate initial designs, and then iterate from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. For example, to build a simple link-to-Slack integration, [[introduction_to_vercel_and_vzer | vzer]] can create a functional component in "one shot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

### 3. Iterate with Specific Prompts

Refining your design involves providing specific prompts to [[introduction_to_vercel_and_vzer | vzer]]:
*   **Design Aesthetics**: Ask for specific colors (e.g., "warmer Grays"), fonts (e.g., "Sanda font from Google fonts with next font"), or information density (e.g., "tighter information density") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.
*   **Element Refinement**: Request changes to specific elements (e.g., "the time playing bar should be longer," "search input should have an actual input") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.
*   **Data Integration**: Ask for "more realistic fake data for the songs" initially, which can later be replaced with real API calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   **Explicit CSS/Tailwind Instructions**: [[introduction_to_vercel_and_vzer | vzer]] "thinks in Tailwind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. If you know Tailwind CSS classes or general CSS properties (e.g., `size four`, `tabular nums`), you can explicitly tell [[introduction_to_vercel_and_vzer | vzer]] to use them to steer the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.
*   **Natural Language**: You can use normal language, similar to how you'd talk to a designer, to describe desired changes (e.g., "the now playing bar is pretty wide... I would probably make that less") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

### 4. Integrate Images and Assets

Uploading or pasting images into [[introduction_to_vercel_and_vzer | vzer]] allows it to use those assets in the designs, significantly improving the visual output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Web design heavily relies on typography and imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

### 5. Prioritize Responsiveness and Interaction

*   **Mobile Responsiveness**: Always ask [[introduction_to_vercel_and_vzer | vzer]] to "make it mobile responsive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. Be specific if initial attempts aren't ideal (e.g., "I can't see the table of songs because the image is so large, can you fix it?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.
*   **Interactivity**: Once the UI is stable, ask [[introduction_to_vercel_and_vzer | vzer]] to break it into components and add logic and interactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

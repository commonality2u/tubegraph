Frey, an online directory expert, teaches how to build online directories that can generate between $2,000 and $10,000 a month in passive income, requiring only about 15 minutes of work per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. His approach focuses on evergreen, location-based directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

The tutorial focuses on the entire process of [[building_a_profitable_online_directory | building a profitable online directory]], from finding and validating a niche to data enrichment and implementation, with a strong emphasis on [[seo_optimization_for_directory_websites | SEO optimization for directory websites]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Key Monetization Strategies

### 1. Display Ads
The most common and straightforward [[monetization_methods_for_newsletters | monetization method]] for directory websites, often providing a passive income stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This method is particularly effective with "pillar page" static directories, which are long pages that can accommodate many ad placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

Examples of directories heavily relying on display ads:
*   **Roadside America** (`roadsideamerica.com`): A directory of quirky roadside attractions in the United States, receiving 85,000 monthly visitors and generating an estimated $5,000 to $7,000 per month passively through display ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Atlas Obscura** (`atlasobscura.com`): A worldwide directory of off-the-beaten-path attractions, boasting 7.1 million monthly visitors and earning a conservative estimate of $30,000 to $60,000 per month from display ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **FindAGrave** (`findagrave.com`): A directory for finding burial sites, receiving 1.4 million monthly visitors and potentially earning $60,000 to $100,000 per month through AdSense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### 2. Selling Products
Some directories integrate direct product sales. For instance, Atlas Obscura also generates revenue by selling a book related to its content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### 3. Building Software (SaaS) on Top
A more sophisticated [[monetization_and_scaling_business_ideas | monetization and scaling business idea]] involves using the directory to drive traffic to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This allows for higher "SAS-like multiples" on the business valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. An example is a directory for farms and CSAs that funnels its relevant website traffic into a SaaS product they own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This strategy uses the directory as a traffic acquisition channel for a more valuable software offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### 4. Affiliate Marketing
Particularly relevant for niches with existing product ecosystems, like the pet space. For a dog park directory, there could be affiliate partnerships with companies like BarkBox, selling dog-related products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

### 5. Lead Generation / Newsletters
Directories can be used to collect valuable data and build an email list by offering a "lead magnet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. This data can then be leveraged for further monetization or business development, such as a newsletter on dog care or other related topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Directory Building
Starting with a simple directory can create "mailbox money" â€“ consistent income that covers bills and provides financial freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>. This allows creators to either maintain a comfortable lifestyle business or use it as a foundation to build a much larger venture, such as a SaaS product or a consumer brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.

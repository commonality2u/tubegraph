In the context of Vibe Marketing, building and leveraging communities plays a significant role, particularly in sharing knowledge and gathering insights related to marketing automation with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Community Building and Engagement

A key aspect of this approach involves sharing workflows and knowledge with a social audience and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This strategy contributes to [[content_marketing_and_community_building | community building]] by providing valuable content and fostering interaction. The "Boring Marketer" actively shares these workflows, even making them available in a dedicated community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

## Leveraging Community Insights

Communities can be a rich source of information for refining strategies and identifying challenges. For instance, a survey conducted within a marketing community revealed that a significant challenge marketers face with AI is brand safety and ensuring content aligns with their brand voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:03">[03:41:03]</a>. This directly demonstrates how communities contribute to [[formulating_marketing_strategies_through_community_insights | formulating marketing strategies through community insights]].

## Community Size and Activities

An example of a thriving marketing community includes:
*   Over 1,500 members in a "School" platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   Another 1,000 members in a Slack community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
*   Collectively, these communities comprise approximately 2,500 "Vibe marketers" who engage daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

Within these communities, members actively:
*   Post questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   Discuss challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   Share innovative workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

To further support members, a "classroom" has been launched within the community to provide step-by-step guidance on setting up and experimenting with workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This highlights the role of communities in [[building_supportive_communities_for_entrepreneurs | building supportive communities for entrepreneurs]].

The Boring Marketer also engages in "vibe coding" and "vibe marketing" as a service, offering custom solutions for businesses to automate manual marketing tasks by identifying where time is manually spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. This showcases how expertise developed within a community can be commercialized.

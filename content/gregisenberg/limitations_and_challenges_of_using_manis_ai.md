While [[overview_of_manis_ais_capabilities | Manis AI]] is lauded for its ability to turn ideas into fully automated businesses and products [00:00:07], it also presents several limitations and challenges during its operation. These issues range from technical hurdles to user experience and security concerns.

## Technical Limitations

### Performance and Stability
Manis AI is noted to be "not perfect" and "still in beta" [00:31:17], [00:57:12]. Users have reported that Manis AI can get "stuck" during tasks [00:25:02], [00:56:11], and may encounter "critical issues" or "terminal errors" during processes like zipping files or deployment [00:31:00], [00:35:59]. Although the system attempts to handle errors on its own by reflecting on them and attempting to resolve them [00:36:19], this does not always guarantee success [00:31:27].

### Context Length and Complexity
One significant limitation is related to its "context limitation" [00:44:27]. Manis AI's "performance May decline with extremely long context," particularly when dealing with "very complex task" that requires processing a lot of information [00:44:19], [00:44:45]. This can lead to the system asking the user to reset the computer or start a new session, potentially losing progress [00:45:31], [00:45:47].

### Deployment Issues
While Manis AI can generate code for applications like a DocuSign clone, it has demonstrated issues with direct deployment to a public network [00:35:02], [00:54:47]. The system may instead suggest running the project locally [00:35:14], [00:46:09]. Deployment is described as "not as straightforward with these tools" [00:47:19], and it's suggested that Manis AI may be "trying to do too much" by packaging all services, including deployment [00:47:45]. This leads to issues like "maximum daily usage limit" for certain tasks [00:48:44].

## User Experience and Access Challenges

### Need for Human Intervention
Despite its advanced capabilities, Manis AI sometimes requires "human in the loop" features [00:08:13]. For instance, it has been known to get "stuck on captchas" and may ask for user intervention, confirmation, or additional context [00:08:03], [00:08:18]. Users can also "interrupt it in between" to adjust the approach or focus, such as limiting a project to specific functionalities [00:13:10], [00:14:15].

### Access and Usage Limits
Currently, [[overview_of_manis_ais_capabilities | Manis AI]] is "Invitation Only" [00:49:57], limiting public access. There is also a "maximum daily usage limit," reportedly around 10 requests or 10 sessions per day [00:48:44], [00:57:15], [00:57:18]. While a workaround involving starting a different session has been noted [00:57:41], this indicates a clear constraint on heavy usage.

### Scalability Concerns
With more users gaining access to Manis AI, the system has experienced "more frequent errors" and its web service has been "hammered" [00:50:48], [00:50:50], [00:50:57]. This suggests that "scale is a challenge" for the company, which needs to be addressed before a full public launch [00:49:44], [00:51:08].

## Security and Trust Concerns

### Data Privacy with Chinese Company
A significant concern for users is the fact that Manis AI is a Chinese company [00:26:59], [00:27:07]. It is noted that Chinese companies are "obligated to give access to the government" [00:27:40], leading to reluctance among some users regarding data privacy [00:27:49]. Users are advised to be "very careful and mindful of what type of data that you give to and give access to" [00:29:21], and to avoid throwing "any personal information" on these tools [00:28:04], [00:33:55].

### Code Review for Local Deployments
When downloading code for local deployment, it is crucial for users to "scan through the code just in case" [00:55:18]. This practice is recommended to ensure safety and prevent potential security issues, highlighting the need for caution even when the AI generates the code [00:55:40].

## The Opportunity in Vertical SaaS
Vertical SaaS, or industry-specific software, presents significant opportunities to build enduring and profitable businesses by focusing on a single market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Unlike broad "horizontal" software, [[vertical_saas_business_model_and_its_opportunities | vertical SaaS]] is tailored to specific industries, aiming to optimize operations, create efficiencies, save costs, or lift revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. While often perceived as "boring," this niche focus can lead to substantial financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A key aspect of building a successful vertical SaaS business involves strategic [[pricing_and_monetization_strategies_for_ai_businesses | pricing and monetization strategies]], particularly the integration of payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

## Incorporating Payments for Massive Scale
Adding payments to a [[vertical_saas_business_model_and_its_opportunities | vertical SaaS]] solution is crucial for building massive companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. Every large industry-specific software company typically "owns the transaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

### The Impact of Payments on Market Size
Consider the example of Toast, a publicly traded [[vertical_saas_business_model_and_its_opportunities | vertical SaaS]] business for restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>:
*   Initially, a simple software charging $10/month to 1 million U.S. restaurants would result in an annual software market size of $120 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.
*   However, by implementing payments and taking a percentage of every transaction, the market size dramatically increases. These 1 million restaurants generate approximately $1 trillion in revenue annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>. Even a small percentage of that transaction volume creates a significantly larger addressable market for the software company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

### Strategic Integration with Wedge Products
If a [[vertical_saas_business_model_and_its_opportunities | vertical SaaS]] product can be positioned either before or after the core business transaction, it creates an opportunity to eventually capture and own that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>. For instance, in trade schools, where payments were processed inefficiently through services like PayPal, integrating payments directly into the school's existing software (which students already used daily) streamlined the process and provided significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.

## Pricing Strategies for Vertical SaaS
[[Subscription_models_and_pricing_strategies | Pricing strategies]] are often overlooked in software development but are critical for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.

### Value-Based Pricing Principles
The core philosophy for [[pricing_models_and_revenue_strategies_for_ai_apps | pricing models and revenue strategies]] in [[vertical_saas_business_model_and_its_opportunities | vertical SaaS]] is to build software that directly impacts the customer's bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>. Software should either:
1.  **Increase Revenue** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>
2.  **Decrease Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>
3.  **Prevent Customer Churn** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>
4.  **Maintain Compliance** (especially in highly regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>

By focusing on these areas, businesses can demonstrate clear Return on Investment (ROI) to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.

### Calculating and Communicating Value
To determine pricing, understand what the customer is currently paying for the problem your software solves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. The goal is to charge a portion of the value your software provides, typically starting around 50% of the ROI and adjusting based on market feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.

<br>
> [!EXAMPLE] **Corsky's Retention Tool Pricing**
> For trade schools struggling with student retention, a retention tool was developed to analyze academic and attendance data, identify at-risk students, and send automated motivational texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
> *   **Problem Cost:** Each student's tuition was $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. Schools were losing millions annually due to a 70% retention rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.
> *   **Value Provided:** Saving just five students halfway through their program would translate to significant revenue for the school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.
> *   **Pricing:** The software could be priced high because it directly forecast and delivered substantial savings (ROI) to the schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. The average lift was calculated at 3% based on business inputs, allowing the software to be priced at less than half of the calculated ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.

> [!NOTE] **Follow the Money**
> A key strategy for success is to "follow the money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. Analyze customer P&Ls (profit and loss statements) to understand where they are spending money, especially on personnel or fragmented software solutions that could be automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. This identifies high-impact areas for software solutions.

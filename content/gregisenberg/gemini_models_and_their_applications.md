*   **Gemma** An open-source version of the models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

### Key Capabilities

#### Long Context
One of the most impressive features is the ability to handle long contexts, such as processing a 30-minute video (531,000 tokens) to extract information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This capability makes it possible to process large amounts of data that would be extremely difficult or impossible with traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

#### Multimodal Understanding
Gemini models excel in multimodal capabilities, processing various data types:
*   **Image and Video Analysis** They can analyze images (e.g., a hurricane) to extract information through OCR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. They can also process videos, extracting lists of exhibits from a museum tour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Audio Analysis** The models can extract intelligence from long audio, like podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   **Spatial Understanding** This capability allows the model to deeply understand and visually represent objects, dynamically overlaying 2D bounding boxes on images to identify items and their coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.

#### Reasoning Models
The reasoning models represent a "New Frontier" of AI capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. They allow the model to "think" before generating output, similar to outlining an essay or code structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. This internal thought process, while abstracted in the API, is showcased in the [[Prototyping tools like Cursor and Vzer | AI Studio]] UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. For example, a reasoning model can take a simple code snippet and outline the steps to create a fully-fledged website, landing page, and SaaS application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

#### Function Calling
Gemini models support native function calling, enabling them to connect with existing products and APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. An example includes linking [[Prototyping tools like Cursor and Vzer | AI Studio]] with the Google Maps API to create a "geoguesser" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:25]</a>. This allows for a "combinatorial explosion" of new product experiences by integrating AI with five or more different existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.

#### Real-time Streaming (Multimodal Live API)
The Multimodal Live API powers real-time streaming, allowing the AI to "see" and "hear" what the user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>. This enables [[designing_characters_as_the_new_apps | AI co-presence]], where the AI can provide context and assistance dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>. An example demonstrates the AI providing real-time coding assistance, identifying errors and suggesting fixes while observing the user's screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. This API also supports native tool integration, code execution in a Python virtual environment, and internet browsing for grounding information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>.

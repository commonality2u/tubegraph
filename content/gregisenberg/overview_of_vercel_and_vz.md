Vercel is a well-known platform within the startup and web development community, recognized for its various products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. VZ, a product built by Vercel, functions as an AI assistant specifically designed for [[Using VZ for web development | web development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## What is VZ?

VZ aims to streamline the web development process by focusing on common web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as new frameworks and libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Its core objective is to facilitate the creation of high-quality designs and ultimately, high-quality products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

### Key Capabilities

VZ serves both aesthetic and functional development needs:
*   **UI Generation** VZ can generate user interfaces, helping developers create visually appealing designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   **Backend Work** Beyond visual design, VZ can assist with backend tasks, such as structuring database schemas and generating Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) for various programming languages like JavaScript (Drizzle, Prisma), Ruby on Rails, or Laravel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. It can even suggest database optimizations like using indexes for faster queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>.
*   **Interactivity** It can add interactivity to designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Component-Based Development** VZ can break down designs into modular components and apply logic to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. It is built on Shad CN UI, which enables the creation of custom component libraries and generates real React components suitable for production websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>.

## How to Get the Most Out of VZ

### Starting the Design Process
Users can approach design with VZ in two ways:
1.  **Opinionated Mode** If a user has a specific design in mind, they can provide screenshots or detailed descriptions to guide VZ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Starting with screenshots is particularly helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
2.  **Exploratory Mode** For users who are unsure about the design, VZ can generate initial concepts based on a general idea, allowing users to iterate from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### Guiding VZ with Prompts and Knowledge

*   **Specific Instructions** Users can provide precise instructions for design elements, such as color schemes (e.g., "warmer Grays"), fonts (e.g., "Sanda font from Google fonts with next font"), or information density (e.g., "tighter information density") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
*   **Tailwind CSS Integration** VZ interprets Tailwind CSS. Users can explicitly provide Tailwind class names to control design elements precisely (e.g., "make it size four") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
*   **Natural Language** Users can communicate with VZ using natural, conversational language, similar to how they would interact with a human designer or pair programmer (e.g., "the now playing bar is pretty wide," "make it animate faster") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   **Image Integration** Users can upload images for VZ to incorporate into designs, significantly impacting the visual appeal of web pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **Advanced CSS/Design Concepts** For users with existing web design or CSS knowledge, providing specific CSS properties like `tabular-nums` can help steer VZ towards desired outcomes (e.g., ensuring numbers are vertically aligned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. Similarly, for animations, users can specify easing functions like `cubic-bezier` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:00">[25:08:00]</a>.
*   **Learning on the Fly** Even without prior design expertise, users can ask VZ for guidance on common design practices (e.g., "I'm a novice at web design... what can I try to make things look a little better?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. VZ can provide advice on consistent color schemes, white space, readable fonts (e.g., sans-serif), responsive design, and using high-quality images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. Users can also ask for definitions of design terms, like "what is a sans-serif font?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>.
*   **Inspiration** Users can leverage external resources like Godly.website or Pattern.com for design inspiration, and then use screenshots from these sites as starting points for VZ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. Looking at favorite apps for examples of specific pages (e.g., settings pages) can also provide useful references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>.

## The Future of Building with AI

AI tools like VZ are not intended to replace developers but to augment their capabilities, acting as a knowledgeable "super senior engineer" or "pair programmer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:00">[27:21:00]</a>. They empower builders to bring their ideas to life by handling complex coding and design tasks, enabling faster prototyping and product development across various platforms, including iOS and Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40:00">[27:40:00]</a>.

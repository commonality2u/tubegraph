From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Many businesses, particularly small ones and startups, often overlook or dismiss the power of paid advertising. There's a significant "empty space in the market" for non-agency companies or solo practitioners who can help businesses effectively run paid ads on platforms like Facebook and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Why Paid Advertising is Crucial
Paid ads are a fundamental way to [[building_successful_businesses_through_targeted_media_strategies | build and grow a business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. While some businesses pride themselves on not running paid ads, viewing it as a "status symbol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, this perspective can hinder growth. Not leveraging paid ads means missing out on potential revenue and clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. For small teams or solo entrepreneurs, ads are "so so helpful" when massive branding campaigns or TV advertisements are not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. The ability to "put money into the machine" and have it find people for your business is incredibly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

## Addressing Misconceptions About Paid Ads
Many people believe that [[the_role_of_facebook_ads_in_business_growth | Facebook ads]] or [[paid_advertisement_methods_for_app_growth | Meta ads]] "don't work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This often stems from negative experiences with overpriced agencies or "douchy" consultants who project an intimidating image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
A common misconception is that Meta ads are "dead," but this is largely true only for audiences under 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. For people over 40, Meta ads can work "really, really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Many businesses fail to consider that a significant portion of the population is still actively using these platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. Furthermore, even simple [[profitable_startup_ideas_using_google_ads | Google ads]] can be challenging for companies to set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Opportunities for Paid Ad Consultants
There's a "massive empty space" for "not douchy, non-agency companies" or single-person shows that help others run Facebook and Google ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. These consultants can specialize in specific verticals and build trust with clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Examples include:
*   Salons and hair salons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
*   Female product owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>
*   Patreon accounts for creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>
*   Wellness (yoga retreats, meditation) and design spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>
*   Art installations and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>

A highly effective business model for such consultants is to offer services on a percentage of revenue basis, rather than a fixed monthly fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. For instance, helping a yoga retreat fill up by taking a cut of every ticket sale generated through ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

## Building a Funnel with Paid Ads: A Case Study
A successful funnel using paid ads involves a multi-step process, focusing on return on ad spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. One example of a "$10 million funnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a> that has been running since November 2020 involves:
1.  **Facebook/Google Ads:** These ads sell a free training video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.
2.  **Opt-in Page:** This page offers a free training video (or lead magnet like a PDF/physical book) in exchange for an email address and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. Tools like Framer (for aesthetics) or ClickFunnels (for quick testing) can be used to build these pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.
3.  **Video Sales Letter (VSL):** A training video, drawing inspiration from books like "Expert Secrets," which sells a free consultation call instead of directly selling a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. This allows potential customers to experience the quality of training offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
4.  **Call Booking:** Prospects book a free call with a career coach or sales team via a tool like Calendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>.
5.  **Conversion:** During the call, the team aims to sell higher-ticket programs or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.

### Funnel Performance Example (June)
*   **Total Ad Spend:** $86,000 (Facebook, Google, YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>
*   **Total Revenue:** $252,000 - $270,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>
*   **Return on Investment (ROI):** 38% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>
*   **Call Bookings:** 339 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>
*   **Attendees to Calls:** 273 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>
*   **Units Sold (Workshop/Master Program):** 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>

This funnel is constantly tweaked and optimized at every step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

## Funnels vs. Websites
A key distinction:
*   **Website:** "A business card, just saying here's all the stuff we do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.
*   **Funnel:** "A step-by-step process to bring someone from being a stranger to a customer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.

## Conversion Optimization and Copywriting
Effective ad campaigns rely heavily on [[tactical_marketing_techniques_for_b2b_and_b2c_startups | conversion rate optimization]] and strong copywriting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.
*   **Focus on ROAS:** Obsess over the return on ad spend, ensuring that money invested generates significant returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.
*   **Iterative Testing:** Get the funnel or landing page out quickly, then continuously tweak and optimize based on performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.
*   **Email Marketing:** Nurture leads gathered through funnels with targeted email campaigns. Even with high unsubscribe rates, the goal is to maximize sales while minimizing unsubscribes, understanding that some people may just prefer free content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

### Copywriting Hacks
Copywriting, the art of writing compelling text, is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.
1.  **Status Appeal:** Ask if the copy pushes towards the idea of increasing someone's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. People often buy things because they believe it will make them "look better to my peers" or increase their value to colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>.
2.  **Pain vs. Pleasure:** When writing headlines, consider whether to appeal to moving away from pain or towards pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>.
    *   **Away from pain:** Highlights avoiding negative situations (e.g., "Never get stuck in the airport without your podcast equipment again" for a portable microphone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. This approach is often more effective during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.
    *   **Towards pleasure:** Focuses on the positive benefits and desirable outcomes (e.g., "how beautiful this thing is and how nice it sounds") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. This works well in prosperous times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>.

## When to Start with Ads
While paid ads offer immediate reach, some suggest starting with organic content first to dial in messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. By testing messages on platforms like Twitter or Instagram, businesses can refine their pitch before investing in ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. However, learning [[effective_use_of_seo_and_paid_ads_for_startup_growth | paid advertising]] as a discipline is valuable, as it prevents helplessness when needing to sell a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. Building a "shadow funnel" of high-quality free content (e.g., YouTube videos) can also build trust and improve conversion rates for ad-driven funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. This approach complements paid efforts by providing social proof and deeper engagement.

### Tracking
While complex attribution tools exist (like Hyros), focusing on overall company growth and ad spend ROI can be sufficient, assuming good content supports the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. The goal is to ensure incoming revenue significantly outweighs expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.

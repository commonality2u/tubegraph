The core message is that these powerful [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | tools]] make creating beautifully generated graphics surprisingly simple, with no magic behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Even individuals without prior design knowledge can create significant value using these [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. While having good taste helps, a lack of traditional design skills is not a barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Getting Started with AI Creation

For those new to [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | AI]] creation, various generative [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | AI]] realms exist, including image and video generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Higsfield: The Easiest Entry Point

Higsfield offers an accessible way to begin [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | AI]] creation, especially for those with no prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
It provides templates that simplify the process of "talking" to the [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This means users don't need to understand complex directional jargon like "dolly in" or "dolly out" for video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

#### Example: Product Ad Generation
Users can select a preset, upload a product image (e.g., a Liquid Death can), and generate a professional-looking ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | tool]] considers the product's branding and can even swap models while maintaining text integrity on the product, a feature that was previously a "problem child" in [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | AI]] generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

This [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | tool]] offers presets, options for specific prompting, reference photo uploads, and various effects like turning objects into metal or controlling basic camera movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. It's excellent for creating cool ads for social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## MidJourney and ChatGPT: The Core Combination

For more advanced and artistic generation, the real power lies in combining [[MidJourney as a new design canvas | MidJourney]] and ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. While many [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | AI tools]] exist, sticking to a few like [[MidJourney as a new design canvas | MidJourney]] and ChatGPT is recommended for focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### MidJourney: Artistic Styling
[[MidJourney as a new design canvas | MidJourney]] excels at styling, allowing users to generate artistic images with specific aesthetics, such as Kodak vintage aerial photos of a golf course or images for a surfer brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It is considered unparalleled for artistic styling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### ChatGPT: Specificity and Prompt Generation
ChatGPT is used for generating images with very specific details, like inserting a realistic golfer into an aerial golf course photo, which [[MidJourney as a new design canvas | MidJourney]] might struggle with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

Crucially, these [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | systems]] are only as good as the prompts and reference images provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### The "Prompting is Not a Skill" Revolution
Previously, writing effective prompts required author-level skills in description and visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. However, ChatGPT has made prompting accessible, making it no longer a "gatekept" skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

#### How Prompts Work in MidJourney
[[MidJourney as a new design canvas | MidJourney]] uses a simple system:
*   **Text Prompts**: Describe what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Image Prompts**: Insert a photo to influence the content of the generated image (e.g., a surfer to include a person or surfboard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Style References**: Upload an image to dictate the aesthetic (colors, shadows, highlights, depth of field) of the generated image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Mixing different style references can lead to surprising results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

#### Workflow Example: Cowboy Art
1.  **ChatGPT for Prompts**: Ask ChatGPT to generate detailed prompts for specific scenes (e.g., "zoomed in photo of a cowboy in the back of a horse riding the rains") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. ChatGPT can expand on simple requests and add rich detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. It can even generate collections of related scenes for consistent branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
2.  **MidJourney for Generation**: Plug the ChatGPT-generated prompt into [[MidJourney as a new design canvas | MidJourney]], along with a chosen style image (often found on Pinterest for stylistic directions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

> "You have to basically have a very basic idea of what you want. Prompt that in chat GPT. Say, 'Hey, make me a prompt around this idea or make me several and take those and just start plugging in the midjourney. Find a style that you want.' Like Pinterest is phenomenal for this." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>

## Runway: Adding Motion to AI Art

Once images are generated in [[MidJourney as a new design canvas | MidJourney]], [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | tools]] like Runway can add motion to them, turning static images into dynamic videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

### Workflow: Image to Video
1.  **Prompt for Motion**: Use ChatGPT to create a prompt that tells Runway what specific movements to apply to the image (e.g., "soft ripples in the water," "smoke coming," "trees blowing softly in the wind") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
2.  **Upload and Generate**: Upload the image to Runway, paste the prompt, and select desired settings (e.g., square aspect ratio for X/Twitter sharing to avoid black borders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
3.  **Refinement**: While powerful, [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | tools]] like Runway are not perfect and may produce finicky results or strange artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Users might need to adjust prompts and re-generate.

### Advanced Techniques
*   **Continuous Shots**: Save the last frame of a generated video, upload it as the start frame for the next video, and stitch them together with a simple video editing tool for seamless, longer shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   **Upscaling**: Videos can be upscaled to 4K with a single click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.
*   **AI Sound**: Tools like Cling can generate [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | AI]] sound options based on the video context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **External Editing**: For precise text overlays or other elements, export the video and use user-friendly video platforms like CapCut, which allows dragging text layers onto the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

## Opportunities for Startups and Non-Designers

The current biggest opportunity for creatives and startup founders using [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | AI]] is in **branding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

[[AI tools for validating and developing startup ideas | AI tools]] enable the creation of consistent, cohesive branded content:
*   **Mood Boards in MidJourney**: Users can set up a mood board in [[MidJourney as a new design canvas | MidJourney]] using a specific code as a prompt. This ensures that all generated content references back to the mood board, maintaining visual consistency across various assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.
*   **Rapid Asset Generation**: Once core design pieces are established, [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | AI]] allows for very fast replication and building of new creatives, all while maintaining a cohesive brand identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

While [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | AI]] is not yet perfect for logo design, entire brand generation, or vector art, it excels at generating consistent assets quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. The ability to take a single image (e.g., a building) and ask [[AI tools and productivity enhancement | AI]] to generate different angles or scenes for a magazine listing, then animate them, creates dynamic multi-scene videos very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. This has strong use cases for advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

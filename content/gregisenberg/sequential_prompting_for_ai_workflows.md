[[Sequential prompting for AI workflows]] is a technique for chaining multiple AI tools together to create complex outputs, moving beyond single-tool interactions or simple conversational exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. It differs from a purely conversational approach (back-and-forth with a single AI model like ChatGPT) and a master prompt approach (a single, large prompt designed for a complete output) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

The core idea behind [[sequential prompting for AI workflows]] is that an AI tool, such as ChatGPT, can be used to generate a *new prompt* that is then fed into a *different* AI tool to produce a subsequent output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This chain-like process allows for sophisticated and customized results across various applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

## How it Works: The Sequential Flow

The process typically begins with a manual phase to refine the prompts and understand the desired output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. Once the workflow is stable and satisfactory, it can be automated using tools like Zapier or Make, or by connecting AI model APIs programmatically with an engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

A typical workflow involves the following steps and tools:

1.  **Input into ChatGPT**:
    *   Start with a user-provided image (e.g., a photo of a child) and basic character information (name, age, gender) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
    *   A pre-defined prompt is given to ChatGPT, instructing it to analyze the image and generate a detailed textual description suitable for image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This description includes elements like hairstyle, skin tone, accessories, and outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
    *   This output from ChatGPT serves as the primary prompt for maintaining character consistency across a narrative or series of images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
    *   ChatGPT's API can programmatically send this generated prompt to other tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

2.  **Image Generation with Leonardo AI**:
    *   The prompt generated by ChatGPT is then fed into an image generation tool like [[Leonardo Ai | Leonardo AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
    *   [[Leonardo Ai | Leonardo AI]] can create high-resolution, Disney-style or Pixar-like images very quickly (e.g., in four seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
    *   Settings like aspect ratio (e.g., 16x9 for widescreen) can be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
    *   [[Leonardo Ai | Leonardo AI]] also offers an API for programmatic image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

3.  **Video Animation with Cling AI**:
    *   Images generated by [[Leonardo Ai | Leonardo AI]] can be uploaded to [[Cling Ai | Cling AI]] to turn them into short videos or animated clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
    *   [[Cling Ai | Cling AI]] can also incorporate additional prompts to guide the character's actions within the scene (e.g., "sip the cup") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.
    *   It has a lip-sync feature to make characters speak provided words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.
    *   While video generation is currently slower (e.g., four minutes for a five-second clip), it is expected to accelerate significantly with advancements like Sora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. [[Cling Ai | Cling AI]] also provides an API for automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>.

4.  **Voiceovers with 11 Labs**:
    *   Voiceovers can be added to the animated videos using tools like 11 Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

5.  **Background Removal (for stickers/merchandise) with Remove.BG**:
    *   For physical products like stickers, an image generated by [[Leonardo Ai | Leonardo AI]] can be processed through Remove.BG to automatically remove its background, creating a clean PNG sticker asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. Remove.BG also has an API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.

6.  **Physical Product Fulfillment with Printful**:
    *   The final digital assets (e.g., PNG stickers) can be integrated with print-on-demand services like Printful via their API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
    *   This enables automated fulfillment of physical products like stickers, clothing, and t-shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. Printful integrates well with e-commerce platforms like Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>.

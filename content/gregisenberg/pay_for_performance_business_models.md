Pay for performance is an exciting business model that offers a distinct advantage by aligning client and provider incentives, ensuring payment is tied directly to results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. While the concept of performance-based compensation isn't new, its potential is expanding, especially with advancements in data and [[business_models_in_ai_with_data_or_network_effect_advantages | AI]].

## The Appeal of Pay for Performance
Marketers who are confident in their abilities should ideally charge based on performance, as this model minimizes risk for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. In an [[business_models_in_ai_with_data_or_network_effect_advantages | AI]] and data-rich world, marketers can leverage more information to underwrite opportunities and confidently bet on their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This model offers a significant advantage as it shifts the risk from the client to the service provider, who only gets paid if they deliver results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Examples of Pay for Performance Models

### Performance-Based Agencies
One example is a pay for performance agency that generates $80 million annually with $30 million in profit and only 30 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This agency focuses on a single industry, excelling in [[paid_advertising_strategies_and_common_pitfalls | paid advertising]] and copywriting, and leveraging technical co-founders to build specialized tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For clients in the finance industry, for instance, they might offer to run traffic and generate leads, getting paid a set amount (e.g., $500) per customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The client has no long-term commitment and only pays if performance is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Another example is a pay for performance agency in the telecoms sector that has grown to over $1 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. They started by driving leads through Google Ads and getting paid per lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. As they grew, they began acquiring call centers to "gift wrap" customers for major telecom companies like AT&T and Verizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This model requires minimal capital expenditures to set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Industries that offer high Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) are particularly suited for this model, such as:
*   Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>
*   Crypto, especially for large exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   Hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

A strategy used by successful pay for performance agencies is to create multiple brands and landing pages to test different niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This also provides leverage, as an agency can easily switch to a competitor if a client attempts to renege on payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### AI Agents in Customer Service
[[business_models_in_ai_with_data_or_network_effect_advantages | AI]] agents represent a significant opportunity for performance-based models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These voice-based large language models (LLMs) can handle customer interactions such as setting appointments, taking calls, and managing rescheduling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. A company called Clara added 700 new [[business_models_in_ai_with_data_or_network_effect_advantages | AI]] agents, expecting to add $40 million in profit, handling 2.3 million chats 80-90% faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

Businesses can approach companies with large customer service teams and offer to save them money by implementing [[business_models_in_ai_with_data_or_network_effect_advantages | AI]] agents, taking a percentage of the cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Alternatively, a more direct approach is to focus on the value generated, such as acquiring more customers, and charge upfront for that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Starting with a percentage of cost savings can be a good de-risking strategy for an [[monetization_and_scaling_business_ideas | AI customer service agency]], with the potential to transition to a more value-based pricing model later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) Agencies
A pay for performance CRO agency, like Spiralytics in Atlanta, can significantly impact a client's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. If an e-commerce conversion rate is 1%, and the agency doubles it to 2%, they might take a 10% cut of the additional revenue generated (e.g., $2.5 million from $25 million in added revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Future Enablers: Smart Contracts
The future of pay for performance could be enhanced by smart contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. These blockchain-based contracts can automate payments based on predetermined performance metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. For example, if an agency hits certain numbers, funds held in escrow are automatically released to them; if not, the money returns to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This creates a transparent and fair system, eliminating anxiety and the risk of non-payment, which is a common issue for service providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Other Business Ideas and Principles

### Gamification of Life
Inspired by the concept of life as a game, there's an opportunity to gamify everyday tasks and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. An internal tool called "Incentive.ly" (a bought domain) successfully used micro-incentives in Solana (a cryptocurrency) to increase employee engagement with internal tools by 77% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This involved tracking tasks via APIs and rewarding completion or high ratings, creating leaderboards for motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

This concept can extend to personal life, such as using Apple Vision Pro to gamify chores like vacuuming by collecting virtual coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, or gamifying household tasks for spouses with micro-rewards (not necessarily money) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

### Rebranding Existing Products
There's significant opportunity in taking existing products and rebranding them for new markets or with improved messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. An example is the mouth tape business "Hostage Tape," which became successful through good messaging, storytelling, and branding, despite mouth tape existing previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Another idea is creating a better version of slippers, such as "anti-sweat slippers" made from bamboo, which is popular in Asian cultures, and introducing them to other markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

### Health and Longevity Services
The growing interest in health and longevity presents opportunities for new services. While traditional longevity practitioners can be expensive (e.g., $5,000 for blood work and supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>), there's a need for a more automated, user-friendly, and cost-effective solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. This could involve ongoing biometric scanning, [[business_models_in_ai_with_data_or_network_effect_advantages | AI]]-driven recommendations, and auto-ordering of discounted supplements or medications (e.g., via models like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. The focus on sleep and overall wellness is increasing, indicating a growing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

Another health idea is to improve night guards (used for teeth grinding) by making them less annoying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a> and incorporating teeth whitening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, potentially using sustainable materials to avoid microplastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. Combining this with sleep tape for nasal breathing could offer a comprehensive solution for sleep and oral health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

### Community-Focused Business Models
The demand for specific communities is high. While large organizations like EO and YPO exist, there's an opportunity to create specialized communities tailored to particular professional types (e.g., Dental Entrepreneurs Organization, Agency Owners Association) or demographics (e.g., Chief for women executives) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. These [[niche_website_business_models | niche communities]] are low-capital expenditure businesses, often requiring just a brand, landing page, and a specific vertical focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

## The Enduring Value of Agencies
Despite some perception of agencies as "boring businesses" that don't scale well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, they can be highly profitable and offer significant exit opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. An agency generating $5 million in EBITDA could be valued at 15-20x in a good market, potentially becoming a $100 million business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Agencies can also serve as powerful engines for incubating new software products and services, especially with [[business_models_in_ai_with_data_or_network_effect_advantages | AI]] making development more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

Opportunities within the agency space include:
*   [[business_models_in_ai_with_data_or_network_effect_advantages | AI]] transformation agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
*   [[business_models_in_ai_with_data_or_network_effect_advantages | AI]]-assisted content agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.
*   Programmatic SEO agencies, leveraging a current 1-2 year window of opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.
*   Creative agencies, as creative output becomes an increasing X-factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.

Pay for performance (PFP) is a business model where a service provider is compensated based on the measurable results they deliver, rather than a fixed fee or hourly rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This model is currently seen as an exciting startup opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.

## Why Pay for Performance is Exciting Now

The PFP model aligns the incentives of the service provider with the client's success, as the service provider only gets paid if they perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional marketing agencies that often charge upfront fees, even if results are not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. In an AI and data-rich world, marketers have more data, enabling them to underwrite opportunities and confidently bet on specific outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

Key advantages include:
*   **Reduced Client Risk**: Clients face no long-term commitment and only pay when results are achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **High Incentive for Performance**: Marketers are motivated to deliver tangible results because their compensation is directly tied to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **Low Capital Expenditures**: Setting up a PFP agency typically doesn't require significant initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Balanced Client Relationships**: If a client decides to discontinue service, the agency can simply move to a competitor, creating a more balanced power dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

## Examples of Pay for Performance Models

### Performance Marketing Agencies
A friend's PFP agency, focusing on a single industry, runs paid ads and excels in copywriting and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. They offer clients a trial period, running traffic and allowing the client to continue if they like the customers generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This agency generates $80 million annually with $30 million in profit and only 30 employees, demonstrating high scalability for an agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

Another example is a PFP agency focused on telecoms, which generates over a billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This agency initially drove leads through Google Ads and was paid per lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. As they grew, they began acquiring call centers to "gift wrap" customers for major telecoms like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

This model is similar to affiliate marketing, but it operates as actual businesses that adhere to ethical practices rather than engaging in "dirty ways" to secure conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

### Pay for Performance Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)
An agency called Spiralize in Atlanta operates as a PFP CRO agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. If an e-commerce conversion rate is 1% and the agency doubles it to 2%, they might take a percentage, such as 10% of the additional revenue generated (e.g., $2.5 million from an extra $25 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. This approach makes it easy for clients to agree as it's a fair "spread" based on measurable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

### AI Agents and Pay for Performance
AI agents represent a significant opportunity for PFP models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. For example, "retail AI" uses voice-based LLMs to handle tasks like scheduling dental appointments, demonstrating flawless interaction even when challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. These AI agents can take initial calls, set up follow-up calls, and manage rescheduling at scale for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

Clara, for instance, reported adding $40 million in profit by integrating 700 new AI agents that handle 2.3 million chats 80-90% faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

There's a significant opportunity to approach companies with large customer service teams and offer to save them money by implementing AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. This could involve taking a percentage of the cost savings (e.g., a percentage of $2 million saved per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. An alternative, and potentially more lucrative, approach is to "go straight for the value" by promising to get "X" more customers and charging upfront, which can capture four to eight times more value than focusing on cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

Starting with a percentage of cost savings can help de-risk the entrepreneur, potentially with a base cost to ensure client commitment and prevent non-payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.

## Ideal Industries for Pay for Performance

PFP models work best in industries where clients are willing to pay a high cost per acquisition (CPA) for leads or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Insurance**: A common space for PFP lead generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   **Finance**: Offers high potential for lead value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Crypto**: Many major exchanges are interested in PFP due to the significant money in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   **Hotels**: Another example where high CPAs might be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

It's crucial to focus on specific industries rather than broad categories like SaaS or AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

## Future of Pay for Performance: Smart Contracts

The future of PFP could involve smart contracts, although widespread adoption may still be 5-10 years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. Smart contracts, utilizing technologies like Chainlink, would automate agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

For instance, if an agency hits agreed-upon performance numbers, money held in escrow would be automatically released to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. If targets are not met by a specific deadline, the money would return to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. This creates a transparent and fair system, eliminating anxiety and the risk of non-payment, which is a common issue with traditional agency models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. This is where decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto become particularly interesting, as they eliminate the need for third-party trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

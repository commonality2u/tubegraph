Justin Mayers, founder of the nine-figure business Kettle and Fire, shares frameworks for conceiving and validating startup ideas without initial large-scale development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The discussion also touches on how these methods would evolve in 2025 with current technological advancements, particularly AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## Validating a Startup Idea: The Kettle and Fire Approach

The process for founding Kettle and Fire, a consumer packaged goods (CPG) business, involved several "day zero" steps to validate the concept before significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

### Step 1: Identify a Personal Problem and Market Interest

Justin began by considering starting his own company while working at Rackspace in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. He had heard about bone broth's health benefits (skin, gut, joint) from friends in the CrossFit community and noticed a lack of availability online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This personal interest and perceived gap formed the basis of his idea.

He aimed to answer two main questions:
1.  How many people want this product? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>
2.  Are there enough people willing to spend enough for a meaningful business? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>

To assess market interest, Justin researched niche communities like Mark's Daily Apple, PaleoHacks, and Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. He observed high engagement in threads discussing bone broth recipes, sourcing, and cooking methods, indicating a "small but fanatic" group of interested individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

He then used Google Trends to analyze the macro-level trajectory of bone broth, noting its upward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. At the time, his goal was modest: a business that could generate $10,000 a month in profit, requiring only a few thousand customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. He emphasized that this approach originated from solving his own problem and validating it with market data, rather than solely relying on trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

### Step 2: Validate Willingness to Pay Without a Product

The crucial next step was determining if people would pay enough to sustain a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

1.  **Minimal Viable Setup**: Justin purchased the cheapest bone broth-related domain name available ($9.99 for BoneBroths.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. He then paid $5 on Fiverr for a basic logo and renders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
2.  **Landing Page Development**: He created a landing page using Unbounce (a tool available in 2015) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. The page highlighted value propositions identified from Paleo forums, such as healing leaky gut, convenience (due to the long cooking time required for bone broth), and the use of organic, grass-fed ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.
3.  **Pricing Strategy**: Despite having no product or manufacturing plan, he set a price of $29.99 for 16 ounces, significantly higher than typical grocery store broth ($5 for 16 ounces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. The rationale was that if people paid six times more for a non-existent product from a "scam-like" landing page, it indicated strong demand and potential for profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.
4.  **Payment Flow**: The "Order Bone Broth Now" button directed users to Justin's personal PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
5.  **Advertising**: He spent approximately $50 on Bing Ads, which was cheaper than Google Ads at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

### Results and Post-Validation

Over a two-week test, despite a "janky" setup, the landing page achieved a 30% conversion rate (clicks on the order button) and generated nearly $500 in revenue from pre-orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. This validated the hypothesis that people would pay for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

After validation, Justin emailed every customer, explaining the product was not yet in stock and offering a full refund or a 50% discount for waiting. Most opted for the discount, further confirming strong customer interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. It took eight months to figure out how to actually make and scale the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.

## Building Startups in 2025: The Impact of AI

Justin reflects on how he would approach [building_and_scaling_tech_startups | building] Kettle and Fire differently in 2025, emphasizing the transformative role of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

### AI-Enhanced Validation and Development

*   **Improved Assets**: AI tools can generate significantly better landing pages and logos than were available in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.
*   **Sentiment Analysis**: AI can quickly scrape and analyze sentiment across Reddit, forums, and Twitter to gauge public opinion and interest in a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>.
*   **Core Principle Remains**: The fundamental strategy of trying to sell a product *before* it exists to validate demand remains critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. The goal is to get around 10 people to pay for the concept to quickly understand its viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.

### Opportunities for [ai_opportunities_for_startups | AI-Driven Startups]

AI significantly lowers the barriers to [building_a_successful_cpg_business | building CPG brands] and other ventures. What once required paying an agency tens of thousands of dollars for design can now be achieved with AI tools for a fraction of the cost, potentially as low as $200 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:00">[24:19:00]</a>.

*   **Democratization of Creation**: AI enables individuals ("one guy in a basement") to create products, especially in software, that were previously only possible for large teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. This reduces the need for extensive coordination among team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>.
*   **Rapid Prototyping**: Tools like Bolt.new and various AI models (Claude, GPT, Gemini) allow for the rapid creation of landing pages and product lines, making it possible to test dozens of startup ideas monthly and launch a startup in a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>.
*   **High Leverage**: Becoming a top 1% user of current AI tools is one of the highest leverage activities for future entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>.

### Choosing a Startup Focus: CPG vs. Software

Justin suggests that the choice between CPG and software is deeply personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. He advises founders to focus on problems they are genuinely passionate about and are "on the frontier" of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. His success in CPG (Kettle and Fire, Shirley Wine) stems from his deep interest in health and wellness, which allowed him to identify trends like bone broth, keto, and non-alcoholic beverages early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.

He emphasizes that success often comes from addressing significant real-world problems that ignite personal interest, rather than simply chasing profitable sectors like software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>. By continuously engaging with a problem, entrepreneurs can uncover new and interesting solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>. The key is to validate the market and understand pain points through community sentiment and data, which can now be distilled with greater ease using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>.

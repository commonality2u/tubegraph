The traditional marketing funnel is an "entirely wrong way to think about modern marketing" as it's deceptive and doesn't reflect how people actually buy products [00:00:07]. People interact with a brand, move away, get "sucked back in," rotate around it, and then "touch down" [00:01:22]. This process isn't linear like a funnel, where people enter at the top and come out the bottom [00:01:12]. Instead, it's about constant engagement and building influence over time [00:06:01].

## Digital Gravity: A New Marketing Paradigm
"Digital gravity" is a proposed new way to think about building a brand or company [00:00:21]. It suggests that a business builds "digital mass" on the internet [00:02:03]. The more mass a company has, the more influence it exerts within its niche or sphere [00:02:09]. This mass is primarily built through content and marketing everywhere the customer is present [00:02:14].

Imagine a customer as a comet flying by [00:03:18]. A small company has no influence over it [00:03:24]. However, the bigger a company gets and the more mass it builds, the more people get "sucked into that orbit" and get into rotation [00:03:34]. These rotations eventually lead to "touchdowns," which translate into revenue, creating a growth flywheel where revenue is reinvested to build more mass [00:03:44].

This concept applies to local businesses, B2B, and consumer markets [00:03:30]. Purchasing decisions often involve long cycles, with customers interacting with a brand over months or even years before buying [00:04:20]. Marketing should be a continuous process, not a series of start-and-stop campaigns, a term derived from military actions [00:05:32]. Continuous marketing, like running ads and testing constantly, shifts the mindset towards consistently adding "mass" to the company [00:06:07].

## Strategies for B2B Brand Promotion
For B2B companies, the approach involves a multi-layered strategy focused on building influence and consistent engagement.

### Audience Identification and Initial Outreach
The first step is to identify a smaller, specific target audience, often around 50,000 people [00:10:01].
1.  **Email Scraping**: Collect the emails of this target audience using tools like Apollo.io or even LinkedIn [00:10:08].
2.  **Custom Audience Ads**: Import these emails into ad platforms such as Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads to create custom match lists [00:10:53]. Typically, 30-40% of emails might be matched on platforms like Facebook Ads [00:11:03]. These ads should run indefinitely in the background [00:11:16].
3.  **[[aidriven_influencer_marketing | AI-Driven Ads]]**: Use [[strategies_for_building_a_brand_and_audience_with_ai_tools | AI tools]] like HeyGen for avatars and ElevenLabs for voice to create User-Generated Content (UGC) style ads [00:11:20]. Create many variations (e.g., 100) with different hooks, settings, backgrounds, and pain points [00:11:53]. The founder can also create a digital clone to appear in ads, leveraging their personal brand [00:11:31], as people buy from people, not brands [00:13:48]. The goal is to find the best-performing ads (lowest CPC) and allocate most of the budget there, while 20% remains for continuous testing [00:12:04].
4.  **Cold Email Campaigns**: Use tools like MailReef (for server management) [00:14:38] and Smartlead or Instantly AI (for sending) [00:14:56] to send cold emails to the same scraped list [00:14:29]. It's crucial to use separate domains for transactional, newsletter, and cold emails to prevent a compromised domain from affecting critical product functions [00:15:42]. Cold emails should mirror the ad messaging, focusing on problem-solution orientation [00:17:13]. Even if recipients don't respond immediately, they might see ads later and use the email as a search tool to find the company when they have a problem [00:17:38].

### Content and Media Creation
*   **Podcast Creation**: Convert customer conversations and feedback into a podcast [00:21:45]. This serves as valuable, educational content for the industry [00:22:57].
*   **Newsletter Distribution**: Send podcast episodes out via newsletters to the same email list [00:22:04], using services like MailerLite or Beehiiv [00:22:35]. This helps build a media company, creating leverage within the industry [00:23:11]. For example, Rupa Health used their podcast to gain negotiating power with large lab companies [00:23:16].
*   **Content Monetization**: The media arm can become a profit center by selling ad placements within the podcast and newsletter to relevant companies [00:24:09]. This can subsidize growth costs, effectively leading to "negative CAC" (Customer Acquisition Cost) [00:24:47].
*   **Content Repurposing**: Use [[strategies_for_building_a_brand_and_audience_with_ai_tools | AI tools]] like Swell AI to transcribe podcasts, extract pain points, create blog posts, white papers, and short-form video clips [00:27:52].
*   **Cross-Platform Distribution**: Schedule these clips across platforms where customers spend time, such as LinkedIn and Instagram [00:28:40]. Short-form content, even from TikTok or Instagram Reels, can go viral on LinkedIn [00:29:02].
*   **Instagram Growth through Ads**: Run Instagram-only ads focused on impressions, with a call to action in the caption to "follow this account for more content like this" [00:29:22]. This can significantly grow followers cheaply (e.g., 30 cents per follower) [00:29:57]. The goal is to get free impressions from a larger account, making the ad feel like content [00:30:23].

Companies like Aero Electronics, Red Bull, and Y Combinator operate as media companies, owning substantial content related to their industries [00:26:16]. Y Combinator, for instance, focuses heavily on YouTube content, leveraging founders' insights [00:27:05].

### The Power of Consistent, Layered Effort
This approach is about doing "a lot of different things simultaneously" that are "grindy" but not hard [00:31:59]. It requires trusting the process, as results might not be immediately visible [00:32:28]. For example, a company saw 10,000 clicks to their website per email send from a 130,000-subscriber list, generated over 18 months, at a fraction of the cost of traditional ads [00:32:44]. This consistent effort builds "mental real estate" in the customer's mind, making it hard for competitors to dislodge the brand [00:36:48].

## Strategies for Consumer Brand Promotion
Consumer marketing is highly competitive and requires exceptional marketing skills [00:39:13].

### Core Principles for Consumer Apps
*   **Large Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: A huge TAM is essential because content needs to be broad enough to target a large subset of the population [00:39:57].
*   **Focused Application**: Consumer apps that do one thing well tend to succeed [00:41:28].
*   **Pricing Strategy**: Charging a monthly or weekly impulse purchase price (e.g., $7.99/week translating to $29/month) can generate three months of revenue, offering a good return on a low Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) [00:41:34].

### [[using_social_media_for_app_growth | Leveraging Social Media for App Growth]]
1.  **Paid Ads**: Run conversion-focused ads on platforms like Facebook Ads and TikTok Ads, optimized for app installs or specific in-app actions (e.g., sign-up, paid action) [00:42:04]. Test many variations to find the most effective ones [00:42:25].
2.  **[[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_apps | Influencer Marketing Strategies for Apps]] (UGC Creators)**: Hire UGC creators (e.g., 5-10) who can produce daily video content and cross-post it [00:42:36]. These creators act as a testbed to find content types most likely to go viral [00:42:55]. The content should focus on a hook, pain point, and the product as the hero [00:43:05]. The goal is to create ads that feel like native content, offering entertainment and education [00:43:15].
3.  **Multi-Account Strategy**: Spin up multiple (e.g., 10) TikTok accounts [00:43:42]. Remix the best-performing UGC content using [[strategies_for_building_a_brand_and_audience_with_ai_tools | AI tools]] like ChatGPT for scripts, HeyGen for videos, and ElevenLabs for audio [00:43:49]. Use CapCut for green screen removal to place the app background behind an AI avatar [00:44:08].
4.  **Unique Product Name**: Choose a product name that avoids competition on Google's front page [00:44:29].
5.  **Website Pixel Installation**: Install Facebook, TikTok, and Google pixels on the product website [00:44:43]. This allows for indefinite retargeting of users who touch the website, building a larger audience for remarketing campaigns [00:45:01].
6.  **Email Nurture**: Capture emails on the website for a nurture sequence that upsells the product [00:45:47].

### [[influencer_marketing_strategies | Influencer Marketing Strategies]] at Scale
*   **Outreach to YouTube Creators**: Scrape contact emails from YouTube channels within the product category [00:46:20]. Send cold emails to inquire about pricing [00:46:54].
*   **Arbitrage in Pricing**: Analyze influencer pricing versus average views to identify discrepancies (an "imperfect market") [00:47:14]. This allows for arbitrage opportunities to work with creators at a discounted CPM (Cost Per Mille) compared to traditional ad buying [00:49:51].
*   **Deal Structure**: A common successful deal structure is a three-video package (e.g., $1,500) combined with a recurring affiliate commission (e.g., 30%) [00:47:34]. This creates stickiness, as creators earn significant recurring revenue, making it difficult for competitors to poach them [00:48:11].
*   **Instagram & TikTok Outreach**: Use tools like IGLeads.io to scrape emails from Instagram accounts based on hashtags or keywords [00:48:51], and apply similar bulk outreach strategies for TikTok [00:49:03].

### Programmatic SEO for Consumer Products
*   **Target Longtail Keywords**: As the app's website gains Domain Authority (trust measured by backlinks) [00:50:30], it can rank for lower-competition, longtail keywords (e.g., "how to lose weight," "calorie counts") [00:51:19].
*   **AI-Powered Content Generation**: Scrape top-ranking content for target keywords, create blog post outlines using [[strategies_for_building_a_brand_and_audience_with_ai_tools | AI tools]], and write articles section by section for quality [00:51:29]. Aggressively publish thousands of articles, and once a page gets traffic, have a human SEO specialist refine it [00:52:19].
*   **Call to Action**: Integrate calls to action for app sign-ups within the first paragraph and strategically throughout the content (e.g., within every scroll frame, pop-ups at 25-50% scroll rate) [00:53:24].
*   **Pixel Integration**: Ensure these content pages also pixel visitors, adding them to the remarketing funnel [00:54:01].

PJ, known for his viral [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI films]] on X (formerly Twitter) with some posts receiving hundreds of thousands of likes, shares his process for generating engaging, monetizable content using Google V3 and [[automating_content_creation_with_ai | ChatGPT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This guide outlines his approach from ideation to monetization.

## The Process: From Idea to Viral Video

PJ's method for creating viral [[leveraging_ai_for_ad_creation_and_iteration | AI-generated ads]] and content involves several key steps, emphasizing not just technical execution but understanding audience engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### 1. Ideation: The Hook is Key
The first step is to develop a unique idea or "kernel of an idea hook" that is unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This often involves taking a common concept and adding a satirical or surprising twist.

*   **Example: The Pharmaceutical Commercial**
    *   The initial idea for a pharmaceutical commercial became unique when PJ considered a placebo pill that led to a puppy delivery, evolving into a pill secreting pheromones that attract puppies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
    *   This "unhinged" twist transformed a potentially "cinematic blas√© garbage" commercial into something with soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### 2. Scripting with [[automating_content_creation_with_ai | ChatGPT]]
[[automating_content_creation_with_ai | ChatGPT]] serves as a crucial tool for script generation and refinement.

*   **Initial Prompts**: Start with generalized instructions to get a cliche script, then tear it apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
    *   **Example Prompt**: "Give me four scripts for a standard pharmaceutical commercial for the presentation for a fake medication that solves depression by taking a pill that's a play on words that includes 'pup' in the name and it sounds like a real medication. The commercial follows the same format or structure of a 20 or so second prescription commercial. Starts off like it's people battling depression for the first 10 seconds. Few different speakers. 'Nothing worked.' And then they tried the pup name. It's a pill you take in three to five business days. A puppy gets delivered to your house. It completely solved their depression. Maybe the ending bit is try like a jet ski thing. Commercial is kind of an SNL style satirical take on the standard drug commercial and I like it. Give me four prompt versions..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
*   **Refining for Humor**: Prompt [[automating_content_creation_with_ai | ChatGPT]] for comedic examples and "zingers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Feed your favorite lines back into the model to help it learn and update its style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
    *   Around 70% of the lines in PJ's pharmaceutical commercial were generated by [[automating_content_creation_with_ai | ChatGPT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
    *   **Tip**: To outsource "taste," instruct [[automating_content_creation_with_ai | ChatGPT]] to create jokes in the style of a specific comedian or show (e.g., Seth Rogen, Bill Burr, SNL's Deep Thoughts with Jack Handy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
*   **Leverage Multiple LLMs**: Don't just use [[automating_content_creation_with_ai | ChatGPT]]; experiment with other models like Claude or Grok's "unhinged mode" for different outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### 3. Generating Video with Google V3
Once the script is refined, break it down into shot-by-shot prompts for Google V3.

*   **Prompt Structure**: While complicated prompts are not strictly necessary, describe what's happening, the dialogue, character details (e.g., age, appearance, emotion), pose, shot type, camera type, and background details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
    *   **Tip**: Avoid using quotes in prompts to reduce the likelihood of generating weird gibberish subtitles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.
*   **Cost and Iteration**: Google V3 costs about $2 to $3 per shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. PJ runs shots one at a time to get feedback and adjust prompts, often going back and forth with [[automating_content_creation_with_ai | ChatGPT]] to refine descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
    *   The pharmaceutical commercial, which was 10-12 shots, cost around $500 in V3 credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.
*   **Audio and Consistency**: Google V3 generates audio automatically with the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. However, audio quality can be "thin" and character voices lack consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.
*   **Character Consistency**: There is no automatic character consistency in Google V3 (text-to-video only, not image-to-video for consistency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. To achieve a similar look, describe characters in extreme detail consistently across prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.
*   **Camera Movements**: Prompt specific camera movements (e.g., "camera push in" or "dolly in") to make shots feel less [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI-generated]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

### 4. Editing and Post-Production
*   **Software**: PJ uses Final Cut Pro, but recommends Cap Cut as a free, equally good option for beginners, and Da Vinci Resolve for those wanting more advanced features without cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
*   **Shot Selection**: Expect a low ratio of usable shots to generated shots. PJ generated about 30 clips to get 10 good ones, a 5:1 ratio if including bad ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

### 5. Crafting the Hook for X
After creating the video, the crucial step for virality, especially on platforms like X, is crafting a compelling headline or hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.

*   **Mr. Beast's Philosophy**: The title is more important than the thumbnail, which is more important than the content itself, because without the initial hook, the content won't be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
*   **Elements of a Strong Hook**:
    *   **Flex/Credibility**: Establish expertise (e.g., "I used to shoot $500k pharmaceutical commercials") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.
    *   **Value Proposition/Cost Comparison**: Highlight the significant reduction in cost or effort using [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] (e.g., "I made this for $500 in V3 credits in less than a day") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.
    *   **Symmetry**: Use numerical symmetry for impact (e.g., $500k to $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
    *   **Questions**: Questions engage the audience and encourage replies, feeding the algorithm (e.g., "What's the argument for spending 500K now?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
    *   **Call to Value**: Encourage clicks by offering valuable takeaways (e.g., "Steal my prompt below") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
    *   **Provocative Statements**: Use phrases that capture attention without being generic clickbait (e.g., "AI video quality just 10xed overnight," "This is my most unhinged video I've made") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

## [[Monetizing content creation through AI | Monetizing Content Creation with AI]]

PJ outlines several ways to build a business around [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | generative AI]] content:

1.  **Build a Personal Brand**: Use Google V3 to create content you're proud of, leading to downstream work and establishing yourself in the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
2.  **Attract Direct Clients**: Create specific types of commercials (e.g., food products, CPG brands, underwear) for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Brands are willing to pay for "unhinged special effects shots" that traditional agencies cannot deliver on budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. Charge anywhere from $5,000 for content, recognizing the value of your filmmaking skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.
3.  **Build a Portfolio for Agencies**: Create a specialized portfolio, focusing on a niche that interests you (e.g., knife commercials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.
    *   **Copying the Greats**: "Good artist copy, great artist steal." Analyze award-winning commercials, break them down into prompts using [[automating_content_creation_with_ai | ChatGPT]], and recreate the shots with Google V3 for a different, adjacent product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. This helps level up filmmaking and editing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.
4.  **Create Narrative Series with Brand Integrations**: Develop a consistent narrative universe (e.g., Neural Viz's "moniverse" featuring aliens exploring human artifacts) and integrate products into the story organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>. This allows for monetization through brand partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.
    *   **Adapt Popular Formats**: Find trending social formats (e.g., "man on the street" interviews, Zillow-style home tours) and add an [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI-driven]] twist (e.g., aliens instead of humans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.
5.  **Sell Courses/Digital Products**: Bundle up your knowledge and sell it as a course, PDF, or other digital product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.
6.  **Consulting with Larger Companies**: Offer services to Fortune 500 and other companies on integrating [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | generative AI]] while maintaining legal compliance and security procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.
    *   **Pricing Tip**: Charge based on the scale of the company; bigger companies pay more for the same content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
7.  **Build a Sketch Comedy Channel**: While harder to monetize directly, a large audience on platforms like TikTok can lead to brand integrations within comedy bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
8.  **Narrative Films (with caution)**: Long-form narrative films (e.g., 90-minute features) are generally not recommended for [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | generative AI]] due to rapid iteration in the space and potential for inconsistent quality from beginning to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Episodic Content**: Prioritize creating episodic weekly content, which aligns with modern consumption habits and requires smaller budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.
9.  **Pitch Brands on Narrative Content**: Propose creating episodic narrative series specifically tailored to a brand, featuring their products as "relics and artifacts" within the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.
10. **Pick a Small Sub-Niche**: Target niches with low supply of content and high demand.
    *   **Example: Bible Content**: Stories from the Bible offer open-sourced IP with a vast, engaged audience (2 billion daily active users) and high demand for faith-based content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.
    *   **Example: Book Promos**: The "BookTok" or "Romantasy" communities on social media offer a huge opportunity to create book promos or scenes from books for authors, who would pay well for marketing materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

## Final Advice

*   **Follow Your Fascination**: Create content based on what genuinely interests you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
*   **Copy Frameworks**: Apply successful content frameworks and adapt them to your unique niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>.
*   **Embrace Your "Weirdness"**: Lean into your own unique interests and quirks to find underserved niches and productize your point of view into entertaining brand work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.

The ability to create high-quality, engaging content with [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] tools like Google V3 opens doors for individual creators to compete with large agencies and build profitable businesses, especially by targeting underserved niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>.

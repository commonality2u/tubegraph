While direct monetization of custom GPTs is not yet widely observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, potential strategies are emerging, particularly through [[monetizing_leads_and_creating_revenue_streams|lead generation]] and the use of specialized data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

## Prerequisites for Monetization
For a custom GPT to be a viable business, it needs to offer something that cannot be easily replicated by general [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content|ChatGPT]] or Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. This means the custom GPT must leverage specialized data that other platforms do not have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

## Lead Generation as a Monetization Strategy
One interesting avenue for [[monetizing_ai_applications_and_new_media_formats|monetizing AI applications]] like custom GPTs is through [[monetizing_leads_and_creating_revenue_streams|lead generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

### Example: Legal GPTs
A lawyer reportedly owns many top legal GPTs, using them as a lead generation tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. When users prompt these GPTs for legal assistance, such as needing a contract, the lawyer reaches out to offer their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. This approach leverages the high demand for [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content|AI-generated content]] in specific niches to acquire potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

## Other Potential Monetization Strategies
Similar to how other creators monetize their content, custom GPTs could potentially use:
*   Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>
*   Affiliates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>
*   Their own products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>

The [[monetizing_leads_and_creating_revenue_streams|lead generation]] mechanism is considered equally interesting and applicable across many topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

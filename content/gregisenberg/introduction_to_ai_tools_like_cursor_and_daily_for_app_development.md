The landscape of app development is being transformed by Artificial Intelligence (AI), enabling the creation of innovative applications, particularly "character apps" or voice chat apps, that can be built rapidly by both technical and non-technical individuals alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These AI-powered characters are emerging as a new form of application, offering significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This guide introduces key AI tools and concepts for building such applications.

## Key AI Tools for App Development

### [[building_ai_apps_with_cursor | Cursor AI]]
[[building_ai_apps_with_cursor | Cursor AI]] is a code editor that integrates with Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist with coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. It's a useful tool for developers in the AI space.

### Daily
Daily is highlighted as a primary tool for handling the heavy lifting involved in voice and backend processing for AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Daily Bots**: Daily's "Daily Bots" functionality simplifies the process by handling LLM calls directly, allowing developers to focus on configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Pip Cats**: Prior to Daily Bots, Daily offered the Pip Cats library, which was more developer-focused and made it easier to interface with AI for building voice assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For projects requiring more control, Pip Cats might still be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.

### Ease of Use
Setting up a voice AI app with Daily is straightforward:
1.  Sign up for Daily and obtain an API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
2.  Clone their demo repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
3.  Paste the API key into a local file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
4.  Run a single command (`yarn Dev`) to start the server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

This process requires no initial coding; it's primarily about downloading and configuring existing resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## The Architecture of Voice AI Apps
Daily's system manages a complex pipeline for voice AI interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>:
1.  **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Audio input from a microphone is converted into text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
2.  **LLM Processing**: This text is then fed into an LLM (e.g., Llama 3.1 70B via Together AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
3.  **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: The LLM's text response is converted back into speech using a TTS provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
4.  **Audio Output**: The generated speech is streamed to the user's browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

Daily abstracts away the complexities of performance and error handling in this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, allowing developers to focus on the character's behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Configuring Voice Characters
The core of a voice AI app lies in configuring its character and personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Prompts**: The behavior of the bot is primarily defined in a configuration file using prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This includes instructions on how the bot should speak for correct audio output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Customization**: Users can edit this file to create their own custom characters, beyond the default options like "Gen Z middle schooler" or "skateboard meme guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Characters as New Apps**: The concept of "characters as the new apps" presents a significant opportunity for ideation and launching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Observations show that AI character chat apps have strong retention, indicating they are not just a fad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. This applies to both B2B and B2C applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Function Calling (Tool Calling)
Function calling allows an LLM to interact with external systems and perform actions beyond just generating text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: While LLMs only output text, a system built around them can interpret specific text formats as instructions to call external functions (e.g., APIs, getting data, making a social media post) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Daily's backend is designed to recognize and execute these function calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Example: Weather Man**: A "weather man" character can be created to provide weather reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
    *   This involves defining a `get_weather` tool for the LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
    *   Parameters like `location` can be specified for the function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
    *   The LLM must be instructed to respond in a specific format that Daily understands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
    *   The `get_weather` function in the application's code (e.g., in Next.js API routes) then executes the actual logic, like fetching weather data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **"Nonsense Phenomena" for Virality**: Integrating unusual or humorous responses (like "whimsical singing rainbows" or "flying pigs") can serve as a validation mechanism for function calls and potentially go viral, driving free distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

## Deployment
Once an application is developed, it can be easily deployed to be live on the internet.
*   **Vercel**: For Next.js applications, Vercel is a platform that simplifies hosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.
*   **One-Command Deployment**: After logging in and connecting to a Vercel account, an app can be deployed with a single command (`vercel`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.

## Real-World Application: Vtuber Call App
A more advanced example of a voice AI application is a "FaceTime call with a Vtuber" app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.
*   **Vtubers**: Vtubers are content creators who use software to embody virtual avatars, often anime characters, instead of their real faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. They are extremely popular, with millions of followers and significant earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.
*   **App Concept**: This app leverages voice APIs to allow users to have a personal video call with an AI-powered Vtuber character, addressing the lack of direct interaction with real Vtuber influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.
*   **Implementation**: This particular app uses Pip Cats for more developer control, and the Vtuber models can be purchased from marketplaces like Booth (Nzima) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.

## Conclusion
The current age of AI provides powerful tools that make [[building_apps_with_ai_tools | app development]], especially for voice-controlled "character" applications, incredibly accessible and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Even without extensive coding knowledge, individuals can quickly spin up engaging applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The focus shifts from complex low-level coding to configuring and iterating on existing frameworks, allowing for rapid iteration and the creation of unique, viral experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. This represents a significant leap in [[the_potential_of_ai_in_app_development | app development potential]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

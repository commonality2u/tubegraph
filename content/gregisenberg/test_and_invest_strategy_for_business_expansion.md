The [[Test and Invest strategy for business growth | Test and Invest]] framework is a method for business expansion that prioritizes experimentation with a portion of resources before committing to large-scale investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>. It is particularly useful for identifying and scaling profitable growth channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:17]</a>.

## Core Principle: The 80/20 Rule
For marketing channels and general business expansion, the [[Test and Invest strategy for business growth | Test and Invest]] strategy advises allocating resources based on an 80/20 rule, similar to an investment thesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>:
*   **80% in "Index Funds"**: This portion of resources (money, time, people) should be dedicated to established channels that consistently deliver results year over year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.
*   **20% for Experimentation ("Rocket Ship" Potential)**: The remaining 20% should be used for testing new marketing channels or innovative ideas that have the potential to become significant future growth drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>. This ensures the business is not reliant on a single channel and has backups if one fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>.

## Application and Examples

### Prioritizing Retention Before Growth
A common mistake founders make is rushing into growth before establishing strong retention. The [[Test and Invest strategy for business growth | Test and Invest]] approach suggests focusing on customer loyalty first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>. If the business has excellent customer loyalty (measured by net revenue retention), it can then "throw gasoline on that fire" with promotion strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>. This is analogous to not building a "leaky ship" that loses revenue quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>.

### Identifying Ideal Customers and Expanding Offerings
A key step in the [[Framework for assessing and launching a startup idea | nine steps to nine figures]] framework is "Persona" – deeply understanding who the business sells to, who loves it, and who sends referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:00">[37:52:00]</a>. By analyzing customer data, businesses can identify trends among their top customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:10:00">[38:10:00]</a>.

An example from AppSumo illustrates this:
1.  **Identify Persona**: In 2017, AppSumo analyzed its customer data and found that over 80% of its top customers were marketing agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:22:00">[38:22:00]</a>. These agencies were using AppSumo to reduce their monthly software expenses, which was crucial due to the feast-or-famine nature of agency revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>.
2.  **Test a Hypothesis**: AppSumo was doing one software deal a quarter. The hypothesis was: what if they did one software deal a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:00">[39:00:00]</a>?
3.  **Experiment (Test)**: They tried doing one deal a month for a quarter. Revenue increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>.
4.  **Scale (Invest)**: Based on the positive results, they incrementally increased the frequency to two, three, and then four deals a month, eventually reaching one software lifetime deal every single day (30 a month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:14:00">[39:14:00]</a>.
5.  **Outcome**: By selling more of what their ideal customer wanted, customer loyalty and referrals increased, customer lifetime value tripled, and customer acquisition costs were slashed, leading to the overall business tripling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:30:00">[39:30:00]</a>.

### Testing Referral and Affiliate Models
The [[Test and Invest strategy for business growth | Test and Invest]] strategy can also be applied to revenue channels, like referral programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24:00">[40:24:00]</a>.
1.  **Hypothesis**: If customers share their referral link, would they share more if they were paid cash instead of receiving credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:36:00">[40:36:00]</a>?
2.  **Experiment**: AppSumo manually emailed their top 10,000 sharers and offered PayPal payments for referrals for one month. This was done manually with a spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:42:00">[40:42:00]</a>.
3.  **Results and Investment**: The data showed a marked increase in sharing. This justified investing in proper tracking software to launch a full affiliate program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:05:00">[41:05:00]</a>.
4.  **Outcome**: The affiliate program became a revenue channel generating multiple eight figures for AppSumo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:16:00">[41:16:00]</a>.

## Founder's Role in [[Test and Invest strategy for business growth | Test and Invest]]
The founder's primary role is to "dig for oil" – to discover new revenue streams or opportunities through testing and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:35:00">[41:35:00]</a>. It is then the responsibility of the team (or new hires) to "scale it" once the discovery has proven successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:49:00">[41:49:00]</a>. Hiring to discover revenue is a common mistake; founders should hire to scale revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:47:00">[41:47:00]</a>.

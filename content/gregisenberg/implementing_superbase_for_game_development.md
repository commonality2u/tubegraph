[[superbase_integration_for_saas_projects|Superbase]] can be integrated into games to store important data like high scores and email addresses, making it a valuable tool for growth hacking and audience engagement. It is considered an easy-to-use database for beginners due to its simplicity and affordability, even offering a free version suitable for thousands of users in experimental or starting projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Many newer micro-SaaS applications utilize [[superbase_integration_for_saas_projects|Superbase]] for its cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.

## Benefits of Superbase Integration for Games

Integrating a [[superbase_integration_for_saas_projects|Superbase]] leaderboard into a game significantly enhances engagement and virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. It adds a competitive element, encouraging players to return and improve their scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. Beyond competition, it serves as a powerful lead generation tool, allowing developers to collect email addresses for newsletters or marketing lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

## Implementation Plan

The general plan for implementing [[superbase_integration_for_saas_projects|Superbase]] involves:
1.  Setting up [[superbase_integration_for_saas_projects|Superbase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.
2.  Making necessary game UI changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.
3.  Integrating the leaderboard backend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>.
4.  Designing the visual aspect of the leaderboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.

Additional features that can be integrated include:
*   A "Share to X" button for direct score posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>.
*   Toggle functionality for weekly or all-time scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>.
*   Verification mechanisms to ensure fair play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

### 1. Set Up Superbase Account and Project
*   Go to `superbase.com` and sign up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.
*   Create a new project (e.g., "Space Game") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.
*   Set a strong password for your project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.

### 2. Configure Database Schema
[[superbase_integration_for_saas_projects|Superbase]] is a SQL database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. To set up the leaderboard, you'll need to run specific SQL commands in the [[superbase_integration_for_saas_projects|Superbase]] SQL editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>. These commands typically include:
*   **Creating the leaderboard table:** This table will store player scores and associated emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>. An example command would create fields like `id`, `created_at`, `email`, and `score`.
*   **Creating an index:** This optimizes queries for faster retrieval of scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.
*   **Adding security policies (Row Level Security - RLS):**
    *   Allowing authenticated users to insert scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.
    *   Allowing anyone to read scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.

### 3. Retrieve API Credentials
*   Navigate to your Project Settings in [[superbase_integration_for_saas_projects|Superbase]], then select the "API" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>.
*   Copy your Project URL and the `anon` (public) API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>.

### 4. Integrate Superbase into Game Code (e.g., with Cursor)
*   Add the [[superbase_integration_for_saas_projects|Superbase]] library to your game's project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
*   Create a [[superbase_integration_for_saas_projects|Superbase]] configuration file (e.g., `superbase_config.js`) to store your API keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.
*   Replace placeholder API keys in this configuration file with the credentials copied from your [[superbase_integration_for_saas_projects|Superbase]] project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.
*   Update your main game JavaScript file (e.g., `sketch.js`) to include the [[superbase_integration_for_saas_projects|Superbase]] client initialization and integrate the leaderboard functionality. This includes:
    *   Displaying an input field for email and score submission when the game ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
    *   Handling score submission to [[superbase_integration_for_saas_projects|Superbase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>.
    *   Displaying the leaderboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.

### 5. Debugging Common Issues
AI tools like Cursor can help debug issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>. For example, if the game's input doesn't work after adding [[superbase_integration_for_saas_projects|Superbase]], it might be because the game's event listeners are intercepting keyboard or mouse events, preventing them from reaching the input fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>. The AI can suggest fixes to ensure proper input field functionality and prevent interference from game-related event capturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.

### 6. Deploy the Game
*   **GitHub Pages:** A straightforward method to deploy the game live on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.
    *   Initialize a Git repository and commit your game files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.
    *   Create a new public repository on GitHub (without a README) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>.
    *   Push your local code to the GitHub repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>.
    *   In GitHub repository settings, go to "Pages" and set the source branch (e.g., `main`) for deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>.
    *   After a few minutes, the game will be live at the provided GitHub Pages URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.

With the game live, you can then share the URL on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) to drive traffic and collect emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>.

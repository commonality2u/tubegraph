Growing AI applications successfully hinges on two critical pillars: a strong product and effective growth strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. While creating a completely new AI app idea is challenging, a more accessible approach is to integrate AI "sizzle" into existing popular app concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Artificial intelligence can significantly aid both product development (e.g., learning to code with tools like ChatGPT) and scaling growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

There are three main ways to grow a mobile app:
1.  **App Store Optimization (ASO)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>
2.  **Paid Ads** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>
3.  **Organic Viral Marketing (Product-Led Growth)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>

This article will focus on the first two strategies: ASO and Paid Ads.

## App Store Optimization (ASO)

ASO is the practice of ranking highly when users search for a keyword in the App Store, similar to [[seo_strategies_for_ai_startups | Search Engine Optimization]] for websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

### Key Principles of ASO

*   **Keyword Identification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>: The main challenge is finding keywords that have sufficient search volume but low competition. An example is a text-to-speech app that grew quickly because there was demand for such functionality on mobile but no existing apps in the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.
*   **Targeting Existing Demand** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>: ASO primarily captures demand from users who are already actively searching for a specific solution. This differs from other marketing forms that might create demand.
*   **Leveraging Trends** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>: Identifying emerging trends outside the App Store (e.g., via Google Trends, Glimpse, Reddit, TikTok) can reveal new keyword opportunities. For instance, the "looksmaxing" trend on Reddit and TikTok inspired the Umax app, which was not initially identified via App Store keyword research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Naming** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>: Including relevant keywords in the app's title is crucial for ASO.
*   **Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>: Ensuring that when people visit your app's page, they download it. Apple interprets high conversion rates as a sign of good traffic and relevance.
*   **Reviews and Growth Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>: A higher number of positive reviews and consistent growth are important factors for ASO.
*   **Launch Strategy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>: The first day an app launches is critical, as Apple provides an initial boost. A high conversion rate during this period can create a positive flywheel effect for sustained downloads and high rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>.
*   **Supporting with Paid Ads** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>: Running paid ads can indirectly boost ASO by generating more traffic and reviews, which signals to Apple that the app is popular and relevant, leading to improved organic rankings.

### Example: Remone Holding

Remone Holding is a company that excels at ASO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. They identify niche, less competitive keywords like "fan noise," "green noise," or "anime girlfriend AI," and develop simple apps to capture that specific search demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>. They often re-use the same technology or ideas across multiple apps, adapting them for different keywords or audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>.

> "They look at what people are searching on the App Store and capturing that demand with a title probably that's a little more interesting than you know maybe what else is out there." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>

## Paid Ads for AI Apps

Paid advertising, particularly on platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and Google Ads, is a powerful strategy for driving app growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

### The Role of AI in Paid Ad Strategies

AI has revolutionized the process of creating and scaling ads, making it more accessible and efficient for app developers.

*   **Massive Creative Testing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:27:00">[37:27:00]</a>: Successful paid ad campaigns require testing hundreds, if not thousands, of ad creatives to find winning formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:32:00">[39:32:00]</a>. Historically, this was extremely costly, but AI makes it significantly less expensive and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:43:00">[39:43:00]</a>.
*   **AI-Generated Ad Content** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:41:00">[38:41:00]</a>: AI tools allow creators to generate entire ads from a computer, eliminating the need for actors or elaborate production. This involves using AI for scripting, text-to-speech (e.g., Eleven Labs), and video editing with user-friendly tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>.
*   **Rapid Iteration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:39:00">[41:39:00]</a>: Developers can quickly generate multiple versions of an ad (e.g., 20 in an hour), test them, and iterate on the ones that perform best.

### Example: PictureThis (Plant Identifier App)

PictureThis, a plant identifier app, generates approximately $7 million in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:33:00">[34:33:00]</a>. The app leverages AI to make the core functionality, like identifying plants from a photo, highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:33:00">[35:33:00]</a>. Its success is heavily attributed to its extensive paid ad strategy, having tested around 30,000 different video creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>.

> "AI just made the product work... there were a lot of apps where you can take a picture but they just didn't work before AI." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:25:00">[36:25:00]</a>

### Localization and Niche Targeting

*   **Global Expansion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>: Once an ad concept proves successful in one market (e.g., the US), AI tools can easily localize the ad content into different languages (e.g., French, Spanish) and adapt it for various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:07:00">[43:07:00]</a>.
*   **Hyper-Niche Apps** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:46:00">[45:46:00]</a>: Another powerful [[marketing_and_monetization_strategies_for_ai_products | marketing and monetization strategy]] is taking a proven app idea and niching it down for a specific audience or country. Examples include:
    *   A weight loss app specifically for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:47:00">[45:47:00]</a>.
    *   Dating apps tailored for specific demographics (e.g., Latinos, gay people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:02:00">[46:02:00]</a>.
    *   A "Bible for Women" app, branching off a popular general Bible chat app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:36:00">[46:36:00]</a>.

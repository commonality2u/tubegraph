Before investing significant time into a Vertical SaaS venture, it is crucial to thoroughly understand and be comfortable with the go-to-market strategy for the chosen industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>. A great product without users is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

## Understanding Industry Distribution

To gain insight into effective distribution, it's beneficial to study how successful Vertical SaaS companies in that specific space have scaled their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. One can leverage AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT to research how these companies acquired their initial 10, 100, or 1,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

### Challenges in Vertical SaaS Go-to-Market

Go-to-market can be particularly challenging in many Vertical SaaS industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>:
*   **Heavy Outside Sales Models** Many industries historically rely on "country clubby," relationship-based sales, requiring in-person meetings and handshake deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>. This contrasts with typical [[growth_marketing_strategies_for_startups | product-led growth]] where users are acquired through online channels like Product Hunt or email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.
*   **Venture Capital Preference** Venture Capital firms often prefer to invest in companies with product-led or marketing-led customer acquisition strategies because they are generally faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. For sales-led publicly traded companies, achieving significant scale typically requires substantial Average Contract Values (ACVs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. If the goal is rapid growth, it's important to identify industries where customer acquisition can occur through product-led or marketing-led approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.

### Importance of Industry-Specific Research

It's vital to research and determine how customer acquisition works within a specific industry, including the potential for media building or social media engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. While understanding past successful methods is important, ambitious founders can also innovate and introduce new approaches like creating industry-specific newsletters or meme-based email campaigns to engage the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>.

### Leveraging [[importance_of_wedge_products_in_vertical_saas | Wedge Products]]

A [[importance_of_wedge_products_in_vertical_saas | wedge product]] serves as an entry point into an industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>. Instead of launching an all-in-one solution, which can take years and significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>, a wedge product focuses on a specific, poorly handled but crucial aspect of the customer's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.

**Characteristics of a Good Wedge Product:**
*   Addresses a problem often handled manually or by inferior competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   Easy to implement and deploy quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
*   Acts as a "reputation prover," demonstrating value and building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, which is easier than acquiring a completely new customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.
*   Ideally, can be marketing-led in its acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.

**Example: Roofr.com**
Roofr.com, a software company for roofing businesses, started with a proposal tool that used Google Maps to provide real-time quotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. This tool was free to roofing companies, taking a percentage of the booking only upon successful customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. This allowed them to acquire customers digitally, an unheard-of feat in the typically sales-heavy home services industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>. After establishing trust, they then launched a CRM and plan to expand to an all-in-one solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

### Incorporating Payments

Integrating payments into a Vertical SaaS solution is a powerful way to scale the business significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. Owning the transaction greatly expands the total addressable market beyond just software subscription fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>. For example, Toast, a restaurant software company, transitioned from a subscription-based model to one that took a percentage of every transaction, drastically increasing their market size from millions to trillions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. If a [[importance_of_wedge_products_in_vertical_saas | wedge product]] can be built either before or after the transaction, it creates an opportunity to eventually capture the transaction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>.

The business landscape often sees trends emerge, but it's important to recognize that an [[antitrends_for_startups | anti-trend]] often arises simultaneously, presenting unique and potentially lucrative startup opportunities. Some of the most compelling startup ideas can stem from identifying and capitalizing on these opposing currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## Identifying Antitrends

For every significant trend, an opposing anti-trend is likely to develop. Businesses can strategically position themselves within these anti-trends to cater to different market segments.

### AI-Powered Coaching vs. Human-Led Services

The proliferation of AI-powered coaching and texting applications, such as the `Plug AI` and `Riz` apps, which leverage large language models like ChatGPT for dating advice and life coaching, exemplifies a strong trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. These [[examples_of_profitable_ai_app_business_models | profitable AI app business models]] demonstrate high revenue potential, with `Plug AI` alone reportedly generating $190,000 per month and a development studio claiming nearly $500,000 in monthly revenue across three AI-powered apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

However, an anti-trend suggests an equally significant demand for human-led services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Businesses can capitalize on this by:
*   **Offering Premium Human Alternatives**: Charging a premium for human-led coaching or personalized assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. For example, the developer of `Riz` could offer a premium upgrade featuring human coaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **Creating "Human Versions" of AI Apps**: Launching services that replicate the functionality of AI apps but are driven by human experts or influencers, such as a "human version" of an AI style and makeup palette app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. This highlights [[the_potential_of_combining_digital_tools_with_traditional_business_models | the potential of combining digital tools with traditional business models]].

### Longevity and Biohacking vs. Hedonism

Another example of a trend is the focus on biohacking and longevity, epitomized by figures like Brian Johnson, who promotes optimizing health to live longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Johnson successfully built an audience for two years before launching a supplements and olive oil company, generating $1.5 million in product sales on its first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, demonstrating a powerful [[business_models_for_content_creators | Business Models for Content Creators]] approach.

The anti-trend, in contrast, would embrace a more hedonistic, "live for today" approach, focusing on enjoying life without extreme health optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. While not explicitly a business model in the transcript, it illustrates the concept of diametrically opposed consumer desires.

### Sleep Optimization vs. Sleep Deprivation

The trend of sleep optimization, as seen with products like the Eight Sleep mattress that tracks and improves sleep fitness, could inspire a paid membership around sleep called "The 100 Club," focusing on achieving perfect sleep scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

The anti-trend would be "The Zero Club," catering to individuals who prioritize activities over sleep or embrace sleep deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

## Advantages of Antitrend Positioning

The [[importance_of_antitrend_positioning | importance of antitrend positioning]] lies in several key advantages:
*   **Reduced Competition**: Anti-trends typically face significantly less competition compared to mainstream trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This can make market entry and growth easier.
*   **Premium Pricing**: Services or products aligned with anti-trends may command a premium price due to their unique or specialized nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   **Sustainable Growth**: While "hypey" AI-powered apps may seem like flash-in-the-pan opportunities, the skills learned in scaling such businesses are transferable to future ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. Furthermore, even if a business model is short-lived, the financial gains can provide "first nut" capital for future, more stable endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. Some investors might even consider a [[pay_for_performance_business_models | profit-sharing model]] for such ventures rather than seeking equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

Focusing on non-obvious use cases for new technologies, and then considering their anti-trends, can reveal untapped market potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. This approach encourages entrepreneurs to consider practical financial gains and stability over solely focusing on "changing the world" from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

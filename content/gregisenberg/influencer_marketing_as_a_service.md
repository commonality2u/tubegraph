## What is Influencer Marketing as a Service?
[[influencer_marketing_strategies | Influencer marketing as a service]] is a "done for you" offering that focuses on outreach to influencers for product promotion, particularly within the software and B2B Small and Medium Business (SMB) sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. This approach aims to build trust and educate potential users about a software product at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

### How it Works
The core strategy involves:
1.  **Finding Software Companies** Look for software companies that are building in public or those actively seeking growth, such as those mentioned on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.
2.  **Influencer Outreach** Offer unlimited [[influencer_marketing_and_outreach_tactics | influencer outreach]] to YouTubers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.
3.  **Monetization for Influencers** Propose a payment structure for influencers that includes both an upfront fee (e.g., $500 per video) and [[affiliate_marketing_as_a_business_model | recurring affiliate commissions]] (e.g., 30% of sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. This makes the partnership lucrative for the influencer over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
4.  **Reporting and Optimization** Create a report showing the return on investment (ROI) by comparing influencer subscriber counts, view counts, costs, and generated [[affiliate_marketing_as_a_business_model | affiliate commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. This allows for strategic reinvestment in the most effective influencers and continuous optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.

### Client Acquisition and Pricing
This service can be offered at a monthly fee, for example, $2,000-$3,000 per month, plus a budget for influencer payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. The value proposition should be conversion-rate focused, emphasizing the revenue generated for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.

## Tactical Implementation for Influencer Outreach

### Finding Influencer Contact Information
*   **YouTube About Section** YouTube channels often display a public email address in their "About" section, though it may be behind a CAPTCHA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
*   **Scraping Services** Services on platforms like Fiverr can scrape YouTube channels for associated email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
*   **Email Validation** Use tools like Zero Bounce to validate collected email addresses before sending cold emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Cold Email Software** Utilize cold email software and strategies (e.g., 20 different domains, two inboxes per domain, Instantly, Microsoft 365) to send a large volume of personalized emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Optimizing Campaigns
*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis** Analyze the ratio of influencer subscribers/view counts to their cost to identify underpriced creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.
*   **Reinvesting Capital** Reinvest campaign capital into the influencers who generated the most impact and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
*   **Growth Flywheel** As more influencers discuss a product, newer or aspiring influencers in the same niche may review the product for free, seeking [[affiliate_marketing_as_a_business_model | affiliate commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. This creates a "digital gravity" effect, attracting more affiliates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

## Broader Business Implications

### YouTube as a Marketing Funnel
YouTube can serve as a top-of-funnel strategy for service businesses, attracting inbound leads by becoming an expert in a specific niche through daily or weekly content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This is seen in the success of channels like Julian Goldie and Jackie Chu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

### The Power of Long-Form Content
Long-form content is significantly more impactful for B2B and service businesses than short-form content, often leading to 10x more revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. It builds a deep level of trust with the audience, making them more receptive to high-ticket offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. Even non-professionally produced long-form videos (e.g., Loom recordings) can be effective if the content provides genuine value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

### Negative Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
By integrating [[affiliate_marketing_as_a_business_model | affiliate offers]] into content, businesses can subsidize their customer acquisition costs, potentially achieving a zero to negative CAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>. This means the revenue from affiliate sales can offset or even exceed the cost of acquiring new customers for the primary service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.

### Comparison to Traditional Agencies
Many traditional [[influencer_marketing_strategies | influencer marketing agencies]] are not focused on conversion rates or Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. Positioning an influencer marketing service as revenue-focused and transparent, perhaps with a founder letter detailing past experiences, can differentiate it in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

## Other Business Models Leveraging Influencers and Content

### Local Marketing Agencies
A successful model involves creating a local-only marketing agency for specific high-value service categories, like CrossFit gyms, estheticians, or pool cleaning services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The strategy involves:
*   **Targeting** Using platforms like Facebook to target high-income individuals with specific interests in a geographical area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Lead Generation** Scraping Google Maps for businesses' email addresses (using services like Fiverr for bulk scraping and Hunter.io or Phantom Buster for individual emails), validating them with tools like Zero Bounce, and then sending cold emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Standardized Marketing Stack** Once a marketing strategy is proven for one business in a niche (e.g., Instagram ads for an e-book download, email nurture campaigns, account growth), it can be replicated for others in the same category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Industry Expertise** Specializing in a specific vertical allows for deeper expertise and creates a competitive moat due to learning effects and less sophisticated local competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Referral Network** Businesses within the same industry often know each other, leading to strong referral potential once initial clients are successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Scaling with AI** AI tools can automate significant portions of the process, from generating ad copy to creating eBooks, allowing for scaling with fewer personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

### TikTok SEO for Local Businesses
With Gen Z increasingly using social media (Instagram, TikTok) for local searches instead of Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>, there's an opportunity for "TikTok SEO as a service" for fine dining, cocktail bars, and other experiential businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.
*   **Content Creation** Create user-generated content (UGC) videos like "Five best pizzerias in X neighborhood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.
*   **Rapid Ranking** Unlike traditional SEO, social media SEO can yield impact within 30 days and can be refreshed monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.
*   **Monetization** Charge clients (e.g., $1,000-$2,000 per month) for generating inbound traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Viral Moments** A viral video can lead to other creators organically including the client's business, creating a flywheel effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.
*   **Building City-Specific Accounts** Create accounts like "Cool Spots Denver" to serve as local "Yelp" alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.
*   **Paid Ads** Use Instagram-only ads with a call to action to follow the account, building a "follow funnel" and remarketing audience for sustained brand building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.
*   **SMS/DM Automation** Use tools like Lelo (a "drop CRM" for email, SMS, Instagram) to automate responses to DMs and promote content at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

### Music Artist Development
This business model treats music artists like digital products, using digital marketing tactics to grow their listenership and social media presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.
*   **Content Strategy** Record live studio sessions, chop them into short social media clips, and schedule daily posts across all channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.
*   **Paid Social Media Ads** Run Instagram ads to grow artist profiles, influencing stream counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.
*   **Fan Lifetime Value** Music fans have a high customer lifetime value, as they tend to return to an artist's back catalog indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>.
*   **Monetization & Exit Strategy** Acquire a percentage of an artist's back catalog (e.g., 20%), invest capital (e.g., $1,000/month in ads) to grow their monthly listeners (e.g., to 300,000 on Spotify) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. Labels will then approach the artist, and the service can sell its percentage of the back catalog to the label for a profit, creating "mini-exits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. This functions like a venture portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>.

## Overarching Themes

### Every Company is a Media Company
The increasing economic viability of owned media over traditional advertising channels means that every company is essentially becoming a media company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. Owned media represents a long-term investment that cannot be taken away, with its upfront cost amortizing to near zero over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.

### Marketing Leverage
Building owned media, such as a podcast or a newsletter focused on a specific target audience, creates significant marketing leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>. It can lead to larger companies in the space proactively seeking partnerships or sponsorships, opening doors to deeper business relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

A comprehensive marketing strategy for a startup could involve:
*   Scraping and cold emailing/DMing the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>.
*   Importing contacts into Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn for display ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:43">[01:12:43]</a>.
*   Building an email nurture sequence for sign-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a>.
*   Creating a podcast specifically for the target ICP and a newsletter to promote it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>.

This approach can rapidly elevate a company's profile within its industry and provide a competitive advantage by leveraging digital media expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.

Implementing payments within vertical SaaS solutions is considered a crucial strategy for building substantial businesses in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. This approach is highlighted as a significant "fintech opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.

## The Power of Owning the Transaction

A key characteristic of every large industry-specific software company is that they "own the transaction" within their niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>. By integrating payment processing directly into the software, vertical SaaS companies can achieve rapid scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>.

### Expanding Market Opportunity

Integrating payments fundamentally changes the addressable market size for a vertical SaaS business:
*   **Software Revenue vs. Transaction Revenue** Traditional software revenue, based on monthly fees, can limit perceived market size. For instance, if there are one million restaurants in the US and a software charges $10/month, the total software market is $120 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Industry Transactions** By contrast, the restaurant industry processes an estimated $1 trillion in revenue annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.# Implementing Payments in Vertical SaaS Solutions

If a vertical SaaS company like Toast takes even a small percentage of each transaction, its market size dramatically increases from $120 million to a share of that trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

### Strategic Implementation

If a company can build a [[developing_a_wedge_product_in_vertical_saas | wedge product]] that engages customers *before* or *after* the transaction, it positions itself to eventually "capture the transaction" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>.

For example, in the trade school industry, payments were often processed through external platforms like PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. By integrating payments directly into the trade school's existing student management application, which already handled student data, schedules, and attendance, the process became much more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>. This eliminated manual export of transaction records and simplified financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.

Vertical-specific payments, while not always a [[developing_a_wedge_product_in_vertical_saas | wedge product]] itself, presents a significant opportunity to build a very large business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>.

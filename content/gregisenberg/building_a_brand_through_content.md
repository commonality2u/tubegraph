The traditional marketing funnel is an "entirely wrong way to think about modern marketing" and can be "deceptive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Instead, a new approach called "digital gravity" offers a more accurate visualization of how to build brands and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Digital Gravity Concept

The marketing funnel, where people enter and then buy a product at the bottom, doesn't reflect how consumers actually make purchasing decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. In reality, people interact with a brand, move away, get "sucked back in," rotate around it multiple times, and then "finally touch down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This process can take years, especially for significant purchases like manufacturing industry products, where a decision cycle could be five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Digital gravity proposes that [[Branding and marketing strategies for products | building a brand]] or company involves creating "digital mass on the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The more mass a brand accumulates, the more influence it gains within its niche or sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This mass is primarily built through content and by marketing everywhere the customer is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### From Small Spec to Influential Planet
Initially, a company is like a "small spec" with no influence on potential customers (comets) flying by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. As more mass is built, more people are "sucked into that orbit," leading to increased "touchdowns" that convert into revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This generates a growth flywheel, where revenue is reinvested to build even more mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Marketing as a Continuous Process
The concept of a "marketing campaign," a holdover from military terminology, implies a start and a stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. However, modern marketing is continuous; companies are "constantly doing marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This shifts the mindset to continuously creating content that adds mass to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Tactical Playbooks for Digital Gravity

### B2B Playbook: Making a Company Famous in 12 Months
This framework focuses on making a brand famous to its target audience within 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

#### 1. Target Audience Identification & Email Scraping
*   Identify a smaller target audience, often around 50,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   Scrape their emails using tools like Apollo.io or even LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

#### 2. Paid Advertising
*   Import scraped emails into Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads to create custom match lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Facebook Ads typically match 30-40% of the emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   Run ads indefinitely in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   Utilize UGC [[AI in Content Creation and Marketing | AI Avatar ads]] (e.g., HeyGen for avatars, Eleven Labs for voice) addressing pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   Create 100 variations of ads with different hooks, settings, and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Allocate 80% of the budget to the best-performing ads (lowest CPC) and 20% for continuous testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   Founders should consider making themselves famous through these ads, as "people buy from people not Brands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

#### 3. Cold Email Outreach
*   Cold email the entire scraped list using tools like Mail Reef (for specialized AWS servers) and Smart Lead (for managing multiple email accounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   Differentiate between transactional, newsletter, and cold email domains to prevent main domain compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   Cold emails should mirror the ad strategy, focusing on problem-solution orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
*   The goal is to land as much email as possible in an inbox to increase surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   Cold email "100% works" when messages are specific and provide value, addressing a direct problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

#### 4. [[Creator business model involving short form and long form content | Building a Media Business]] (Podcast and Newsletter)
*   Turn customer conversations into a podcast by recording their pain points and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.
*   Send weekly podcast updates via a newsletter to the entire email list (e.g., using MailerLite or Beehiiv) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. The content should be industry-specific and educational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   A strong podcast can create a leverage point, turning the company into a media company and a "profit center" instead of a cost center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. For example, a podcast can generate enough ad revenue to subsidize the entire growth team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
*   Many large companies, like Arrow Electronics and Red Bull, function as media companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. Y Combinator is also a media company that sells venture capital, doubling down on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

#### 5. Content Repurposing and Social Channels
*   Use tools like Swell AI to transcribe video podcasts, extract pain points, create show notes, and generate media assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   Turn long-form content into blog posts, white papers, and short-form videos for platforms like LinkedIn and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.
*   Run Instagram-only ads with a call to action to "follow this account for more content like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. This can grow followers cheaply (e.g., 30 cents per follower) and provide free impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
*   The goal is to make ads feel like organic content to reduce costs and increase impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.

### B2C Playbook: Winning in the Consumer Space
Consumer marketing is highly competitive and requires exceptional marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

#### 1. Product & Market
*   Ensure a huge Total Addressable Market (TAM) is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.
*   Content must be broad enough to target a large subset of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.
*   [[building_apps_with_a_strong_consumer_brand | Build an application]] that performs a single function exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
*   Consider charging $7.99 a week, which translates to about $29 a month, as an impulse purchase that can yield three months of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

#### 2. Paid Ads & Influencer Marketing
*   Focus on Facebook Ads and TikTok Ads for conversion events like app signups or paid actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   Create numerous ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
*   Hire 5-10 UGC creators (e.g., for ~$1,000/month for a video a day) to test content and identify what goes viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.
*   Content should often feature a hook, a pain point, and the product as the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. The goal is for ads to feel like content and be entertaining/educational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.
*   Spin up multiple TikTok accounts (e.g., 10) and remix the best-performing UGC content using AI tools (ChatGPT for scripts, HeyGen for videos, Eleven Labs for audio, CapCut for editing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
*   Choose a unique product name to avoid competition on Google search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
*   Pixel visitors to the website (using Facebook, TikTok, Google pixels) to enable indefinite remarketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.
*   Implement an email nurture sequence on the website to upsell the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.
*   [[Creating engaging content for different platforms | Influencer outreach]] at scale: Scrape emails of YouTube creators in your niche, cold email them to inquire about pricing, and identify arbitrage opportunities by comparing views to costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>.
*   Offer a three-video package deal with an affiliate commission (e.g., 30% recurring) to ensure creator loyalty and create a moat against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.
*   Replicate this process for Instagram (e.g., using IG Leads) and TikTok by scraping emails from relevant hashtags or profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. This strategy can lead to significantly lower CPMs than direct ad purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.

#### 3. Programmatic SEO
*   Utilize programmatic SEO for the product once the app gains domain authority (e.g., 40+ DA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
*   Target low-competition, long-tail [[Keyword research for content marketing | keywords]] related to the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.
*   [[Developing compelling writing content using frameworks | Create blog posts]] by scraping top-ranking content for target keywords, generating an outline, and writing section-by-section with AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.
*   Publish a high volume of articles (e.g., 10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.
*   Once a page receives human traffic, an SEO/content specialist should refine it to ensure it resonates with both Google's ranking factors and human readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.
*   Place calls to action (CTAs) for app sign-ups strategically on the page (e.g., after the first paragraph, visible in every scroll frame, and as a pop-up at 25-50% scroll rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>. This also helps in pixeling visitors for remarketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

This guide explores the process of creating viral, AI-driven content for ads and commercials, focusing on practical steps and monetization strategies. It draws insights from the success of AI filmmaker PJ, who uses Google V3 (also known as VO3) to produce highly engaging content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Opportunity in AI-driven Content

The current landscape is experiencing a deluge of content, and with generative AI, this is expected to increase "10x, 100x more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Therefore, the ability to make content that people want to watch and share is paramount, even more so than technical production skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This presents significant opportunities for building businesses around [[AIdriven business ideas and growth strategies | generative AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

Creating effective AI-driven content for ads and commercials doesn't require high technical expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The focus should be on creating entertaining content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Case Study: The "Peppermint" Commercial

PJ's viral "Peppermint" commercial, an AI-generated pharmaceutical ad, demonstrates the potential of this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

The ad's concept involved a satirical take on pharmaceutical commercials, where a pill (Peppermint) designed to combat depression secretly causes puppies to appear at one's doorstep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Why it Went Viral

The commercial's success stemmed from several factors:
*   **Unexpected Twist**: It starts like a typical pharmaceutical ad but takes a sharp, humorous turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Emotional Rollercoaster**: Viewers experience confusion, humor, and surprise, leading to engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Satirical Style**: It mimics the format of common commercials while injecting an absurd, SNL-like humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## The Content Creation Process

The process involves several key steps, leveraging different AI tools.

### Step 1: Ideation and Scripting with LLMs

Start with a "kernel of an idea hook" that is unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Initial Prompting**: Begin by giving the LLM (Large Language Model) generalized instructions and letting it generate cliché content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
    *   For the "Peppermint" ad, the prompt asked for "four scripts for a standard pharmaceutical commercial for a fake medication that solves depression by taking a pill that's a play on words that includes pup in the name and it sounds like a real medication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. It also specified the format (20-second prescription commercial, starting with people battling depression, then introducing the "pup" pill, and a puppy delivery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously re-feed favorite lines and direct the LLM towards desired styles (e.g., "give me more in that line," "make it unhinged," "make it like non sequiturs") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
    *   Roughly 70% of the lines in the "Peppermint" commercial originated from ChatGPT through this iterative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Outsourcing Taste**: If struggling with ideas, ask the LLM for specific comedic styles (e.g., "create jokes that Seth Rogen would like" or "imagine your Bill Burr doing a standup comedy routine") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   **Multiple LLMs**: Experiment with different models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok (especially its unhinged mode) for varied outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### Step 2: Generating Prompts for V3

Once the script is finalized, break it down into individual dialogue lines and generate prompts for each shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   **LLM Assistance**: Use an LLM to extrapolate detailed prompts based on a general prompt structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:17:04]</a>.
    *   The LLM can create character descriptions (e.g., "Sarah, a middle-aged woman in her 50s") and maintain consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   **Prompt Detail**: V3 doesn't require overly complex prompts. Simple descriptions of what's happening, including pose, shot type, camera type, background, and character emotion, are often sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:18:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:02]</a>.

### Step 3: Generating Video with V3 (Google VO3)

*   **Settings**: Use the VO3 model for the highest quality output and generally opt for one output per prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:29]</a>.
*   **Cost**: V3 can be expensive, costing around $2-3 per shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:33]</a>. The "Peppermint" commercial, with about 30 clips (resulting in 10 good ones), cost approximately $500 in credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:44]</a>.
*   **Audio Generation**: V3 generates audio along with the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:24]</a>.
    *   **Caveats**: Audio generation can be inconsistent (sometimes no audio, sometimes gibberish subtitles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:19:03]</a>. Avoid including quotes in prompts to reduce weird subtitles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **Character Consistency**: Currently, V3 does not maintain character consistency well between shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. To achieve a similar look, describe characters in extreme detail for every prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:59]</a>. This limitation means prioritizing shots where the same character doesn't appear twice, or focusing on single-character shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:47]</a>.
*   **Iteration and Refinement**: Review generated shots and refine prompts if needed. For example, if a UPS guy isn't entering through the door as intended, adjust the prompt with the LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:20:05]</a>.

### Step 4: Editing and Post-Production

*   **Software**: While Final Cut Pro was used for the "Peppermint" ad, CapCut is a viable free option, as is DaVinci Resolve (a professional-tier free editor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:35]</a>.
*   **Enhancements**:
    *   **Camera Movements**: Prompting for camera movements like "push in" or "dolly in" can make AI shots feel more cinematic and less "AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:23]</a>.
    *   **Emotion**: Explicitly describing character emotions in prompts (e.g., "she coyly quips her response aware that she's making a joke about her husband's infidelity") helps V3 capture nuanced performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:47]</a>.

## Going Viral: The Power of the Hook

Creating the content is only half the battle; getting it seen is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:47]</a>. The "hook" or headline for your post is as important as the video itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:39]</a>.

### Crafting an Effective Hook (especially for X/Twitter)

*   **Mr. Beast Analogy**: The title/hook is more important than the thumbnail, and the thumbnail is more important than the actual video content, as it drives initial engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:35]</a>.
*   **The "Peppermint" Hook Example**: "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials. I made this for $500 in V3 credits in less than a day. What's the argument for spending 500K now? Steal my prompt below." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:27:00]</a>
*   **Anatomy of a Viral Hook**:
    *   **Low-key Flex**: Establishes credibility (e.g., "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:18]</a>.
    *   **Cost/Time Comparison**: Highlights the efficiency of AI (e.g., "$500 in V3 credits in less than a day" vs. "$500K") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:33]</a>.
    *   **Trendjacking**: Mentions trending AI tools (e.g., "V3" or "Cling 2.0") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:30]</a>.
    *   **Symmetry/Numbers**: Visually appealing number comparisons (e.g., 500k to 500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:38]</a>.
    *   **Questions**: Drives replies and boosts algorithm engagement (e.g., "What's the argument for spending 500K now?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:46]</a>.
    *   **Value Proposition**: Encourages clicks and engagement (e.g., "Steal my prompt below," "Here's how I made this video step by step") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:28:32]</a>.
*   **Avoid Clichés**: Steer clear of overused phrases like "Hollywood is cooked" or "Oh my god, what the [heck]" in your hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:16]</a>. Instead, find your own unique provocative statements (e.g., "What the [heck] did I just make" or "This is my most unhinged video I've made") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:36]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies for AI-driven Content

There are numerous ways to monetize [[AIdriven content creation for brand growth | AI-driven content creation]] for ads and commercials:

1.  **Build a Personal Brand**: Use V3 to create content that showcases your skills and build a brand for yourself. This can lead to downstream work and attract clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:45:06]</a>. An audience is a valuable asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:57]</a>.

2.  **Attract Direct Clients for Commercials**: Create samples (like the "Peppermint" ad) to pitch to agencies, media buyers, or companies directly.
    *   **Niche Focus**: Target specific industries like food products (e.g., beer companies, CPG brands like Feastables), underwear brands, or other consumer goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:33:17]</a>.
    *   **Value Proposition**: Offer "unhinged special effects shots" that agencies couldn't achieve with traditional budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:27]</a>.
    *   **Pricing**: Charge anywhere from $5,000 on the low end, asserting the value of your skill and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:40]</a>. This is analogous to Picasso charging for 30 years of experience, not 30 seconds of drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:59]</a>.

3.  **Build a Portfolio to Work with Agencies**: Create a portfolio of diverse or niche-specific commercials.
    *   **Niche Down**: If starting out, focus on a specific niche that genuinely interests you (e.g., knife commercials, boot commercials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:35:05]</a>.
    *   **"Good Artists Copy, Great Artists Steal"**: Recreate award-winning commercials shot for shot using AI tools to learn pacing and flow. Then, apply these learned frameworks to new, adjacent products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:36:04]</a>. This helps level up your skills as a filmmaker/editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:59]</a>.

4.  **Create a Narrative Series with Brand Integrations**: Develop an episodic narrative series (e.g., Neural Viz's "moniverse" alien series on YouTube) and integrate products naturally within the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:38:34]</a>.
    *   **Strategy**: Take popular social formats (e.g., "Man on the Street," "Zillow videos," "Joe Rogan set") and add an unexpected AI twist (e.g., aliens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:39:13]</a>.
    *   **Monetization**: Beyond merch and Patreon, offer product integrations (e.g., aliens finding Tabasco sauce as an artifact) to brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:34]</a>.

5.  **Sell Courses/Digital Products**: Bundle up your knowledge into courses, PDFs, or other digital products to teach others how to create [[AIdriven content marketing strategies | AI-driven content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:40:03]</a>.

6.  **Consulting with Larger Companies**: Offer consulting services to Fortune 500 companies on integrating generative AI into their content strategies, ensuring legal compliance and security procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:41:00]</a>. Charge based on the company's scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:09]</a>.

7.  **Build a Sketch Comedy Channel**: Create a Key & Peele-style sketch comedy show using AI. Monetize through audience growth and potential brand integrations (similar to Bang energy drinks on TikTok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:46]</a>.

8.  **Narrative Films (Episodic Content Preferred)**: While long-form narrative films (e.g., 90-minute features) are possible, the rapid iteration of AI tools makes them less ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:42:15]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Episodic Content**: Prioritize weekly or short-form episodic content (e.g., 2-minute episodes) for the "new creator economy." This competes in a larger market with lower budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:40]</a>.

9.  **Pitch Brands on Narrative Content**: Propose creating bespoke narrative series for brands, where their products are integrated as central elements (e.g., a whole series where "all the relics and artifacts are just in your brand") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:17]</a>.

10. **Target Underserved Niches**: Identify small sub-niches with high demand and low supply of content.
    *   **Example**: Bible content (open-sourced IP, 2 billion daily active users, high demand, low supply of AI films) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:57]</a>.
    *   **Another Example**: "BookTok" or "Romantasy" (romantic fantasy) communities. Create book promos or scenes from books for authors, who would pay for such marketing materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:46:02]</a>.
    *   This allows for targeting verticals that traditionally couldn't afford high-level cinematography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:32]</a>.

Ultimately, the best advice is to **"do what fascinates you"**, copy successful frameworks, and apply them to unique niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:28]</a>.

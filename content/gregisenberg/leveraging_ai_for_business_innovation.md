Leveraging AI for business innovation is a significant opportunity, particularly through tools like Google's AI Studio and the Gemini models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. Logan Kilpatrick, Lead PM for Google's AI Studio, highlights how these technologies can be used to [[building_businesses_with_ai_tools | build businesses]] and [[leveraging_ai_for_business_efficiency | leverage multi-trillion dollar technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. The aim is to demonstrate the unique capabilities of Gemini and AI Studio that are not possible with other AI models or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:04">[01:30:04]</a>.

## Google AI Studio and Gemini Models

AI Studio is designed to showcase the full capabilities of Google's AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:04">[02:39:04]</a>. It is free to use, offering various Gemini models and even open-source Gemma models for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:04">[02:45:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:04">[07:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:04">[07:21:04]</a>. This removes the economic burden for developers and startups wanting to [[ai_driven_business_ideas_and_startups | build cool AI products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:04">[29:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:04">[29:12:04]</a>.

Key features and models include:
*   **Basic Prompting Experience:** Users can interact directly with models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:04">[02:57:04]</a>.
*   **Prompt Gallery:** Offers a wide range of examples, from silly ideas to code optimization, showcasing the models' full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:04">[03:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:04">[03:16:04]</a>.
*   **Long Context Processing:** One of the most impressive features, allowing models to process extremely long inputs, such as a 30-minute video (531,000 tokens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:04">[02:52:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:04">[03:42:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:04">[04:48:04]</a>. This enables extraction of specific information from extensive media, like generating a list of museum exhibits from a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:04">[04:00:04]</a>. This capability is difficult or impossible to achieve with traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:04">[04:32:04]</a>. This opens opportunities for creating online directories from data trapped in media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:04">[05:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:04">[05:30:04]</a>.
*   **Gemini Models:**
    *   **2.0 Flash Model:** More powerful and slightly more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:04">[07:34:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:04">[07:39:04]</a>.
    *   **Flashlight Model:** Higher rate limits, less intelligent but can perform many core functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:04">[07:39:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:04">[07:43:04]</a>.
    *   **Pro Model:** Experimental variant, the most intelligent model available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:04">[07:49:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:04">[07:54:04]</a>.
    *   **Reasoning Model:** A new frontier capability that allows the model to "think" about different things before generating an output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:04">[07:54:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:04">[08:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:04">[08:32:04]</a>. This is analogous to writing an outline before an essay or code structure before programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:04">[11:30:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:04">[11:35:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:04">[11:39:04]</a>. For example, it can take a code snippet and generate a full website, landing page, and SaaS app, outlining the desired outcomes, technology stack, and MVP features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:04">[09:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:04">[10:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:04">[10:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:04">[10:37:04]</a>. This capability is creating significant value today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:04">[12:29:04]</a>.

*   **Native Function Calling:** AI can connect existing products, such as Google Maps API, to create new experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:04">[18:18:04]</a>. This leads to a "combinatorial explosion" of business possibilities by integrating multiple products with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:04">[19:15:04]</a>. The amount of work required for such integrations is surprisingly small compared to historical SaaS product solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:04">[19:25:04]</a>.

### Real-Time Streaming and AI Co-presence
The multimodal live API enables real-time streaming, allowing AI to see and hear what the user does, providing context and assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:04">[20:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:04">[20:22:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:04">[20:29:04]</a>. This capability hints at a future of "AI co-presence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:04">[01:52:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:04">[20:22:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:04">[23:20:04]</a>.

This technology can revolutionize various aspects:
*   **Future of Work:** AI partners can observe what users see and provide intelligence, potentially increasing work speed by 1.5x, 2x, or 3x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:04">[24:52:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:04">[25:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:04">[25:17:04]</a>.
*   **Coding Assistance:** Instead of just autocomplete, AI can act as a senior developer pair programming, understanding the entire screen, including code editors and browsers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:04">[23:29:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:04">[23:35:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:04">[23:40:04]</a>. It can run code, browse the internet for solutions, and provide real-time feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:04">[25:46:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:04">[25:51:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:04">[25:55:04]</a>.
*   **Democratizing Access to Expertise:** Helps individuals with varying technology skills learn new skills, like coding or video editing, by providing a virtual tutor or expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:04">[24:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:04">[24:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:04">[24:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:04">[24:25:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:33:04">[27:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:04">[27:39:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:04">[27:56:04]</a>.

Even if current AI interactions seem imperfect (e.g., voice intonations), the core capabilities are powerful enough to ignite new ideas and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:04">[26:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:04">[26:45:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:04">[26:52:04]</a>. The "research" of new business models now means playing with AI models to discover their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:04">[17:54:04]</a>. This has a massive [[impact_of_ai_on_business_and_entrepreneurship | impact on business and entrepreneurship]] by enabling the [[automating_business_processes_with_AI | automation of painful service-based tasks]] that previously required human agencies or consulting firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:04">[16:52:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:04">[17:00:04]</a>. These "boring" businesses can scale to millions of dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:04">[17:14:04]</a>.

Building an audience through owned media, such as a YouTube channel or podcast, is highlighted as a powerful way to attract interested individuals and create products and services without geographical constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This approach allows creators to "print money" and subsidize other ventures, representing a new [[blog_and_newsletter_business_models | business model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Newsletter Service for Founders

A significant opportunity exists in offering a "done for you" newsletter service for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Many founders want a newsletter but lack the time or desire to write it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

The service model involves:
*   **Interviewing Founders**: Conducting weekly hour-long interviews with founders to gather ideas and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.
*   **Content Creation**: Turning interview transcripts into newsletter content. This can be significantly aided by [[utilizing_technology_and_ai_in_newsletter_businesses | AI tools]] like ChatGPT to translate raw data into a specific tone, style, and voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.
*   **Automation**: Setting up automations (e.g., using Phantom Buster) to send newsletter subscription links via automated DMs to new followers on platforms like Twitter or new connections on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

This service allows founders to build a personal brand and generate inbound leads for their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. It's a "done for you solution" that requires minimal time commitment from the founder (e.g., 2-3 hours per week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## [[building_audience_and_subscribers_for_newsletters | Building Audience and Subscribers for Newsletters]]

Key [[building_audience_and_subscribers_for_newsletters | strategies for audience growth]] include:
*   **Leveraging Existing Audiences**: Approaching individuals who already have a significant following on platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn and migrating that audience to a newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
*   **Email Scraping**:
    *   From Twitter followers, scraping email addresses has shown a 40-50% validity rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.
    *   From LinkedIn connections using tools like SalesQL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.
    *   Emails should be validated using appropriate tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
    *   Sequencing new emails into the newsletter gradually (e.g., 200 per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
*   **Community Building**: Create a free online community (e.g., "Founders Going Viral on LinkedIn.com") where weekly tips are shared on how to grow on the platform. This serves as a lead magnet, with a monthly call and an eventual upsell to the full service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Referral and Organic Growth**: Encourage subscribers to forward newsletters to friends, leading to organic list growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

### Monetization and Value Proposition
*   **Return on Audience Spend (ROAS)**: Founders view newsletter services as a direct return on investment, as the lifetime value of a customer can justify significant monthly fees (e.g., paying $100,000/year for a service that brings in customers worth $25,000 each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>.
*   **Platform Independence**: Newsletters offer "schmuck insurance" by moving audiences off social media platforms (like Twitter) and onto owned email lists, reducing dependence on external platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.
*   **Tiered Pricing**: Services can range from basic content creation (e.g., $2500/month) to advanced offerings like lead magnet creation as a service (e.g., $5000-8000/month) and design help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Niche Newsletter Ideas

### Cheap Flights Newsletter
This idea resurrects the "Scott's Cheap Flights" model by creating a newsletter that aggregates cheap flight deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>.

Key aspects:
*   **Data Aggregation**: Utilize Google Flights alerts, which notify users when flight prices drop dramatically between selected cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>. This can be automated with low-code tools like Zapier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.
*   **Targeting**: Run Facebook ads targeting people interested in "frequent traveler" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Charge a subscription fee, and potentially earn kickbacks or affiliate commissions from travel partners like Kiwi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>.
*   **Scalability**: Replicate the model for all major metropolitan areas in the US and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>, creating distinct newsletters for each location (e.g., "YYZ Deals.com" for Toronto) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.
*   **Content Expansion**: Once a foundational list is built, expand into related content such as local news or events (e.g., "come for the deals and stay for like local news") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.

This business benefits from the high CPM (cost per mille) in the travel and tourism sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_creating_and_monetizing_newsletters | General Newsletter Business Models]]

*   **Content Consistency**: The challenge of content creation is consistency, not necessarily the hours involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
*   **Role of the Creator**: A creator should view themselves as an editor or curator, rather than solely a writer, bringing in a pipeline of ideas and using a system to create content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Founder Energy**: In the early days, "founder energy" is crucial to break barriers and gain momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Trends**: The most effective way to build a business is to attach to a larger trend rather than educating the market on a new need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

> "Look for things that are bigger than you that are happening and then how do you attach yourself to them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

*   **"Un-gatekeeping" Information**: Sharing specialized knowledge openly, which used to be restricted, naturally attracts an audience and builds reputation, knowledge, and leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.
*   **Niche Focus**: Even a highly [[newsletter_specialization_by_industry_or_niche | niche podcast]] (e.g., digital out-of-home advertising) can attract a small but high-value audience with significant buying power, leading to a good living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>.
*   **Personal Branding**: Being authentic and focusing on topics of genuine interest helps attract the right followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>.

Newsletters are highlighted as a means to build "digital gravity" by increasing digital mass on the internet, which in turn creates greater serendipity and inbound opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

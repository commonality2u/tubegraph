The traditional marketing funnel, often described as a linear process where customers enter at the top and exit as buyers at the bottom, is an "entirely wrong way to think about modern marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This model is deceptive, hiding what actually happens in customer journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. People don't buy things linearly; they interact with a brand, disengage, get "sucked back in," rotate multiple times, and then finally convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Marketing is not a series of start-and-stop campaigns, a concept derived from World War II military operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Instead, marketing must be continuous, a constantly running process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Digital Gravity: A New Model

A proposed alternative framework is "digital gravity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This concept describes how a brand or company builds "mass" on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The more digital mass a brand accumulates, the more influence it exerts within its niche or sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This mass is primarily built through content and by [[growth_marketing_strategies_for_startups | marketing]] everywhere the target customer is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

In this model, customers are like "comets" flying by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. A small, new company has no influence on them, but as it gains mass, more people get "sucked into that orbit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. As they remain in orbit, more "touchdowns" (conversions or revenue) occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This creates a growth flywheel where generated revenue is reinvested back into the company's growth, further increasing its digital mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

A key principle is that it's a "surface area game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. More content and more continuous effort lead to more success, similar to increasing batting swings to get on base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## B2B Playbook: Building Digital Gravity

For B2B companies, the strategy involves a multi-layered approach to build significant digital mass and influence.

### 1. Audience Identification and Engagement
*   **Targeting**: Start by identifying a smaller target audience, often around 50,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Email Scraping**: Scrape their emails using tools like Apollo.io, which can extract 10,000 emails for approximately $99 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. LinkedIn can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### 2. Paid Advertising
*   **Custom Audience Matching**: Import scraped emails into platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads to create custom match lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Facebook typically matches 30-40% of emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Continuous Ads**: Run these ads indefinitely in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   [[leveraging_ai_for_storytelling_and_marketing | AI Avatar Ads]]: Utilize User-Generated Content (UGC) AI Avatar ads that address target audience pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Tools like HeyGen (for avatar quality) and Eleven Labs (for voice) are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Testing Variations**: Create around 100 different ad variations with diverse hooks, settings, backgrounds, content, and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Allocate 80% of the budget to the best-performing ads (lowest CPC) and 20% for continuous testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **Founder's Role**: The founder can create a digital clone of themselves for these ads to build fame and ease future fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. People buy from people, not just brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

### 3. Cold Email Outreach
*   **Simultaneous Outreach**: Cold email the same scraped list simultaneously with paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   **Tools**: Use services like Mail Reef (AWS servers for cold email sending, e.g., 50,000 emails/month for $400) and SmartLead or Instantly.AI (email sending software for multiple accounts) <a class="yt=" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **Domain Isolation**: Maintain separate domains for transactional, newsletter, and cold emails to prevent a single domain from being compromised by aggressive sending practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **Messaging**: Focus on problem-solution orientation, similar to ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Cold email can be highly effective when tailored to specific pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

### 4. Building a Media Company
*   **Podcast Creation**: Turn customer conversations and feedback into a podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. Record formal settings to capture pain points and problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.
*   **Newsletter Distribution**: Send podcast episodes out via a newsletter to the scraped email list, often 200 emails per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Include a one-paragraph summary and five key takeaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. Tools like MailerLite and Beehiiv can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
*   **Leverage for Negotiations**: A successful podcast can become a leverage point. For instance, a healthtech startup grew its podcast to 180,000 downloads/month in 6 months, becoming a top 20 medical podcast, allowing them to negotiate better deals with large lab companies by offering media placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.
*   [[monetizing_leads_and_reinvesting_in_growth | Monetization]]: The media arm can become a profit center by selling ad placements on the podcast and in the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. This can subsidize the entire growth team's cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

### 5. Content Repurposing and Social Media Growth
*   [[strategies_for_media_and_content_creation | Content Repurposing]]: Transform video podcasts into various content formats using tools like Swell AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. This includes extracting pain points, creating transcripts, blog posts, white papers, clips, show notes, and other media assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.
*   **Multi-Platform Distribution**: Schedule content across all platforms where customers spend time (LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   **Social Media Growth Hacks**:
    *   **LinkedIn**: Short-form content from TikTok or Instagram Reels can go viral on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
    *   **Instagram**: Run "Instagram-only ads" with a call to action to "follow this account for more content like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. Targeting for impressions can yield followers at low costs (e.g., 30 cents per follower) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. This method helps gain free impressions from a larger follower base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.

### 6. The Long Game
This comprehensive strategy involves a continuous grind, with initial results taking around 90 days to appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. Over 18 months, consistent effort can lead to an email list of 130,000 subscribers driving 80,000 website clicks monthly from a newsletter that costs only $450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>. This contrasts sharply with paying $5 per click in life sciences, making owned media incredibly cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

Ultimately, a company's podcast can become its biggest driver of inbound leads due to the trust built from consistent asynchronous interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. Owning "mental real estate" in the customer's mind, such as being the go-to thought leader for a specific idea, is invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>. Creating new mental real estate is difficult and expensive; it's often easier to attach to an existing common idea and evolve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

## B2C Playbook: Navigating a Competitive Landscape

Winning in consumer markets is highly competitive, requiring exceptional marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

### 1. Market & Product Strategy
*   **Huge Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: Consumer success requires a massive addressable market to create broad enough content to target a large subset of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.
*   **App-Centric Approach**: Build an application that solves a single problem exceptionally well for a large audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
*   **Impulse Pricing**: Implement aggressive impulse-purchase pricing, such as $7.99/week (translates to $29/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>. This can generate three months of revenue from a single impulse buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.
*   **AI-Generated Content**: Use AI to create lead magnets like ebooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.

### 2. Paid Acquisition Channels
*   **Primary Channels**: Focus on Facebook Ads and TikTok Ads for conversion events like app sign-ups or paid actions within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   **Testing Variations**: Similar to B2B, run multiple ad variations to find the most effective ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
*   [[leveraging_creators_and_influencer_partnerships_for_business_growth | Influencer Partnerships]]:
    *   **UGC Creators**: Hire UGC creators (e.g., 5-10 for about $1,000/month for a video a day) to act as a test bed for viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>. Their content should feature a hook, pain point, and the product as the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.
    *   **TikTok Accounts**: Spin up 10 different TikTok accounts and create variations of the best-performing UGC content using AI tools like ChatGPT (for scripts), HeyGen (for videos), and Eleven Labs (for audio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
    *   **Strategic Naming**: Choose a unique product name that avoids competition on Google's first page when users search after seeing an ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
*   **Pixel Tracking & Remarketing**: Pixel website visitors (Facebook, TikTok, Google) to enable indefinite remarketing ads across platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. This expands the remarketing audience and creates a larger digital mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.
*   **Email Nurturing**: Capture emails on the website for an email nurture sequence that up-sells the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.

### 3. Scaling with Influencers and Affiliates
*   **Bulk Influencer Outreach**: For prosumer applications, scrape emails from YouTube channels and other platforms (e.g., IGleads.io for Instagram hashtags/keywords) related to the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>.
*   **Pricing Arbitrage**: Cold email influencers to inquire about their pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>. Build a table comparing average views to cost to find pricing discrepancies in the "imperfect market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Deals**: Structure deals with creators, typically buying a three-video package (e.g., $1,500) combined with a recurring affiliate commission (e.g., 30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. This creates stickiness and a moat, making it harder for competitors to poach creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
*   **CPM Advantage**: Creator-driven CPMs can be significantly lower (e.g., $5) compared to direct platform advertising (e.g., $10 on TikTok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.

### 4. [[the_role_of_seo_and_paid_ads_in_business_growth | Programmatic SEO]]
*   **Keyword Targeting**: As the app's website gains domain authority (trust measured by Google via backlinks), use programmatic SEO to rank for thousands of longtail, low-competition keywords related to the product category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
*   **Content Generation**: Scrape top-ranking content for target keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>. Use AI tools to generate blog post outlines and write content section by section for quality and readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
*   **Human Touch**: Aggressively publish thousands of articles (e.g., 10,000) with initial AI generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. Once a page gets traffic, a human SEO or content specialist edits it for optimal ranking and human consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.
*   **Call to Actions**: Include a call to action for the app after the first paragraph, ensure one callout is visible in every scroll frame (mobile/desktop), and implement a full-screen pop-up CTA at 25-50% scroll depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>. This also pixels visitors for remarketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

By layering these strategies, companies can build significant digital gravity, constantly showing up in customers' lives and driving exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

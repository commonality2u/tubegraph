This episode features Omar, who shares insights on [[building businesses with AI tools | building businesses with AI tools]] and generating revenue and cash flow, particularly through [[creating startup ideas using AI | startup ideas]] using AI avatars and full workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. The goal is to learn how to assemble an AI SaaS product that can generate cash with zero employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

Omar's personal journey into AI, particularly with AI avatars, began by playing with tools like Chat GPT with his children, which motivated him to "level up his game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. He realized the vast opportunity for [[building a successful AI startup | building a successful AI startup]] within this space, extending beyond children's content to many verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

## The Paradigm Shift in Business with AI

Omar highlights a significant transition in three key business areas: Product, Marketing, and Operations, driven by COVID-19 and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

*   **Product Development:**
    *   **Traditional:** Historically required raising VC capital, years to launch, and hiring expensive software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
    *   **AI Era:** Now, it's possible to [[building apps using AI tools | build products instantly]] at low cost with zero employees, eliminating the need for engineers in many cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

*   **Marketing Strategies:**
    *   **Traditional:** Relied on social media budgets, creative teams, professional advertising agencies, and seasonal "big campaigns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
    *   **AI Era:** Emphasizes solopreneurs and transparency, leading to "always-on" marketing where founders share their journey and earnings daily, engaging audiences continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

*   **Operational Models:**
    *   **Traditional:** Focused on hiring talent for productivity, requiring physical office spaces, and leading to lengthy product cycles with high overheads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
    *   **AI Era:** Shifted to remote working models, eliminating office costs, enabling global talent collaboration, and allowing businesses to be much leaner by [[building MVPs with AI tools | building faster with fewer people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

## Sequential Prompting: A Key AI Technique

Omar introduces "sequential prompting" as a powerful technique for leveraging AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. This method involves:
1.  Using Chat GPT to generate a specific prompt for another AI tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>.
2.  Taking that generated prompt and feeding it into a different AI tool (e.g., Leonardo AI for images, Cling AI for animation, Eleven Labs for voiceovers) to produce an output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.
3.  Connecting these outputs and tools in a sequence, potentially through a front-end user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

It's recommended to start this process manually to allow for rapid iteration and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>, then automate the workflow using tools like Zapier or by bringing in an engineer for more complex integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. This approach allows a single person to perform the work of five or six, using tools like Chat GPT and Leonardo AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

## Business Ideas and Applications

### 1. AI-First Personalized Greeting Cards (Moonpig 2.0)

Omar suggests [[building a 5 million startup using AI tools | building an AI-first version of Moonpig.com]], a company that specializes in personalized greeting cards and generates hundreds of millions in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:54:00">[28:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>.

*   **Concept:** Use AI to generate personalized, Disney/Pixar-style images and animated stories featuring users or their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:57:00">[26:57:00]</a>.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Image Upload:** Users upload a photo of a child or person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.
    2.  **Character Prompt Generation:** Chat GPT analyzes the image and generates a consistent character description (prompt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>.
    3.  **Image Generation:** This prompt is fed into Leonardo AI to create high-resolution, Disney/Pixar-style images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>.
    4.  **Story/Scene Creation:** Users can add additional characters and define scenarios (e.g., "waving goodbye to Mom on the first day of school") to generate new images depicting these moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:10:00">[44:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:58:00">[46:58:00]</a>.
    5.  **Text Overlay:** Text like "Good luck" can be added to the images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:11]</a>.
*   **Monetization:**
    *   **Premium Card Sales:** Offering personalized cards at a higher price point (e.g., $5-$10), justified by AI-driven personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:11:00">[33:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Monthly Memberships:** Unlimited card creation for a monthly fee ($10-$15) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:21:00">[33:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Upselling:** Matching items like flowers or chocolates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:00">[33:27:00]</a>.
*   **User Experience:** The platform should be designed to land users directly into a creation experience, assuming they want to figure things out by doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>.

### 2. Animated AI Avatars and GIFs

Using tools like Cling AI, static images generated by Leonardo AI can be turned into short, moving videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:03:00">[50:03:00]</a>.

*   **Features:** Cling AI also offers a "dub feature" for lip-syncing characters to spoken words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:30:00">[50:30:00]</a>.
*   **Application:** Create animated greeting cards, humorous GIFs for group chats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19:00">[25:19:00]</a>, or for marketing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:00:00">[28:00:00]</a>.
*   **Current Limitations:** Generating 5-second videos takes about 4 minutes, making it less scalable for a full product offering at present, but this is expected to accelerate significantly (e.g., with Sora API) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:06:00">[51:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>.
*   **Interim Solution:** A manual process with assistants could handle premium orders or video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:20:00">[51:20:00]</a>.

### 3. Personalized Stickers and Print-on-Demand Products

This idea leverages AI avatars to create physical products like stickers, with a focus on education or personalized gifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:53:00">[52:53:00]</a>.

*   **Concept:** Generate AI images of teachers or students for "well done" stickers or other classroom signage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:14:00">[53:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:50:00">[53:50:00]</a>.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **AI Character Generation:** Use Chat GPT and Leonardo AI to create images of people (e.g., teachers, students) in a desired style (e.g., "kiss cut sticker artwork") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:02:00">[54:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:14:00">[54:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:56:00">[54:56:00]</a>.
    2.  **Background Removal:** Use a tool like Remove.bg (or its API) to automatically remove the background, creating a clean PNG sticker image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:02:00">[59:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.
    3.  **Automated Fulfillment:** Integrate with a Print-on-Demand service like Printful (which has an API) to automatically fulfill orders and print physical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>. This allows for a fully [[building automated businesses with AI | automated business]] with zero manual input after setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.
*   **Marketing Strategy:** A "gorilla hacking" technique could involve finding staff photos on school websites, generating personalized stickers of them, and mailing these physical products to gain attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:19:00">[57:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

These ideas demonstrate how to build products and businesses by stitching together AI tools, often starting with manual processes to refine the workflow before automating them via APIs, showcasing the potential for [[building a sustainable AI startup | building a sustainable AI startup]] in the current AI landscape.

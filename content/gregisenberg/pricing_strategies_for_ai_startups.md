## Philosophy of Monetization
Before establishing a [[pricing_strategies_for_saas_products | pricing strategy]], it's crucial to define a company's philosophy on money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. A commonly held belief among highly successful companies is that money is a means to an end, not the end itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] "We don't make movies to make money, we make money to make more movies." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> - Walt Disney
> This philosophy was co-opted by Facebook: "We don't make services to make money, we make money to make better services." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

While it's possible to build a multi-million dollar company with a more "mercenary approach," the most successful companies often prioritize improving their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Core AI Pricing Framework
For an AI company, pricing can be approached by evaluating the value it provides in terms of human effort saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.

1.  **Calculate Human Input Saved:** Determine the amount of human effort and the associated cost that the AI solution replaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.
2.  **Account for Total Cost:** This includes not just salary, but also "emotional damage" or frustration saved by automating annoying tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Even tasks that only take 5-10 minutes can be worth more if they save significant emotional distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>.
3.  **Apply a Discount:** Price the AI service at a significant discount (e.g., 50-80%) compared to the human cost it saves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. This creates a "no-brainer" offer for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

## Adjusting Prices Over Time
Contrary to the common belief that prices can only go down, it is possible to increase prices thoughtfully if the product delivers significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.

*   **Monzo Example:** The Neo Bank Monzo, which initially offered many free services, started charging for things like additional ATM withdrawals and replacement cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>. Despite initial fears, customers largely found these changes fair because they valued the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.
*   **Uber Example:** Ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft initially offered very cheap rides to get users hooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. Once customers were integrated into the network, prices gradually increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.

Ultimately, customers tend to remember the value a product provides more than its initial price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. If a product creates great value, its optimal pricing can be determined over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. AI tools can even assist in figuring out this efficient pricing frontier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

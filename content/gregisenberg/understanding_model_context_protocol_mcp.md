Model Context Protocol (MCP) has gained significant attention and gone "completely viral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article, explained by Professor Ross Mike, aims to clarify what MCP is, its significance, and its [[potential_opportunities_with_mcp_in_startups | startup opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## The Problem: LLMs and Tools

### Limitations of Standalone LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) on their own are fundamentally incapable of performing meaningful actions beyond predicting the next word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. For example, an LLM cannot send an email or perform specific tasks on a user's behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Their primary function is predicting sequences, such as completing "My Big Fat Greek" with "wedding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Evolution: LLMs + Tools
Developers discovered how to enhance LLM capabilities by combining them with external tools, such as APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This allows LLMs to perform actions like searching the internet (e.g., Perplexity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, or integrating with automation services like Zapier or End8 to log emails in a spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

However, connecting multiple tools to an LLM for complex tasks (like searching, reading emails, and summarizing) becomes cumbersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. It feels like "gluing a bunch of different things together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The challenge lies in making these tools work cohesively with the LLM and stacking them effectively, which is why a "Jarvis level assistant" like Iron Man's does not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Each service provider's API may differ, requiring manual setup and presenting challenges with updates or changes, leading to a "nightmare" for engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## What is MCP?

MCP can be understood as a **standard** for LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Just as REST APIs provide a standard for companies to construct services for engineers to connect to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, MCP provides a unified way for LLMs to interact with external services and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Think of it as a **translation layer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>:
*   Before MCP, connecting tools was like trying to communicate with services speaking different languages (English, Spanish, Japanese) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   MCP translates these different "languages" into a single, unified language that the LLM can understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

This standard makes it simpler for LLMs to connect to and access outside resources like databases (e.g., Convex, Supabase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, enabling them to perform actions like creating new database entries seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## The MCP Ecosystem

The MCP ecosystem comprises four key components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>:

1.  **MCP Client**: The LLM-facing side, such as Tempo, Wind Surf, or Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
2.  **MCP Protocol**: The two-way connection standard between the client and the server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
3.  **MCP Server**: Translates the external service's capabilities for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
4.  **Service**: The external tool or resource (e.g., a database, an email service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

Anthropic is noted for architecting MCP in a way that places the responsibility of constructing the MCP server on the service providers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This means service providers are now building out MCP servers to allow LLMs to access their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. This strategy aims to make LLMs more powerful and capable by ensuring external services adhere to a unified standard for integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Benefits and [[technical_challenges_and_future_of_mcp | Technical Challenges and Future of MCP]]

### Benefits
*   **Unified Communication**: MCP unifies the LLM and the service, creating an efficient communication layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Seamless Integration**: It makes integrating LLMs with various tools significantly easier and more cohesive, reducing the "nightmare" of manual configuration and edge cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Increased LLM Capability**: By providing a standard for interaction, MCP makes LLMs more capable of performing meaningful and complex tasks beyond simple text prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

### [[technical_challenges_and_future_of_mcp | Technical Challenges and Future of MCP]]
While promising, MCP is not without its current hurdles:
*   **Setup Complexity**: Setting up an MCP server can be "annoying," involving local file movements and configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **Early Stages**: The standard is still early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, with kinks to be ironed out, and potential updates or new standards might emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

Despite these challenges, MCP is seen as the "next Evolution" for making LLMs more capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## [[potential_opportunities_with_mcp_in_startups | Potential Opportunities with MCP in Startups]]

For technical individuals, Professor Ross Mike suggests ideas like an **MCP App Store** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. This concept would allow users to browse different MCP servers from repositories, click "install" or "deploy," receive a URL, and paste it into an MCP client to integrate services easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

For non-technical individuals and entrepreneurs, the advice is to **stay informed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>:
*   Keep a close watch on platforms building out MCP capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   Observe how the standards evolve and when they become finalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

> "When the right thing at the right time happens you strike" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

While it's too early for concrete business decisions based solely on MCP, understanding this technology is crucial for comprehending future developments in AI. The ability to seamlessly integrate different services with LLMs, akin to stacking Lego pieces, will open up new possibilities for user experiences and complex AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

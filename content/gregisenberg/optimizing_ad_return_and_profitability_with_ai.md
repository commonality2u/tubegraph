Leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to [[using_ai_for_ad_creation_and_strategy | create winning ads]] can significantly enhance a business's return on ad spend (ROAS) and overall profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The key lies in mastering AI tools like ChatGPT-4o to generate high-performing visual content and ad copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Power of AI in Ad Creation

AI allows businesses to [[leveraging_ai_for_ad_creation_and_iteration | experiment with ads at scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, which is crucial for identifying ad variations that convert best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This capability enables rapid iteration on different audiences, visuals, and messaging to optimize performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Mastering ChatGPT-4o for Ad Generation

ChatGPT-4o is a multimodal language model that excels at understanding intent and creativity, making prompting less complex than with other image models like Midjourney or Ideogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Prompting Strategies

*   **Inspiration and Product Images**: For effective ads, providing clear inspiration images and your own product images is more crucial than elaborate text prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The model's intelligence helps it understand intentions well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **When to Use Reference Images**:
    *   **New/Small Brands**: Always provide a reference image if your product or brand is relatively new, small, or lacks significant online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
    *   **Well-Known Brands**: Reference images are less critical for widely recognized brands like Nike or Adidas, as the model already has a strong understanding of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Keywords for Photo Realism**: Use terms like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to ensure the generated images don't default to a cartoonish appearance or strange colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Font and Style Control**: For well-known fonts, the model has a decent understanding, allowing users to specify font types (e.g., "exo2 bold italic") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. You can also adjust color styles and aspect ratios within the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Degradation**: If an initial prompt doesn't yield desired results, it's better to start a new chat for adjustments rather than continuing in the same conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This prevents the model from referencing its own potentially flawed AI-generated images, which can lead to worse results over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Explicit Image Generation**: To ensure the AI generates an image instead of text describing an ad, explicitly state "generate the image" in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Practical Applications and Examples

AI-powered [[using_ai_for_ad_creation_and_strategy | ad creation]] can be applied to various scenarios:

*   **Adjusting Existing Ads (Jones Road Beauty)**: Users can provide an inspiration ad and a product image, then instruct the AI to combine elements, such as placing the product image overlapping the bottom of the inspiration ad with specific headings and subheadings below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This method allows for consistent, reliable ad creation by making minor adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Creative Ad Concepts (Adidas)**: Without reference images, detailed prose descriptions can generate unique and imaginative ads, like a female runner in performance gear with Egyptian pyramids in the background, shaped like the Adidas logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Remixing Ads for Competitors (Athletic Greens)**: An existing ad (e.g., for Rise) can be "remixed" for another brand (e.g., AG1) by providing the new product imagery and clear instructions to adjust the background, change pricing, and generate the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This practice, while appearing "dirty" to some, reflects how most companies already adapt inspiration and templates in the ad industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Changing Ad Concepts/Themes (Ridge Wallet)**: An existing ad can be transformed by swapping product images and changing the concept, such as converting a Black Friday ad into a Christmas-themed ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. This demonstrates how a simple prompt with a reference image can yield creative results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

## Leveraging News Cycles and Trends

AI enables companies to capitalize on short new cycle moments faster than ever before, as the process is no longer prohibitively expensive or slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. AI can be set up to monitor news feeds and generate relevant ads on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## Finding Ad Inspiration

Several platforms offer ad inspiration and templating tools by reading and tagging content from the Meta Ad Library, making it searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>:
*   Creative OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>
*   ForPlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   Icon.me <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>

Sora also offers an explore page where users can see how others are prompting and gain ideation by viewing the prompts used for any image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Sora is noted for its strong photo realism and less strict policy guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Live Demo: Creating an Ad for LCA

The process for creating a new ad involves:

1.  **Defining the Brand and Vibe**: For LCA, the desired aesthetic was a "luxury product" with a "SWAT team" feel, working with top companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
2.  **Gathering Source Material**: Screenshots of the company's logo, key text (like partner brands), and an inspiration image (e.g., a vintage Rolex ad for a luxury feel) are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
3.  **Crafting the Initial Prompt**: A somewhat vague but descriptive prompt can be used to allow the AI to leverage its creativity, stating the company's nature, its clientele, and the desired "luxury vibe" from the inspiration image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.
4.  **Iterative Refinement**:
    *   The first generated ad might include elements from the inspiration image (e.g., a Rolex watch) that need to be replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.
    *   To refine, start a new chat and provide clearer instructions, such as replacing the watch with company logos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
    *   Model "temperature" affects randomness; a low temperature means similar prompts yield similar results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.
    *   While the model might hallucinate minor details (e.g., including a Disney logo when LCA doesn't work with them), overall, it captures the intended vibe and integrates provided elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.
    *   Specific layout preferences (e.g., text on the side, image on the right) can be added to the prompt for further guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.
5.  **Dimensions**: ChatGPT-4o usually defaults to a 9:16 aspect ratio, but users can specify dimensions like 1:1 or 9:16 in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

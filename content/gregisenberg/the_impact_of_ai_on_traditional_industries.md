The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and large language models like ChatGPT is creating new business opportunities and reshaping existing ones, demonstrating significant [[impact_of_ai_on_business_and_entrepreneurship | impact on business and entrepreneurship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This shift is particularly evident in the emergence of specialized AI-powered applications, often built as "wrappers" around existing AI models.

## AI-Powered Business Models

One notable example is the "Riz app," an [[applications_and_implications_of_ai_in_different_industries | AI dating coach]] built on top of ChatGPT, which reportedly generated $190,000 per month and saw 333,000 downloads monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. The idea for this app originated from a Tinder subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This success story illustrates how [[applications_and_implications_of_ai_in_different_industries | AI wrappers]] focusing on niche markets can achieve substantial revenue with minimal proprietary product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

### Case Study: AI RZ and its Portfolio

A 23-year-old co-founded a small development studio, AI RZ, that has launched three applications, collectively closing in on $500,000 of revenue per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. This studio exemplifies [[leveraging_ai_in_existing_business_models | leveraging AI]] to create focused [[applications_and_implications_of_ai_in_different_industries | AI coaching]] solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>:

*   **Plug AI (also known as Riz):** A texting assistant that provides pickup lines based on screenshots of text messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:42]</a>. It functions as the "ultimate AI Riz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a> and is currently ranked as the number 27 lifestyle app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>.
*   **Astra:** Offers life advice, helping users with challenges, compatibility discussions, personal growth, and dream interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.
*   **Pallet:** Uses [[applications_and_implications_of_ai_in_different_industries | AI]] to determine a user's color season from a selfie, generating custom color palettes, style, and makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

These apps demonstrate a strategy of focusing on specific verticals rather than attempting to be an app for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

### Key Factors for Success in AI Wrappers
Success in the AI wrapper space often relies on strong marketing and branding rather than deep product innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. A memorable brand name, like "Riz" (a term for romantic aptitude among youth), and effective in-app referral flows are crucial for virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

## Sustainability and [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_ai_integration | Challenges for AI Integration]]

While lucrative, businesses built on AI wrappers face inherent risks, particularly their dependence on underlying AI models like OpenAI's GPT. A significant increase in API costs or a change in service availability could impact their profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>. Despite these risks, the financial gains and transferable business skills acquired make such ventures worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>. The founder of AI RZ, for instance, is diversifying by developing multiple apps, reducing the risk associated with a single product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.

> "Okay but like so what, so what this guy's making $500,000 a month in Revenue. Yeah you're learn he's also learning how to run a business the skills that he's learning while doing this are going to be transferable to whatever he makes next." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49:00">[23:49:00]</a>

## The "Anti-Trend" Opportunity

The rise of AI-powered solutions also creates an "anti-trend" opportunity for human-powered services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. As AI becomes more prevalent in areas like coaching or style advice, there may be an increasing demand for human interaction, potentially at a premium price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>. This presents an avenue for competition, where human-led services can leverage the same marketing strategies as their AI counterparts but offer a more personalized, human touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.

> "You're right there's going to be an equal Demand on The Human Side and you might be able to charge a premium for it and it actually might be better business than some of these AI businesses." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>

Such "anti-trends" often face less [[the_impact_of_competition_on_ai_startups | competition]] compared to the crowded AI assistant market, where new products emerge daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: Changing Your World Before Changing The World

The current landscape demonstrates that [[impact_of_ai_on_business_and_entrepreneurship | leveraging AI]] to build profitable businesses, even if perceived as "flash in the pan" or "hypey," can provide significant financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:00">[24:54:00]</a>. For many entrepreneurs, the goal is to achieve personal financial freedom or provide for family, which can then serve as a foundation for future, larger-scale endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

> "Sometimes you need to change your world before you change the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>

This perspective emphasizes the practical financial benefits of seizing immediate opportunities presented by technologies like AI, even if they don't initially aim to "change the world" on a global scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>.

This article explores how to leverage data and trends to develop CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) businesses, with lessons applicable to software startups as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Ashwin, an expert in launching and growing consumer brands, shares insights on evaluating market opportunities and understanding demand before building a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Utilizing Ahrefs for Market Analysis and SEO

Ahrefs is a powerful tool primarily used for SEO (Search Engine Optimization), but it also serves as an excellent resource for evaluating category demand and trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Key Features of Ahrefs
Ahrefs allows users to type in any keyword and gain insights into:
*   **Search Volume**: The general volume of searches on Google for a specific keyword, term, or brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Keyword Difficulty (KD)**: A ranking from 0 to 100 that indicates how difficult it would be to rank for that term on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]">[00:06:34]</a>. A high KD signifies significant competition, requiring substantial time, money, and SEO expertise to rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Practical Applications
*   **Identifying Category Demand**: For example, "electrolytes" shows good search volume and a rising trend, particularly in June and July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. However, its high keyword difficulty (88) indicates intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Geographic Opportunities**: Analyzing global search volume can reveal underserved markets. For instance, while electrolytes are popular in English-speaking Western countries, there might be opportunities to launch similar products in Germany, India, or the Philippines where demand is currently lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This strategy, common among German tech startups, involves replicating proven business models in new geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Valuating Web Properties**: Ahrefs can help identify undervalued web properties with existing search demand. An example is a friend who used Ahrefs to find Solitaire websites with millions of monthly visitors, aiming to acquire and then out-SEO them to rank higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This demonstrates how [[keyword_research_for_content_marketing | keyword research]] can translate into profitable ventures.

### Asking "Why"
It's crucial to go beyond just looking at the data in Ahrefs and ask "why" trends are occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. For example, CBD search volume exploded in 2019 due to the 2018 Farm Bill, then declined as Delta-9 THC grew in popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Understanding the underlying reasons for trends is key to [[evaluating_market_opportunities_with_data_tools | evaluating market opportunities]].

## Particle for E-commerce Analysis and Trend Exploration

Particle is a specialized tool for analyzing e-commerce brands, providing insights typically not publicly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### Key Features of Particle
*   **Sales Over Time**: Track the sales performance of any e-commerce brand directly from their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   **Product Categories and Best-Selling SKUs**: Identify which product categories a brand operates in and their top-selling products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This helps de-risk product decisions by showing that a significant portion of a company's revenue often comes from a few core products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   **Trend Explorer**: Particle includes its own feature for exploring product and category trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

### Additional Sales Data Sources
Platforms like TikTok Shop and Amazon also display sales figures, offering additional avenues to gauge demand and competition within physical product categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

## Identifying Market Gaps and Differentiation Strategies

Even with high category demand, standing out is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. Successful brands differentiate themselves through:

*   **Branding and Aesthetics**: Many products, especially in the supplement market (e.g., magnesium glycinate), often have a generic, medical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Brands like Moon Juice differentiate with visually striking packaging (e.g., amber jars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. Lemi, a brand by Kourtney Kardashian, invested in custom bottling, cool ridges, and specific colors (purple) to appeal to a Gen Z female audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.
*   **Positioning and Audience Niche**: Successfully targeting a specific niche, such as a Gen Z woman with Lemi or a performance-oriented audience with Seed, allows brands to gain traction before expanding their appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.
*   **Underserved Demographics**: Many consumer products are designed by and for a narrow demographic (e.g., coastal people aged 22-35), leading to market saturation and "Millennial blanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. This creates significant opportunities to apply well-designed branding to products for underserved groups, such as older adults who may have more disposable income and consume information from less saturated channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Market Research and Design

New [[ai_tools_for_small_businesses | AI tools for small businesses]] and [[ai_tools_for_startup_ideas | AI tools for startup ideas]] are revolutionizing market research and product development:

*   **Manis**: This AI tool can conduct in-depth market research, analyze competitors (e.g., Starface), identify product details, and research specific skincare needs for target demographics (e.g., older adults) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. This capability can provide an [[ai_and_seo_opportunities | unfair advantage]] by generating comprehensive reports that previously cost thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>.
*   **AI for Design**: Tools like Midjourney can generate initial design concepts (V1) for packaging and branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. These AI-generated designs can then be refined by freelance designers found on platforms like Fiverr or Upwork for a low cost (e.g., $250) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This approach allows for bootstrapping initial ideas and clarifying a vision before investing heavily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

## Working Backwards from Distribution

A core principle for any startup, whether software or physical products, is to "work backwards from distribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. This means:
*   **Focus on Customer Acquisition Channels**: Identify and prioritize the channels through which you will acquire customers and where you can achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.
*   **Build Product Second**: Contrary to common belief, product development should follow the distribution strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>. As the adage goes, "first-time founders focus on product, second-time founders focus on distribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>. Strong distribution and operational excellence can drive success even for "subpar" products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.

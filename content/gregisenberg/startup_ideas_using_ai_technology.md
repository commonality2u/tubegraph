This episode features Omar, who creates "incredible Disney-style content" and images that feel like Pixar, demonstrating how such creations can drive revenue for businesses through marketing and storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The episode provides a tutorial on various AI tools and sprinkles in numerous [[ai_startup_ideas_and_market_opportunities | startup ideas]] that can generate revenue and cash flow immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The goal is to show how to assemble an AI SaaS product that can "literally print you cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## The New Business Landscape

Significant transitions in business, particularly with tech products, have occurred in product, marketing, and operations, largely influenced by COVID-19 and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

*   **Product**: Traditionally, launching a product required years, raising VC capital, and hiring many software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Now, with AI, products can be built instantly, at low cost, and with zero employees, eliminating the need for engineers in many initial stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: The shift is towards "always-on" storytelling and transparency, where founders like Peter Levels, Danny Postma, and Mark Lou share their journeys and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This contrasts with traditional seasonal big campaigns and requires less social media budget or creative teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Operations**: There's been a cultural shift towards remote working, reducing office costs and allowing talent acquisition from anywhere globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Businesses can now build faster with fewer people, operating much leaner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

This new reality forces a rewire of thinking; the old ways of doing things are no longer the only, or even best, option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. A single individual can now perform the job of five or six people using AI tools like ChatGPT or Leonardo AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## Core Concept: Sequential Prompting

Omar introduces a third technique for [[how_to_effectively_use_ai_tools_in_startups | using AI tools]], beyond conversational and master prompts, called **sequential prompting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

The idea is that ChatGPT can be used to generate prompts for *other* AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This process involves:
1.  Using ChatGPT to generate a prompt.
2.  Taking that prompt and feeding it into a different AI tool (e.g., Leonardo AI, Cling AI, Eleven Labs) to generate another output (e.g., an image) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
3.  Carrying that output to further AI tools for more transformations (e.g., animating an image with Cling AI, adding voiceovers with Eleven Labs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

This sequence connects prompts and tools together, potentially with a user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. It's recommended to perform this process manually first for iteration and feedback, then automate it using tools like Zapier or Make, or by hiring an engineer for more complex integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## [[ai_powered_startup_ideas | AI Powered Startup Ideas]]

### 1. AI Avatar-Based Storytelling & Custom Content

This idea centers on creating compelling stories and content using AI-generated 3D characters, leveraging the appeal of Pixar/Disney animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

**Workflow Example: Creating a Consistent Character**
1.  **Image Upload to ChatGPT**: Provide ChatGPT with an image reference (e.g., a child's photo) and basic details (name, age, gender) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
2.  **Prompt Generation by ChatGPT**: ChatGPT assesses the image and generates a detailed prompt describing the character's style, hairstyle, skin tone, accessories, and outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. This prompt ensures character consistency across different generated images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
3.  **Image Creation with Leonardo AI**: The generated prompt is then used in Leonardo AI (via its API for automation) to create high-resolution, Disney/Pixar-style images of the character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. This process is incredibly fast, taking only a few seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
4.  **Video Animation with Cling AI**: The generated images can be uploaded to Cling AI to turn them into short video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Cling AI also offers a "dub" feature for lip-syncing characters to spoken words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. While video generation is currently slower (4 minutes for a 5-second clip), it's expected to accelerate with tools like Sora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
5.  **Voiceovers with Eleven Labs**: For full animation, Eleven Labs can be used to add voiceovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

**Specific Business Applications for AI Avatars:**

*   **Personalized Greeting Cards/Invites (AI Moonpig)**: Create an "AI-first" version of services like Moonpig.com, which generates $400 million in revenue annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>. Users upload photos, and AI generates personalized cards with animated characters. This can include:
    *   Dynamic character and scene creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.
    *   AI-generated mini-stories for each card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.
    *   AI-enhanced templates adapting to user inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.
    *   Integration of generated voiceovers or short animated videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.
    *   Potential for premium sales (20-30% markup), monthly memberships, and upsell of related gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
    *   An example UI called "Teeny Tales" was designed for creating custom storybooks for children, where users input child's name, age, upload an image, and AI generates an interactive story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.
*   **Memifying Moments**: Generate cartoon-style memes or short animated GIFs based on photos or current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. This could be for fun, internal group chats, or even a dedicated meme page for marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **Educational Content**: Create engaging, AI-driven educational systems by generating stories and images based on school curricula, making learning more interactive for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. This could be a B2B or B2S (business to school) model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>.

### 2. Personalized AI Stickers

This [[innovative_startup_ideas_using_ai_technology | startup idea]] involves creating custom, personalized stickers using AI avatars, leveraging print-on-demand services for automated fulfillment.

**Workflow for Personalized Stickers**
1.  **Prompt for Artwork (ChatGPT)**: Use ChatGPT to generate a "kiss-cut sticker artwork" prompt, detailing the character, scene, and desired text (e.g., "Congratulations") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
2.  **Image Generation (Leonardo AI)**: Input the prompt into Leonardo AI to generate the sticker image, ensuring settings like "prompt enhance" are off and the aspect ratio is 1:1 for stickers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
3.  **Background Removal (Remove.bg)**: Use Remove.bg (or its API) to automatically remove the background, creating a clean PNG sticker image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.
4.  **Printing & Fulfillment (Printful)**: Connect the process to a print-on-demand API like Printful. This allows for automated order placement and fulfillment of physical stickers or other products (like clothing) without manual intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

**Marketing Strategy**
A "gorilla hacking" marketing technique involves targeting schools. Find faculty directories on school websites, take a principal's image, generate personalized sticker sheets with their AI avatar, and mail them to the school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>. This unexpected, personalized product is likely to go viral within the school and gain attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>. Alternatively, use social media display pictures to generate avatars and DM potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

## Conclusion

The combination of AI tools and sequential prompting allows for the creation of lean, fast, and highly engaging products with significant revenue potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. The key is to build a user interface and a brand experience around powerful AI models, creating specific use cases that solve niche problems or tap into emotional connections, such as personalized storytelling for families or fun, engaging content for social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.

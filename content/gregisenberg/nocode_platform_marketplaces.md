This article explores the concept of creating specialized, product-specific no-code tools and marketplaces, inspired by ideas from Danny Grant. The core idea is to "unbundle" large platforms like Shopify by offering focused no-code solutions for various niches, fostering new opportunities for [[aidriven_app_development_using_nocode_tools | AI-driven app development using no-code tools]] and [[opportunities_in_app_development_for_specific_niches | app development for specific niches]].

### The "Shopify for X" Concept
Shopify, an $80 billion company, demonstrates the massive potential of no-code e-commerce solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The idea of "unbundling" Shopify suggests creating similar product-specific no-code tools for other areas, leading to [[shopifylike_platforms_for_different_niches | Shopify-like platforms for different niches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

Danny Grant proposes that while existing [[nocode_ai_tools_for_workflow_automation | no-code tools]] can be either too limited or too complex, there's a need for product-specific tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

### Vision for Nocode Marketplaces
The vision includes building:
*   No-code marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>
*   No-code messaging apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>
*   No-code Instagram-like apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>

This concept is highly regarded as something that "needs to exist, should exist, will exist," indicating it's considered the direction things are headed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

### Utility and Business Model
These marketplaces for no-code apps would allow users to:
*   Go to the marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>
*   Duplicate an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>
*   Pay a monthly or one-time license fee for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>

While platforms like Bubble are already doing "pieces of that," there's an opportunity to build on top of or alongside them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

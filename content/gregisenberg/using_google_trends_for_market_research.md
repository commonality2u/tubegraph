[[identifying_niche_markets_using_data | Identifying niche markets]] and validating startup ideas without building them is possible by leveraging tools like Google Trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This approach helps determine demand and understand potential customer bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Kettle and Fire: A Case Study in Validation

Justin Mayers, founder of Kettle and Fire, a business now valued at over $100 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, detailed his "day zero" steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> to validate the idea in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Identifying the Problem and Niche
Mayers, then working at Rackspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, was inspired to start his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. He had heard about bone broth from friends in the CrossFit community and had been reading about its benefits for skin, gut, and joint health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. At this time, bone broth was not widely discussed or easily found online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

His primary questions were:
1.  How many people want this product? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
2.  Are there enough of them, or will they spend enough to support a meaningful business? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>

### Micro and Macro Validation
To answer these questions, Mayers combined micro and macro research:
*   **Micro-level**: He analyzed online communities where his target audience (paleo and CrossFit enthusiasts) congregated, such as Mark's Daily Apple, Paleo Hacks, and Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. He observed how much traffic these sites received and how engaged threads discussing bone broth for various health benefits were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The high engagement, with discussions on recipes and sourcing, indicated a "small but fanatic" group of interested individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Macro-level**: He then used Google Trends to see if "bone broth" was gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The trend showed it was "starting to take off," with more people discussing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

This dual approach confirmed sufficient interest to pursue the idea, initially aiming for a business that could generate $10,000 a month in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### The Role of Google Trends in Personal Problem Solving
Mayers emphasized that while Google Trends was a validation tool, the initial idea stemmed from a personal need and passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. He sought bone broth for his own gut, skin, and joint health, and people he respected were also discussing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Google Trends merely served to "validate that this would be a decent business as opposed to just like Justin's side project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. He affirmed that if Google Trends showed "no sign of life," and subsequent validation steps failed, he would not have started the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Validating Economic Viability
After confirming market interest, Mayers tested willingness to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>:
1.  He purchased a cheap domain, bonebroths.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
2.  He spent $5 on Fiverr for a basic logo and renders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
3.  He created a landing page using Unbounce, highlighting value propositions such as healing leaky gut, convenience, organic ingredients, and health benefits like 100% grass-fed bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
4.  He set a price of $29.99 for 16 ounces, significantly higher than typical grocery store broth, to ensure profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
5.  The "Order Bone Broth Now" button redirected to his personal PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
6.  He spent about $100 on [[using_youtube_and_google_ads_as_a_marketing_strategy | Bing ads]] (chosen because they were cheaper than Google Ads) to drive traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

Despite a "super sketchy checkout flow" and no actual product in stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, the two-week test yielded nearly $500 in revenue with a 30% conversion rate for clicking the order button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. This confirmed people's willingness to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Post-Validation Strategy
After validating demand and willingness to pay, Mayers emailed customers, explaining the product wasn't in stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. He offered a full refund or a 50% discount for future delivery. Most opted for the discount, showing continued high interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. It took eight months to actually develop and scale the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## Modern Market Research and Validation (2025 Perspective)
In 2025, Mayers notes that the process would be even more streamlined with current tools:
*   **Improved Design**: Landing pages and logos would be significantly better using modern design tools or [[ai_trends_and_trend_analysis_for_startups | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Sentiment Analysis**: [[analyzing_trends_for_ai_startups | AI and other tools]] can quickly scrape and analyze sentiment across platforms like Reddit and Twitter, providing deeper insights into community discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Rapid Prototyping**: Tools like Bolt.new and modern AI models (Claude, GPT, Gemini) enable individuals to build and test startups in a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. This significantly lowers barriers to building CPG brands, from design to marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

> "The core thing of like try and sell a product even if it doesn't exist now and see if people will give you money for it... you'll very quickly understand is this a thing that people care enough about or not." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>

## Overarching Philosophy

Mayers advises aspiring entrepreneurs to:
*   **Focus on Passion**: Choose a problem or area where you are "on the frontier" and among the "most interested like top .1% of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This natural interest leads to new and interesting ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Address Major Problems**: Identifying significant world problems, such as the chronic disease crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, can lead to successful businesses if a solution is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
*   **Validate Relentlessly**: Regardless of the industry (CPG or software), the core principle remains: validate the market, understand pain points, and leverage available data and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. The ability to distill community sentiment and use tools like Bolt.new to quickly build and launch landing pages makes it easier than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

This strategy empowers individuals to compete with larger teams by quickly building products and validating visions using powerful, accessible tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

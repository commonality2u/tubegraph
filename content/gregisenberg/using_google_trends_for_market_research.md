By the end of this episode, listeners will understand the initial steps taken to launch Kettle and Fire, which grew into a nine-figure annual business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Validating a Startup Idea: The Kettle and Fire Case Study

In 2014, Justin Mayers sought to start his own company while working at Rackspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. He had heard about bone broth from friends in the CrossFit community and was reading about its benefits for skin, gut, and joint health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. At the time, bone broth was not widely discussed, and it was difficult to find online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Justin identified a product he personally wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. His main questions were:
1.  How many people genuinely want this product? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
2.  Are there enough people, or will they spend enough, to build a meaningful business? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>

### Step 1: Assessing Community Engagement

To answer the first question, Justin investigated where the target audience (people in the paleo and CrossFit communities) congregated online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. He checked platforms like Mark's Daily Apple, Paleo Hacks, and [[identifying_trends_and_opportunities_on_reddit | Reddit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. He observed the traffic and engagement levels on threads discussing bone broth's benefits for skin, gut, and joint health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The high level of engagement, with discussions on recipes, bone sourcing, and cooking times, indicated a "small but fanatic" and interested group of people in these niche communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Step 2: Macro Trend Analysis with Google Trends

After assessing micro-community interest, Justin looked at the macro trend using [[using_google_trends_for_startup_ideation | Google Trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. He observed that "bone broth" was "starting to take off," with more and more people discussing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Based on both the community engagement and the [[using_google_trends_for_startup_ideation | Google Trends]] data, Justin concluded that at least "several thousand people" were interested in bone broth and actively looking for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. His initial goal was to build a business that could generate $10,000 profit per month for him and his brother, aiming for a $200,000 per year business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This target only required a few thousand customers spending a couple of hundred dollars per year each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Combining Micro and Macro Research
> Justin emphasizes that while [[using_google_trends_for_startup_ideation | Google Trends]] was a validation tool, the initial idea stemmed from solving his own problem and being deeply passionate about the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. If [[using_google_trends_for_startup_ideation | Google Trends]] had shown no interest, he would not have proceeded with the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The role of [[using_google_trends_for_startup_ideation | Google Trends]] was to validate that it could be a "decent business" beyond just a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Modern Tools for Trend Analysis

In 2025, while the core principle of validating demand remains the same, new [[trend_analysis_using_ai | AI]] and [[growing_businesses_using_online_tools_and_trends | data tools]] offer significant advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>:

*   **Improved Landing Pages:** [[trend_analysis_using_ai | AI]] can create much better landing pages than the tools available in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Tools like Bolt.new and Unbounce can be used to build and launch landing pages quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>, enabling a startup to be launched in a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** [[trend_analysis_using_ai | AI]] and other [[tools for analyzing market trends | tools]] can quickly scrape and analyze sentiment across platforms like [[identifying_trends_and_opportunities_on_reddit | Reddit]], forums, and Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This helps in understanding what people are saying and the problems they care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Rapid Prototyping and Design:** Advanced [[trend_analysis_using_ai | AI]] models like ChatGPT-4o can assist with product design and branding. What once cost $60,000 for an agency might now be achievable for $20-200 a month using [[trend_analysis_using_ai | AI]] tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. This drastically lowers barriers to entry for CPG brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

### Beyond Trends: Passion and Problem Solving

Justin advises aspiring entrepreneurs to focus on problems that "light them up" or that they find deeply interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Being on the "frontier" of interest in a topic, perhaps among the top 0.1% most interested, naturally leads to new, interesting, and different ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Solving significant problems that people care about, such as the chronic disease crisis related to food systems, can lead to highly successful businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

The key is to find a problem you care about, validate the market and pain points by looking at communities and data, and then use modern [[growing_businesses_using_online_tools_and_trends | tools]] to distill that data and build a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

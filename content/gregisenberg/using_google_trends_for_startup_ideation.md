[[using_google_trends_for_market_research | Google Trends]] is a valuable and often underrated tool for identifying both market trends and [[antitrends_in_startup_ideas | anti-trends]], which can lead to unique startup opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. It's a completely free tool that provides insights into search interest over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## Identifying Trends and Anti-Trends

When considering startup ideas, it's beneficial to analyze trends and their opposites, [[trends_and_antitrends_in_startups | anti-trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While many gravitate towards popular trends like AI, considering an "AI-free" approach might reveal significant demand and offer a competitive moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

For instance, the "slow living" [[antitrends_in_startup_ideas | anti-trend]] emerged as an opposite to the prevalent "hustle culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. [[using_google_trends_for_market_research | Google Trends]] can be used to observe the growth of such concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## How to Use Google Trends for Ideation

1.  **Search for a Trend or Anti-Trend:** Input a term, such as "slow living," into [[using_google_trends_for_market_research | Google Trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
2.  **Analyze Search Volume Over Time:** Observe the trend over a specific period (e.g., the last five years) to see if it's progressively going up, indicating sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This steady growth is often preferred over erratic, high-growth trends, as it suggests a more sustainable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
3.  **Explore Related Searches and Questions:**
    *   **"People also search for"**: This section reveals other topics frequently searched by the same audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   **"Questions"**: This is a crucial section as it directly puts you "in the mind of people" interested in the topic, revealing their pain points and curiosities (e.g., "What is slow living?", "How to practice slow living?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. These questions can directly inform product or service ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
4.  **Utilize the Glimpse Chrome Extension:** This free extension "supercharges" [[using_google_trends_for_market_research | Google Trends]] by adding features like detailed related trends and social media activity mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   **Related Trends:** Glimpse provides more in-depth related trends, prompting further thought on why certain terms are connected (e.g., "food sustainability" in relation to "slow living") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   **Social Media Activity:** It shows where the most activity for a topic occurs (e.g., Instagram vs. Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This can inform your audience-building strategy; for example, choosing a platform with less competition, like LinkedIn for a health coach targeting busy entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
    *   **Topic Map, Related Topics, and Queries:** These features provide a bird's-eye view of the landscape and highlight "breakout topics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
5.  **Discover Trends Tab (Glimpse):** The Discover Trends tab within Glimpse allows you to explore trending topics in various categories (e.g., Home Improvement), showing search volume and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

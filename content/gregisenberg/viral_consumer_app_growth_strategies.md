Joseph Choy, an expert in [[building_consumer_mobile_apps | consumer app]] growth, reveals the formula behind apps achieving millions of downloads by mastering TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This strategy is offered freely, despite others charging thousands for similar insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## TikTok as an Underpriced Distribution Channel

TikTok organic reach is identified as the biggest underpriced [[marketing_and_distribution_strategies_for_ai_apps | distribution channel]] currently available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The cost of creating and distributing content on the platform is extremely low, making it accessible for all types of [[building_consumer_mobile_apps | consumer apps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Companies have achieved millions of downloads and significant monthly revenue through TikTok-first strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Lessons from E-commerce Marketing

Many successful app growth tactics are "stolen" from the e-commerce space, especially since the launch of TikTok Shop in November 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This space is still very new, offering significant opportunity for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### UGC and Mass Content Production
Tabs Chocolate, an e-commerce company, grew from zero to $10 million annually by employing mass user-generated content (UGC) creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. They hired numerous teenagers, organized them in a Discord server, and mass-produced content daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The founder has since pivoted to a micro-SaaS business, applying the same [[marketing_and_distribution_strategies_for_ai_apps | marketing and distribution strategies]] to achieve higher margins and exit multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### AI-Generated Content
AI-generated content is increasingly used for viral videos. For example, a colostrum supplement video that garnered 700,000 views used Midjourney for its images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The POV app, a disposable camera app, also uses Midjourney for realistic faces in its wedding-themed slideshows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Identify a working content format and "spam" it daily, relying on AI tools like Midjourney for visual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Content Formats: Slideshows vs. Talking Head Videos
While TikTok is often associated with short-form videos, carousels (slideshows) are proving highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Slideshows:** Generally lower converting than talking head videos due to less human connection, but offer significantly higher scale and lower barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. They are also less competitive than talking head videos for affiliate marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Talking Head Videos:** Influencers directly speak to the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Brands like Goalie (a supplement company) incentivize creators with lavish prizes (MacBook Pro, Rolex, Tesla) on top of affiliate commissions, making it difficult for competitors to use this approach profitably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

## Finding and Leveraging TikTok Shop Creators

The TikTok Shop Affiliate Center provides valuable data on high-volume product sales, allowing filtering by industry and creator performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### The Opportunity for Apps
Many TikTok Shop creators are incentivized to sell e-commerce products, but they could be selling apps instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This represents a significant untapped opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Example:** "What Colors" is an AI-powered color analysis app that helps users determine clothing and makeup colors that suit their skin tone and hair color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. It promotes itself through simple slideshow videos with a call to action to download from the App Store, achieving millions of likes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Idea:** Create a skincare app that analyzes a face and suggests products, mimicking the "What Colors" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

### Product as a Utility for Creators
A key strategy is to create an app that helps existing TikTok Shop creators sell their products better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **Example:** A skincare analysis app could enable creators to make "before and after" videos, scanning their face with the app to show transformation. The app becomes a utility within their content, potentially leading to free marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
*   This approach can be applied across numerous niches where creators sell physical products, including makeup, personal care, fashion, electronics, sports, and home improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

## Monetization and User Acquisition

Apps offer lower customer acquisition costs than physical products, as it's easier to convince someone to download a $5 app than to spend $100 on an unknown product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

### Subscription Models and Apple Pay
Many successful single-utility apps use a paywall after onboarding, charging weekly or annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. The ease of "Double Tap to Pay" with Apple Pay has significantly boosted iOS subscription revenue, changing user perception and willingness to pay for apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

### App Store Optimization (ASO) Synergy
While TikTok and Instagram Reels are today's primary discovery platforms for apps, driving top-of-funnel distribution through these channels leads to higher rankings in app stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. This boost then generates organic downloads through [[app_store_optimization_strategies | App Store Optimization Strategies]] (ASO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

## Targeting High LTV Niches

Focusing on niches with users willing to pay more can lead to higher revenue per user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

### Example: Golf Swing Analysis Apps
Golfers are a high-value demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. An AI golf coach app that analyzes swings via the phone camera and provides improvement tips is a promising idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. The top app in this niche reportedly generates $70,000 a month from 10,000 monthly downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. The alternative (in-person coaching) costs significantly more and is less convenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

### Example: Poker Strategy Apps
Poker players represent another high LTV niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. An app that analyzes hand history, strategies, or provides educational tips for beginners could be highly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. Many existing poker-related TikTok videos are unmonetized or under-monetized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>, offering an opportunity to integrate an app interface into gameplay videos casually to drive downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.

## Rethinking [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_apps | Influencer Marketing Strategies for Apps]] for TikTok

Traditional [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_apps | influencer marketing]] (paying influencers with millions of followers) is less effective on TikTok because users primarily watch content on the "For You Page" rather than from accounts they follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.

### Creators as Actors, Not Just Influencers
On TikTok, creators serve three potential roles: actor, director, and having a built-in audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Skip the "director" and "audience" roles. Hire creators solely as "actors" for their talent in front of the camera, regardless of their follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. This makes [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_apps | influencer marketing]] significantly cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

### Strategy: Multiple Brand Accounts
Once a content format proves successful, create new brand accounts dedicated to that specific format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>. This helps the TikTok algorithm serve content to the right audience more consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>. Mixing too many faces or content types on a single account can confuse the algorithm and hurt reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.
*   **Example:** Tabs Chocolate and Airbuds create multiple brand accounts (e.g., "Lila Airbuds," "Stacy Airbuds") using different small creators for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

## Capitalizing on Niche "Cult" Movements

Identifying and building products around existing niche movements or "cults" can lead to massive success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. Focus on universal human desires like health, wealth, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.

### Example: Looksmaxing (Umax app)
Umax is an app that scans a user's face, provides scores, and offers tips to improve physical appearance (jawline, skin, hair) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. It capitalized on the "looksmaxing" movement, a deep internet subculture focused on physical self-improvement, which has since gone mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>. The app generates millions in revenue annually, primarily through TikTok distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.

### Example: Making Money Online (Crayo app)
Crayo is an app that productizes the process of making money online for teenagers by automating video clipping and mass posting on TikTok and YouTube Shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>. It stemmed from YouTubers and TikTokers teaching these methods via courses, essentially building a "cult of young money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.

## Crucial Baseline: Product Quality and Retention

While distribution strategies are vital, the underlying product must be high-quality and retain users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. Without retention, marketing efforts lead to a "leaky bucket," making it an e-commerce model where products are sold only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. Understanding user acquisition, payment conversion, and retention metrics (LTV and CAC) allows for more effective and scalable marketing spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>.

Starting a startup can be daunting, but newsletters offer a "cheat code" to build a loyal audience, which can then serve as a foundation for various businesses, including marketplaces, agencies, or software companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Matt McGary, an expert in newsletters with 15.4 million email subscribers for clients, has outlined 10 amazing newsletter business ideas that can be launched quickly and have the potential to become multi-million dollar ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## 1. Marketing Newsletter for Global Talent
This idea targets overseas marketers seeking remote US-based marketing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. It addresses a skill gap where overseas marketers often work with significantly smaller budgets than their Western counterparts, limiting their exposure to high-budget strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Newsletter Structure
*   Remote marketing jobs for readers to apply to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   Relevant digital marketing news and updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   Actionable digital marketing tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### [[monetization_through_newsletters | Monetization Strategies]]
While subscribers from places like India or the Philippines might be cheap to acquire (25-50 cents per sub), the primary [[monetization_through_newsletters | monetization]] target is the Western audience looking to hire talented overseas marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Job Board**: Create a free job board where companies can post jobs, charging $300-$500 for a "boost" or feature in the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. These businesses are generally profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Sponsored Email Blasts**: Collect subscriber data (work experience, job title, company) at signup to send targeted sponsored emails on behalf of job advertisers. Charge $1,000-$3,000 per recruiting blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Partnerships with Recruiting Agencies**: Partner with or create an overseas recruiting agency. Partnering, similar to Nick Huber's collaboration with Somewhere.com, can involve generating leads for equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Courses**: Create courses focused on the international audience of marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Revenue Potential
With a $5,000 monthly budget and a 25-cent Cost Per Acquisition (CPA), you could acquire 20,000 new subscribers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Job Postings**: 5 jobs per newsletter at $300 each, sent 3 times a week, yields $1,500 per issue or $18,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Recruiting Blasts**: 5 blasts per month at $2,000 each generates $10,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Total Revenue**: Approximately $28,000 per month with an audience of 20,000-40,000 international marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## 2. Platform-Based Newsletter
This concept involves creating an educational newsletter that teaches people how to better use specific tools, platforms, or programs commonly used in an industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Examples include Ableton for music production, DaVinci for video editing, Notion for operations, Canva for graphics, or Perplexity AI for research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The key is to pick one tool and make its content digestible and delightful to consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### [[monetization_through_newsletters | Monetization Strategies]]
*   **Courses**: Building a course around mastering the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Partnerships**: Becoming an affiliate partner for the platform, potentially earning 20-50% recurring commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Templates**: Create and sell templates for the platform (e.g., a HubSpot template for $200) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. You can also offer these for free if subscribers sign up through your affiliate link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Software Sales**: Build your own SaaS tools that integrate with or complement the platform, using tools like Repet, Bolt, or VZ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## 3. Unofficial Sports Team Newsletter
Focus on a sports team with a large fanbase but limited media coverage, such as a local team, minor league team, or college team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Avoid major teams like the Dallas Cowboys due to oversaturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Content Sourcing
Instead of writing original content, curate the best takes from subreddits and forums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Linking out to these takes saves time and allows for horizontal scaling (e.g., creating five unofficial local sports newsletters quickly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### [[monetization_through_newsletters | Monetization Strategies]]
*   **Sponsors**: Attract sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Paid Community**: Create a paid Discord or Facebook community for fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Scaling**: To achieve significant revenue, you'll likely need a dozen newsletters for multiple teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

## 4. [[local_and_niche_newsletters | Local Real Estate Investor Newsletter]]
This concept targets local real estate investors in cities with populations ranging from 200,000 to one million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Examples like Bisnow Media and The Offer Sheet demonstrate the potential for millions in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

### Newsletter Content
*   **High-Quality Listings**: Include 10-20 high-quality investment properties sourced from Zillow or local realtors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This can be outsourced or automated with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Enriched Information**: Add potential mortgage rates, forecasted returns, and other valuable insights to make the newsletter more useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### [[newsletter_growth_strategies_and_lead_generation | Growth Strategies]]
*   **Facebook Ads**: Use Facebook ads to build the subscriber list, aiming for a CPA of $2 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **Local Groups/Subreddits**: Promote the newsletter in local Facebook groups and subreddits by adding value to posts and then linking out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Social Media CTAs**: Share pre and post Call-to-Actions (CTAs) on social media platforms like X, Instagram, and TikTok to tease content and drive subscribers to the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. The goal is to eventually reduce reliance on paid ads by building organic audience growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### [[monetization_through_newsletters | Monetization Strategies]]
*   **Ad Sales (Flat Fee)**: With 1,000-5,000 subscribers, approach local businesses and charge a flat fee (e.g., $2,500 upfront) to run an ad until it achieves an agreed number of clicks (e.g., 500 clicks at $5 per click) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Reinvest this revenue into ad spend for more subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
    *   **Ideal Sponsors**: Local businesses with high Lifetime Value (LTV) that already work with real estate investors, such as lawyers, accountants, bankers, and insurance brokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
*   **In-Person Seminars/Events**: Sell seats ($500-$1,000 each) to local real estate investment seminars or events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.
*   **Premium Subscriptions**: Put 50% of the property listings behind a paywall, charging $1,000 per year for access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

### Revenue Potential
Assuming a $2 CPA and a $5,000 monthly ad budget, plus organic growth, you can acquire 3,100 new subscribers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. With a 5,000-person list:
*   **Ad Sales**: Three "500 clicks" ads at $2,500 each per month result in $7,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Seminars**: If 2% of the list purchases a $500 seminar ticket, that's $50,000 in sales (not including sponsorship revenue for the event) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
*   **Premium Subscriptions**: If 1% converts to a $1,000/year premium subscription, that's $50,000 in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   **Total**: This model can generate $190,000 annually with an audience of 5,000-10,000 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. The economics improve with scale, and the business is highly sellable due to its sought-after audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

## 5. Newsletter for B2B Decision Makers
This type of newsletter doesn't require a massive audience; even 2,000 subscribers who are C-suite executives can be incredibly valuable to sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. The challenge is acquiring subscribers that fit the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

### How to Start
1.  **Pick a Niche**: Focus on one industry (e.g., CEOs at Fortune 500 oil and gas companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
2.  **Understand Info Diet**: Interview executives in your target industry about what they read and want to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. Create hyper-relevant content summarizing press releases, product launches, hiring/firing news, and earning reports into a 5-10 minute read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.
3.  **[[newsletter_growth_strategies_and_lead_generation | Acquire Subscribers]]**:
    *   Ask existing contacts to introduce you to their network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
    *   Share content on LinkedIn and X to drive traffic to your newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
    *   Advertise in other newsletters that your ICP reads, or do cross-promotions for free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

### [[monetization_through_newsletters | Monetization]] Critical Step
*   **Subscriber Data**: After people subscribe, use survey forms (e.g., Beehiiv) to ask for their job title, industry, company, and location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.
*   **Leverage for Sponsorships**: Analyze the data to determine the percentage of subscribers who are your ICP. If you can state that 50% are C-suite executives in a specific sector, you gain significant leverage when selling sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.
*   **Beyond Ads**: Beyond ads, events, and courses, consider [[profitable_startup_ideas | building an email-based business with newsletters | selling software]] to this high-value audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.

## 6. Niche Ad Examples for Media Buyers
Media buyers constantly need new ad creative examples. While some newsletters cover general ad inspiration, there's a lack of niche-specific newsletters for industries like SaaS, info products, or lead generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

### Newsletter Structure
*   Break the newsletter into 3-4 sections, each featuring ads from a different niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.
*   Create a spreadsheet to determine target niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
*   Source high-converting ads from Meta Ad Library by looking for ads live longest on high-spending accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.
*   Add 1-2 sentences of context for each ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

### [[monetization_through_newsletters | Monetization Strategies]]
*   **Paywall Content**: Put 80% of the content behind a paywall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.
*   **Canva Templates**: Create Canva templates for each ad that subscribers can download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   **Sponsorships**: Sell sponsorships to advertisers targeting paid marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.
*   **Community/Membership/Course**: Offer a community, membership, or course to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

## 7. This Week In Memes (Visual Newsletters)
Most newsletters are text-based, but 2025 is expected to see a rise in visual newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. This idea proposes explaining the news using memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

### Newsletter Structure
*   Find a big story from the day or week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.
*   Find a relevant meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.
*   Write a witty and concise summary (100-250 words) of the story below the meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   Cover 2-4 stories per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.
*   Memes can be sourced from Reddit, Twitter, or meme-specific sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

### [[monetization_through_newsletters | Monetization]] Considerations
*   Focus on a "prosumer" niche (business, tech, investing, finance) for more [[how_to_monetize_newsletters | monetization opportunities]] compared to general news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.
*   The core idea is to create more visual newsletters (using memes, infographics, GIFs) in spaces that lack them, making content feel less like "work to read" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.

## 8. Industry-Specific AI Tips and Tactics
This idea is modeled after "Write With AI," a paid newsletter that provides weekly Chat GPT and AI prompts, generating $200,000 in ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. The concept can be applied to any industry, such as "AI for Marketers" or "AI for Lawyers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

### Key to Success
*   Create content that provides readers with tangible results, such as "cheat codes" that save time and money with AI tools and tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.
*   While "Write With AI" leveraged an existing large social audience, the question for new entrants is whether this model is viable without one, potentially with a higher CPA (e.g., $20 per subscriber) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. People are increasingly willing to pay for content that saves them time or money in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

## 9. Lessons from Leaders or Inspirational Figures
This newsletter would feature highlights and lessons learned from inspirational leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. While trickier to monetize due to a less clear niche, it's excellent for rapid audience growth and viral social media content, especially on platforms like X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.

### Content Structure
*   Profile a leader (e.g., Warren Buffett) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
*   Include sections like: "Best Interview with X," "Best Quote from X," "Best Book about X," "Best Piece of Advice from X" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>.
*   Keep the newsletter super short (2-5 minutes max) with predictable formats and actionable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   Leverage Facebook targeting for people who like the featured leader, or target followers on platforms like X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

### [[monetization_through_newsletters | Monetization]] Opportunities
While potentially challenging to monetize broadly, focusing on leaders who attract a "prosumer" audience can open doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. For an investor-focused niche (e.g., Warren Buffett followers), ideas include:
*   **Raise a Fund**: Become a mini-Warren Buffett and raise a hedge fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.
*   **Consulting Agency**: Offer consulting on "How would Warren Buffett run your company?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.
*   **Courses**: Sell courses related to value investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.
*   **Stock Trading App**: Create an app focused on value investing principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.
*   **AI Agent**: Offer a paid AI agent that optimizes portfolios like Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

## 10. [[local_and_niche_newsletters | Local Newsletters]]
Despite traditional media shifting digitally, local news often lags behind, creating an opportunity for digestible, positive, community-oriented local newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. People are tired of crime-heavy news and seek positive, curated information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

### Newsletter Content Example
*   **"Things to Do This Weekend"**: Send out a Thursday morning newsletter highlighting local events, live music, food, and fun activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.
*   **Sourcing**: Find locally sourced events not found on Eventbrite (e.g., from chalkboards at cafes) to provide unique value, as AI can easily replicate standard listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

### [[newsletter_growth_strategies_and_lead_generation | Subscriber Acquisition]]
*   **Facebook Ads**: Use classic Facebook ads targeting local residents with straightforward content (e.g., "Five Restaurants to Try This Weekend in Miami"), linking to a landing page for subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. It's possible to acquire subscribers for less than 50 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>.

### [[monetization_through_newsletters | Monetization]] Strategies
*   **Local Sponsorships**: Monetize through local sponsorships, especially from high Lifetime Value (LTV) businesses like lawyers, realtors, and wealth managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
*   **Scaling**: A local newsletter can grow to a six-figure business in one city and scale to seven figures by expanding into multiple cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. Examples like Naptown Scoop (Annapolis, MD) generate $400k/year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. Larger examples include 6AM City ($8M revenue, 1.4M subscribers) and The Charlotte Agenda (acquired by Axios for $5M) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.
*   **Key Insight**: Keep it positive, community-oriented, and curated to differentiate from AI-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.

## Conclusion
Newsletter businesses in 2025 remain highly relevant and offer a low-cost, foundational approach to [[building_an_emailbased_business_with_newsletters | building an email-based business with newsletters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. They can support an agency, software, or marketplace business by consistently generating subscribers through paid ads and organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.

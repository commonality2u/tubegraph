This article provides a tutorial on how to acquire customers for a startup without relying on a large social media following or significant ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It focuses on simple, actionable tips for overcoming the "cold start problem" of finding an audience and generating leads from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

The strategies discussed are beneficial for entrepreneurs who don't use social media, haven't run ads, or are not inclined to post regularly on platforms like X or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Customer Acquisition

### 1. [[the_dream_100_method_for_customer_acquisition | The Dream 100 Method]]

The [[the_dream_100_method_for_customer_acquisition | Dream 100 method]] involves identifying and engaging with people or organizations who already have access to your target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

[!NOTE]
This strategy can generate more leads and traffic than all other marketing efforts combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

**How to Implement:**

1.  **Create a List:** Make a spreadsheet (Excel or Google Sheet) and list individuals or organizations that are already communicating with your desired audience or where your audience gathers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Example (Web Design Agency for Founders):**
        *   Podcast hosts who interview founders (e.g., Greg Eisenberg from *Startup Ideas Podcast*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.
        *   Platforms like Product Hunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
        *   Local entrepreneur meetups or organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
2.  **Research and Understand:** Fill out the spreadsheet with their main website, social media links, and audience size to get a feel for the person or organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. This research alone can provide many ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
3.  **Offer Value or Partnership:** Determine what you can offer that would expose you to their audience while providing significant value to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
    *   **Paid Collaboration:** Pay for an ad on their platform (e.g., Daring Fireball blog) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Content Contribution:** Pitch an idea for you to be an occasional host on their podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Direct Collaboration:** Propose a collaboration, even if you have nothing but a budget to offer (e.g., a collab with Chris Doe, a large Design Channel creator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Thoughtful Gifting:** Offer a highly personalized and meaningful gift to your top "dream 100" target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This stacks the cards in your favor and makes you memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
        *   Examples: A $50,000 signed guitar for a mentor's top target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, a Ferrari waiting in Hawaii for a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, a $80 Teenage Engineering device for a music-loving partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, or a $5 mini Buddha as a memorable token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
4.  **Master the Outreach (Canvas Strategy):** Don't just ask for a favor. Use the "Canvas Strategy" (as written by Ryan Holiday) to be helpful to busy gatekeepers or influential people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Put effort into your pitch, making it clear why engaging with you would be worth their while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

[!TIP]
This strategy works best if you are genuinely good at what you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

### 2. Engage in Groups and Communities

Identify where your target audience spends their time online and actively participate by delivering extreme levels of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

**Where to Engage:**

*   Paid communities (e.g., Startup Empire) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>
*   Free groups on Discord, School, Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>
*   Reddit groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>
*   YouTube comment sections of channels dedicated to your niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>
*   Quora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>

**How to Engage:**

*   **Be a Valuable Contributor:** Spend time being the most valuable person in the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Zero Spam:** Avoid directly asking for work or promoting yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **Provide Solutions:** Answer questions thoroughly, post free templates, and offer detailed, high-quality answers (e.g., on Quora) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Observe Challenges:** Pay attention to the problems people are discussing to understand their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **Engage with Creators:** Turn on notifications for relevant creators in your niche and be among the first to leave thoughtful, value-adding comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This builds trust with the creator and attracts other commenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Sharing their content also shows genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

This approach can generate leads for free or at a very low cost, leading to momentum within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

### 3. Create High-Value, Low-Quality Content

Even without a personal brand, you can create valuable content that attracts clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

[!NOTE]
"Low quality is the new high quality" in terms of production, but "low quality, high effort" is the key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

**How to Create This Content:**

*   **Focus on Tutorials:** Produce extremely valuable, long-form tutorials that show people how to do things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Example:** A 5-hour video demonstrating how to build a fully responsive landing page in Framer from scratch, with no cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
*   **Give Away Courses:** Instead of selling a course, offer the entire course for free on platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. The goal is to make people feel "guilty for consuming it" due to its immense value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
*   **Source Ideas from Questions:** Look for frequently asked questions in communities like Reddit, Quora, or specific groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Create videos directly addressing these questions.
*   **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Demonstrate your expertise by performing the task on video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. This often leads viewers to realize they'd rather hire you than do it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Value Over Polish:** The content doesn't need to look highly produced or have fancy slides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. Many people consume long-form videos passively for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

These two core strategies – [[the_dream_100_method_for_customer_acquisition | Dream 100]] and engaging in communities – can provide 80% of your initial clients within the first few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Adding content creation multiplies these efforts for even greater [[building_an_audience_for_faceless_content | leverage]] and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

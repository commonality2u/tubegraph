Building and launching AI apps for organic growth involves a strategic approach to product development, market identification, and marketing. Success often hinges on understanding trending ideas and implementing effective growth strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Finding App Ideas

There are two primary approaches to finding ideas for [[building_apps_with_ai_tools | building AI apps]]:

### Creating Completely New AI Ideas

One approach is to develop a completely new, unique idea that utilizes AI capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

*   **Verse App** The Verse app transforms a Spotify playlist into a visual "vision board" or "wall" with beautiful covers [00:01:24]. It's notable for its unique concept and went viral on TikTok, reaching the top 8 in the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Its marketing flow was embedded within the app's concept, encouraging users to share their creations via iMessage or TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This demonstrates the importance of considering the marketing funnel from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Adding AI to Existing Popular Apps

A more accessible method is to identify existing popular apps and integrate an "AI sizzle" to capture existing demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This approach is generally easier to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

*   **Umax (AI Calorie Tracking App)**: Developed by a 17-year-old who taught himself to code with ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, Umax is an AI calorie tracking app. Despite initial skepticism due to existing competition like MyFitnessPal, the app has achieved significant success, generating approximately $400,000 in monthly revenue and 200,000 downloads per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. Its design is simple, focusing on the core feature and payment flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **PictureThis (Plant Identifier App)**: This app, making $7 million in monthly revenue, is a prime example of an existing concept made more valuable with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. Before AI, plant identifiers were digital reference books, but the addition of AI (e.g., GPT, Anthropic) made the product work more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.
*   **Niche-Down Strategy**: Take a proven app idea and niche it down for a specific audience or country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>.
    *   Dating apps for specific demographics (e.g., Latinos, gay people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.
    *   Bible chat app leading to a "Bible for Women" app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.
    *   A weight loss app specifically for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.

### Identifying Trends

Staying ahead of trends is crucial for identifying profitable app ideas.

*   **App Store Search (ASO)**: Find keywords in the App Store that have sufficient search volume but low competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
    *   Example: A "text-to-speech" app gained quick organic growth because there were no strong mobile app competitors despite web alternatives like 11 Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
    *   Remone Holding: This company excels at identifying niche keywords like "fan noise," "green noise," or "anime girlfriend AI" to create apps that rank well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. They often repeat the same technological approach with different keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
    *   Tools like App Figures can help identify new keyword opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.
*   **External Trend Monitoring**: Look for trends outside the App Store on platforms like Google Trends, Ahrefs, Glimpse, Reddit, or TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
    *   Umax's idea came from the "looksmaxing" trend on Reddit and TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
    *   The Suno AI product, which creates AI songs from text, inspired numerous apps replicating its functionality using APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.
*   **Automation**: Set up automations to be notified when new apps rank in the top of the App Store in various categories, indicating emerging opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

## Organic Growth Strategies

Once an app is developed, various strategies can drive organic growth.

### 1. Product-Led Growth and Virality

Embed marketing into the app's core concept, encouraging users to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

*   **Verse App**: As mentioned, its design naturally encourages sharing of vision boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Islands (Discord for College Students)**: Required 5% of a school to pre-sign up before launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Users were then prompted to invite friends to ensure a secure and fun environment, with an average of 2.7 invitations per user, rapidly increasing initial sign-ups from 5% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This viral loop acts as a multiplier for marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **AI-Assisted Virality**: AI can enable highly targeted ads (e.g., specific high schools) to get initial users, kickstarting viral growth that would otherwise be difficult to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### 2. App Store Optimization (ASO)

ASO is the practice of ranking highly for relevant keywords in the App Store, similar to SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

*   **Keyword Optimization**: Place target keywords in the app's title and description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Conversion Rate**: Optimize the app store page to encourage downloads, signaling to Apple that the app is relevant and good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.
*   **Reviews and Growth Rate**: Higher numbers of reviews and a strong growth rate positively impact ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   **Launch Boost**: The first day of an app's launch is critical as Apple provides an initial boost; a high conversion rate during this period can lead to a positive flywheel of downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   **Paid Ads for ASO**: Running ads, even if not immediately profitable, can generate more traffic and reviews, indirectly boosting ASO rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

### 3. TikTok/Instagram Organic Marketing

Leverage short-video platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts to gain free traffic through organic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

*   **Native Content**: Create videos that feel organic to the platform, resembling regular content rather than ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
*   **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate the app into the video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
*   **Repeatable Formula**: Find a repeatable way to create content that consistently drives peaks in downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.
*   **Micro-Influencers**: Engage small creators or micro-influencers to promote the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. The algorithm favors good content, even from accounts with few followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.
*   **Conversion**: Viewers often search for the app name directly in the App Store based on the video content, even without a direct link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Iterative Approach**: Organic marketing is like a lottery; invest in many creators or content pieces, and the ones that go viral can be replicated and scaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>. The founder of Parallel Live, for example, creates his own viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Marketing (Paid Ads)

While the focus is organic, AI significantly enhances paid ad strategies, which can complement organic growth.

*   **High-Volume Ad Creation**: AI allows for the creation of hundreds, if not thousands, of ad variations to find winning formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness**: What was once extremely costly is now much more affordable with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.
*   **Example (PictureThis Ads)**: The plant identifier app tested 30,000 video creatives, an enormous number, to optimize for profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
*   **Automated Ad Production**: Tools like Arcads allow users to write a script, select AI-generated actors from a library, and quickly produce videos that match the script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. This enables testing 20 different ad angles in an hour, adding screenshots or removing backgrounds with one click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>.
*   **Localization**: AI tools can localize ads into different languages, allowing companies to scale successful campaigns to new countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. Starting in the US market is often recommended due to higher conversion rates for subscription apps, then expanding internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

By combining innovative ideas with data-driven organic and AI-assisted marketing strategies, app developers can achieve significant growth and profitability.

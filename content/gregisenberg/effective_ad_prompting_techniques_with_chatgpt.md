Creating winning advertisements with AI, specifically using [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | AI tools like Midjourney and Chat GPT]] like ChatGPT 4o, can significantly increase your Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and lead to a more profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. [[using_chatgpt_4o_to_create_inexpensive_ads | ChatGPT 4o]], a new image model, is gaining significant attention for its capabilities in generating visual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Jacob Posel, an expert in creating winning ads, memes, and visual content with ChatGPT 4o, demonstrates how to create ad account-ready ads in about two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## ChatGPT 4o for Ad Creation

Compared to other image generation tools like Midjourney or Ideogram, ChatGPT 4o is a multimodal language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This means prompting is less critical, as it has a better understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The most crucial elements for creating effective ads are the inspiration images and product images you provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Key Techniques for Ad Creation

### 1. Using Reference/Inspiration Ads

One highly effective method is to provide an inspiration ad that you want to adjust or use, along with your own custom product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

*   **Prompt Example**: "Add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   **Benefit**: This approach allows for the creation of super consistent and reliable ads by simply making edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Scaling**: You can easily generate variations by changing the people in the ad (men, women, old, young, different colors) to see what converts best for different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. When the API becomes generally available, this process will be trivial, allowing for hundreds of ads in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This enables experimentation at scale, which is crucial for optimizing ad performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### 2. Creating Ads Without Reference Images

If you are promoting a well-known concept, idea, or brand (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge Wallets), ChatGPT 4o has a strong understanding of these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. You can directly prompt it, and it will understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

However, for your own relatively new or small product without significant online presence (millions in ad spend monthly), always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

*   **Keywords for Realism**: Use "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to ensure photorealistic images, preventing cartoonish or odd-colored defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Detailed Description**: Provide a strong, detailed prose description of your desired image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Styling**: You can specify font types (e.g., Exo2 bold italic), color styles, and aspect ratios within the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### 3. Remixing Existing Ads for New Products

You can take an existing ad from one company and re-purpose its style and layout for a different product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

*   **Process**: Provide an original reference ad and your product imagery.
*   **Prompt Example**: "Recreate this ad for [new product]. Adjust the background to better fit [new product] Style. Change the price to [$XX now]. Generate the image." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>
    *   Adding "generate the image" helps ensure image output instead of text generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Ethical Note**: While this might feel "dirty," the speaker notes that companies already widely use inspiration ads, templates, and recreated designs from various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. AI merely makes this process more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

### 4. Changing the Concept of an Existing Ad

This technique involves swapping out a product in an existing ad and changing its theme, for example, from a Black Friday ad to a Christmas-themed one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

*   **Prompt**: Very simple prompts can achieve this when combined with strong reference images, as "a picture is worth a thousand words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   **Strategic Application**: This enables targeting major holidays (Christmas, New Year's, Valentine's Day) or even niche, funny ones (National Hot Dog Day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   **Real-time Marketing**: Companies can now leverage short-lived news cycle moments with timely, clever, and funny ads, which was previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. AI can be set up to monitor news feeds (like Twitter) and mass-produce such ads instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## Sourcing Ad Inspiration

*   **Meta Ad Library**: While not directly searchable for inspiration, tools like Creative OS, ForPlay, and icon.me read, tag, and make the Meta Ad Library searchable for inspiration and templating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **Sora Explore Page**: The Sora explore page (using the same underlying model as ChatGPT but with potentially less strict policy guidelines and better photorealism) is an excellent resource for ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. You can see how others are prompting, and clicking on any image reveals its prompt, which can then be remixed or adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. This helps in discovering unique aesthetics and shortening the time to value for ad creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## Prompting Best Practices

*   **Clarity and Directness**: Be very clear and direct in what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **New Chat for Adjustments**: If your initial prompt doesn't yield the desired result, start a *new chat* instead of continuing in the same conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Continuing in the same thread often leads to worse results because the AI uses its previously generated, potentially flawed image as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. A new chat with adjustments will produce similar, improved images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Specify Language**: Explicitly prompt it to write in English to avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Control Output**: To ensure image generation over text, include "generate the image" in your prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratio**: ChatGPT 4o usually defaults to 9x16, but you can specify desired aspect ratios like 1x1 or 9x16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

By applying these techniques, businesses can leverage [[sequential_prompting_with_ai_tools | AI tools]] to rapidly generate diverse and compelling ad creatives, allowing for extensive experimentation and [[optimizing_ad_performance_with_ai | optimizing ad performance with AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.# Effective Ad Prompting Techniques with ChatGPT

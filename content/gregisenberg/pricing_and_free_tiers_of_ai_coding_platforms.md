This article discusses the [[cost_and_subscription_plans_of_ai_services | pricing and free tiers of AI coding platforms]], offering insights into common structures and recommendations for users.

## General Pricing Structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>

Many AI coding tools share a similar base pricing structure. The initial tier typically ranges from $20 to $40 USD per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Beyond this starter amount, prices can escalate to $50, $130, and even higher for more advanced tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

Specific examples of base pricing include:
*   **Lovable:** $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>
*   **Bolt:** $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>
*   **Tempo:** $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>
*   **Replit:** Within the $20 to $40 range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>

## Leveraging Free Tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>

A significant advantage of most AI coding platforms is their "great" and "rich" free tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. These free tiers often come with daily or weekly caps on usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

It is highly recommended to utilize these free tiers extensively to explore and test different tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. This allows users to determine which tool best fits their needs before committing to a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The speaker personally used every free tier available, even tracking when tools would reach their token limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

> "I don't want anyone to just pay for something uh just because I said it's good use the free tier come with your own conclusions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>

Users are encouraged to build a simple application, such as a to-do list, using the free tier of each tool to evaluate their experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. This practical approach helps in understanding the control offered, the AI's assumptions, and the overall usability of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

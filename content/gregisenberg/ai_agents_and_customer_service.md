[[ai_agents_in_marketing | AI agents]] represent a significant opportunity for businesses, particularly in areas like customer service and lead management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. They are essentially voice large language models (LLMs) capable of handling complex interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Capabilities and Use Cases
[[use_cases_for_ai_agents_in_business_operations | AI agents]] can perform a variety of tasks that traditionally require human interaction:
*   **Lead Handling** They can take initial calls with leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   **Scheduling and Rescheduling** [[ai_receptionists_as_a_solution_for_business_operations | AI agents]] can set up appointments and manage rescheduling requests, even when attempts are made to "throw them off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Customer Conversion** Eventually, these agents may be able to close sales with customers directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Customer Support** They can handle millions of customer chats efficiently, leading to significantly faster response times (80-90% faster) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **SAS and Support Calls** [[automation_in_sales_and_customer_interactions | AI agents]] are particularly useful for Software as a Service (SaaS) companies or for helping customers by setting up follow-up phone calls with human account executives (AEs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Business Impact and Opportunities
The adoption of [[benefits_of_ai_agents_over_human_employees | AI agents]] can lead to substantial financial gains. A recent report from Clara indicated they expect to add $40 million in profit by deploying 700 new [[automation_and_ai_in_customer_support | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

For businesses, especially those with large customer service teams, there's a significant opportunity to:
*   **Cost Savings** Propose saving companies millions per month by implementing [[automation_and_ai_in_customer_support | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. A model could involve taking a percentage of these cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Value Generation** Alternatively, focus on generating new value (e.g., more customers) rather than just saving money, which can capture significantly higher returns (four to eight times more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Models** To de-risk the entrepreneur, a starting model could involve a base cost plus a percentage of cost savings, eventually transitioning to a value-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **[[building_businesses_around_ai_agents | AI transformation agencies]]** The demand for [[using_ai_for_competitive_analysis_and_customer_support | AI transformation]] services is growing, similar to past digital transformation trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

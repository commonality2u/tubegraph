This article reviews and compares two prominent [[using_ai_tools_for_design | AI product designer]] tools, Poly.ai and V0 (from Vercel), based on a live demonstration and user experience. The goal was to test their ability to generate production-ready designs and front-end code from natural language prompts, and to evaluate their effectiveness for startup product design. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>

## Poly.ai Review

Poly.ai is an [[using_ai_tools_for_design | AI product designer]] YC startup that claims to produce "beautiful designs" and "production ready code" from simple English prompts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>

### Initial Impressions & Features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

Upon first use, Poly.ai presents an interface similar to ChatGPT but tailored for design. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> Key features noted include:
*   **Text-to-Design Input**: Users can write what they want to build. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
*   **Microphone Input**: A convenient feature for voice-to-text prompting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
*   **Image Upload**: Allows users to upload a wireframe or an image for design inspiration. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> This feature is considered "huge" as it enables drawing a wireframe on a napkin and uploading it for the AI to interpret. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
*   **Customization Options**: Includes settings for light/dark mode, font, radius, and colors, which can be adjusted post-generation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>
*   **Credit System**: The free tier offers 250 credits, with pages costing 50 credits and components 25 credits. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>

### First Design Attempt: YouTube Analytics Tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>

A hypothetical multi-million dollar startup idea for a YouTube engagement prediction tool was used as the prompt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> The tool would predict how changes to video titles, thumbnails, and other elements affect engagement. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> An image of an existing X (formerly Twitter) analytics tool was provided as inspiration. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> The design request included terms like "glassy," "minimalist," and "colorful calls to action." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>

#### Results of First Prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
*   The AI named the product "Predict," generating a landing page with copy like "AI powered analytics to optimize your YouTube content and maximize your engagement." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>
*   The design did not appear "glassy" as requested. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>
*   Crucially, the "Get Started" and "See Demo" buttons on the generated landing page were non-functional, only resulting in a black screen. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
*   The tool generated only a landing page, not the actual product interface with analytics or interactive elements, which was a significant disappointment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>

### Challenges and Insights from First Attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>

*   **Lack of Product Output**: The main issue was the generation of a static landing page instead of a clickable, explorable product interface. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>
*   **Non-functional Elements**: Buttons that didn't lead anywhere. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
*   **No Progress Bar**: The generation process took a few minutes without any visual progress indicator, leading to uncertainty. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>
*   **[[designing_with_ai_prompt_clarity | Prompt Clarity]]**: The experience highlighted the necessity of knowing specific design terms. The user had to look up "glassy" to find the correct term: "glassmorphism." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>

> "The reality is you need with all these a lot of these tools it's as good as the prompt that you can do it right so you do need to know design terms and like what's trending and what people call Taste to get the most out of it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>

### Second Design Attempt: Emphasizing "Glassmorphism" and Product Views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>

The user refined the prompt, explicitly requesting "glassmorphism" and expressing disappointment with the previous "irrelevant" website analytics dashboards that were generated instead of YouTube-specific product views. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>

#### Results of Second Prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>
*   The design improved, becoming more "glassy," though not fully embodying the desired aesthetic. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>
*   Crucially, Poly.ai now generated actual product screens for the YouTube analytics tool, including:
    *   AB testing views for title, description, and thumbnail. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>
    *   Cumulative engagement charts with interactive hover states (a feature noted as superior to V0). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>
    *   Statistical confidence metrics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>
    *   AI suggestions for optimization. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>
*   The tool also generated the underlying code, which is a significant advantage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>

## V0 (Vercel) Review

V0 by Vercel is another well-known [[using_ai_tools_for_design | AI product designer]] in the space. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

### Comparison with Poly.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>

The same prompt and inspirational image used for Poly.ai's first attempt were given to V0 for comparison. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>

#### Key Differences and Advantages of V0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>
*   **Communicative Feedback**: V0 provides ongoing feedback on its thought process during generation, making the experience less of a "black box" compared to Poly.ai. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>
*   **Perceived Speed**: While actual generation time might be similar, V0 feels faster due to its communicative nature. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>
*   **Interactive Design**: V0's generated designs often allow for clickable elements and interaction within the demo. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>
*   **Responsive to Feedback**: When questioned about the "glassmorphic" design, V0 responded that it would enhance the design to incorporate more pronounced blur effects and borders. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a> This direct feedback mechanism is a strong point for [[improving_ai_designs_and_interfaces | improving AI designs and interfaces]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>

#### Results from V0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>
*   V0 created a product interface that literally copied the provided image but built it out as an interactive product. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>
*   It included features like "Version A" and "Version B" for content, title, description, and thumbnail analysis, with "AI recommendations" for performance prediction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>
*   Visually, V0's designs were generally considered slightly nicer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>

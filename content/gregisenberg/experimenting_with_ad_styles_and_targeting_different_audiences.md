Using AI to create winning ads can significantly increase Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and potentially lead to a highly profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The key lies in mastering the skills to [[prompting_techniques_for_chatgpt_40_in_ad_creation | prompt ChatGPT 4o]], which is a new image model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Why Experimentation Matters
The ultimate goal in advertising is to [[creating_and_testing_product_demand_through_online_ads | create ads that convert]], which is largely a game of experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. AI tools enable experimentation at scale, allowing marketers to test various visual elements like character appearance (e.g., a woman looking left or right, with blonde or red hair) that can significantly impact ROAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. The ad itself can be considered the targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. This approach makes targeting more personal and entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>.

## [[aipowered_advertising_and_content_creation | AI-Powered Advertising]] with ChatGPT 4o

ChatGPT 4o is a multimodal language model, meaning prompting is less critical compared to pure image models like Midjourney or Ideogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. It has a strong understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Key Elements for Effective Ads
The most crucial elements for creating good ads are the inspiration images and product images provided to the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### When to Use Reference Images
AI models have a good understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge Wallets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. For such established brands, you can simply prompt it by name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. However, for a new, relatively small product or one without extensive online presence (millions in ad spend), always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Experimenting with Ad Styles and Audiences

### 1. Varying Audience and Characters
You can generate photorealistic images of different audiences or upload your own from photoshoots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. This allows for testing what converts for various demographics like men, women, old, young, and different ethnicities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. When the API becomes available, it will be trivial to generate hundreds of ads for different audiences in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### 2. Using Inspiration/Reference Ads
Take an existing ad as inspiration and provide your own product imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This allows for creating super consistent and reliable ads by making simple edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

*   **Example 1: Adjusting an existing ad**: A Jones Road Beauty ad was adjusted by adding a custom product image and text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. The AI intelligently understood the layout requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   **Example 2: Remixing ads for different products**: An ad for Rise was recreated for Athletic Greens (AG1) by adjusting the background style, changing the price, and generating the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. This practice is common in the industry, where companies use inspiration or templates to create ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.
*   **Example 3: Changing ad concepts/themes**: A Black Friday ad for a Ridge wallet was transformed into a Christmas-style ad by simply requesting the change and providing the new product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>.

### 3. Leveraging Current Events and News Cycles
Companies can now take advantage of short-term news cycle moments to create timely ads, which was previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. For instance, an ad for Rippling was created as an old Wall Street Journal-style newspaper ad, referencing a recent controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>. AI could potentially watch news feeds and Twitter to produce such ads en masse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.

### 4. Targeting Niche Holidays or Birthdays
Beyond major holidays (Christmas, New Year's), there's potential to target niche events like "National Hot Dog Day" or even individual birthdays with personalized offers (e.g., "Happy Birthday, 30% off Ridge wallet") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>.

## [[prompting_techniques_for_chatgpt_40_in_ad_creation | Prompting Techniques]] for Ad Creation

*   **Keywords for Photo Realism**: Use "ultra-realistic" or "photo-realistic" to ensure images don't default to cartoonish or weird colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.
*   **Detailed Prose Descriptions**: Provide a strong, detailed prose description of your desired image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.
*   **Font and Style Control**: Specify font types (e.g., Exo2 bold italic), color styles, and aspect ratios. For well-known fonts, the AI has a decent understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Text Generation**: To ensure the output is consistently an image, specifically add "generate the image" to your prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>.
*   **Sora Explore Page for Inspiration**: Sora (which uses the same underlying model) has an "explore page" where users can see images and their corresponding prompts. This is an excellent resource for understanding how effective prompts work and for ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. You can click on any image to see its prompt and even remix or edit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
*   **Start a New Chat for Adjustments**: If the initial prompt doesn't yield the desired result, start a new chat for adjustments instead of continuing the same conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. This prevents the AI from using its own generated (potentially flawed) image as a reference, which can lead to worse results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>. New chats maintain consistency while allowing for improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Directness**: Be very clear and direct in what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.
*   **Balancing Vagueness and Specificity**: For well-known products or strict instructions, AI can often get it right on the first try <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:00">[31:10:00]</a>. For less well-known companies or when exploring creativity, initial prompts may be vague, relying on the AI's creativity, and may require 2-3 iterations to refine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>. Once an initial idea is generated, more specific prompts can guide it towards the exact desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:04:00">[41:04:00]</a>.
*   **Language Specification**: Prompt specifically to write in English to avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>.
*   **Expected Consistency**: ChatGPT's "temperature" (randomness of output) is quite low. Giving the same prompt generally results in a similar response, making iterative refinement predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>.
*   **Image Dimensions**: ChatGPT usually defaults to a 9:16 aspect ratio, but you can specify other dimensions like 1:1 or 9:16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:54:00">[37:54:00]</a>.

### Finding Ad Inspiration
Resources like Creative OS, Forplay, and Icon.me read in data from Meta's Ad Library, tag it, and make it easily searchable for ad inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>.

This era presents an incredible opportunity to [[creating_ads_using_chatgpt_40 | create memes]] and ads that truly stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>.

[[ChatGPT 4o]] is an advanced image model capable of creating winning ads, memes, and visual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Leveraging this tool can significantly increase your return on ad spend (ROAS) and contribute to a profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The process of generating effective ads with [[ChatGPT 4o]] can be as quick as two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Core Principles for Ad Creation with ChatGPT 4o

Unlike other [[AI Tools like Midjourney and Chat GPT]] (like Midjourney or Ideogram), [[ChatGPT 4o]] is a multimodal language model, meaning prompting is less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It has a better understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The most important elements for creating good ads are:
*   **Inspiration Images** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>: Ads you want to adjust or use as a style guide.
*   **Product Images** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>: Your own custom imagery for the product.

### When to Use Reference Images

Models like [[ChatGPT 4o]] have a strong understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge wallets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For such established brands, you can simply prompt it without a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. However, for a new or smaller product with limited online presence, always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Practical Ad Creation Techniques

Here are several effective ways to create ads using [[ChatGPT 4o]]:

### 1. Adjusting Existing Ads with New Imagery

This method involves taking an existing ad and seamlessly integrating your product and desired audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

*   **Process**:
    1.  Provide an inspiration ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    2.  Provide your custom product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
    3.  Use a basic prompt, such as: "Add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: Creates super consistent and reliable ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It allows for experimenting with different audiences (men, female, old, young, diverse colors) at scale to see what converts best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This means rapidly testing different ad variations that could significantly impact ROAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### 2. Creating Ads Without Reference Images (for Well-Known Concepts)

For widely recognized brands or themes, detailed text prompts can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

*   **Key Prompting Elements**:
    *   Use "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" keywords to achieve photo-realistic images and avoid cartoonish defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
    *   Provide a strong, detailed prose description of your desired image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
    *   Specify font types (e.g., "font type exo2 bold italic") for well-known fonts, as the model understands their representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
    *   Experiment with color styles and aspect ratios directly in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Inspiration**: The [[Sora]] explore page is an excellent resource for understanding how the best prompts work and for ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Clicking on any image on their explore page reveals the prompt used to create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. [[Sora]] is also noted for less strict policy guidelines and better photo realism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### 3. Remixing Concepts and Styles

This involves taking an existing ad's layout and content, and re-purposing it for a different product or brand.

*   **Process**:
    1.  Provide an original reference ad and your product imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
    2.  Give clear instructions for adjustments, such as: "Recreate this ad for [new product]. Adjust the background to better fit [brand] Style. Change the price to [$X] SL out to [$Y] now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
    3.  Crucially, add "generate the image" to the prompt to ensure it generates an image rather than text describing the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Ethical Note**: While this may feel "dirty" as it reuses concepts another company spent time and money developing, it's argued that this practice is common in the industry through inspiration ads and templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. [[ChatGPT 4o]] simply automates what was already happening manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### 4. Changing Ad Concepts for Holidays or Specific Moments

Adapt an existing ad's look and feel to a different theme, such as a holiday or current event.

*   **Process**:
    1.  Provide an existing ad (e.g., a Black Friday ad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
    2.  Swap out the product image if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
    3.  Instruct the model to change the style to a new theme, e.g., "swap it out and change it to a Christmas style ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: This technique is powerful because reference images significantly reduce the need for strict prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. It enables highly personalized and entertaining ads, taking advantage of major holidays (Christmas, New Year's) or even niche ones (National Hot Dog Day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. Businesses can also rapidly create ads leveraging breaking news or "new cycle moments" that were previously prohibitively expensive and slow to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

## Tips for Effective Prompting

*   **Be Clear and Direct**: When writing prompts, be very clear and direct about what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Start New Chats for Adjustments**: If your initial prompt doesn't yield the desired result, start a new chat rather than continuing in the same conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This prevents the model from using a flawed AI-generated image as its reference, which can lead to progressively worse results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. New chats maintain consistency while allowing for improvements based on the refined prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Specify Dimensions**: [[ChatGPT 4o]] typically defaults to a 9x16 aspect ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. You can specify desired dimensions like 1x1 or 9x16 in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

## Finding Ad Inspiration

To find inspiration for ads and effective prompts, consider these resources:
*   Creative OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>
*   ForPlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   Icon.me <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>
*   These tools often read from the Meta Ad Library, tagging and making ads searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
*   [[Sora]] Explore Page: Provides prompts used to generate images, useful for understanding effective prompting and ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### Live Example: Creating an Ad for LCA

To demonstrate, an ad was created for "LCA - Late Checkout Agency," a design agency for the AI age working with top companies like Dropbox and Salesforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

*   **Objective**: Create a digital ad that conveys a luxury, futuristic "SWAT team" vibe, similar to a Patek Philippe watch ad, rather than a newspaper theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
*   **Process**:
    1.  **Gathering Assets**: Screenshots were taken from LCA's website, including their logo, typography, bolding/italics, coloring, and client logos (Dropbox, Salesforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
    2.  **Inspiration**: A vintage Rolex ad with a pointing man was chosen for its color and "hey, do you need AI?" vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
    3.  **Initial Prompt**:
        ```
        "Generate a digital ad for LCA (Late Checkout Agency). LCA is a SWAT team design agency only for the most interesting brands on the planet helping them with building AI first tools. It only works with the best companies. I have provided some screenshots from their website for you to use as inspiration in the ad as well as a reference vintage Rolex ad as inspiration. Use this to capture the luxury vibe of the company. Generate the image."
        ```
        This prompt relied on the model's creativity due to vague instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
    4.  **First Result Analysis**: The ad featured a man with fire, a golf course background, and good typography for the LCA logo. However, it also included a Rolex watch, indicating the model interpreted "luxury" literally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. The copy was good: "Leaders at billion dollar Brands choose LCA to Define their future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.
    5.  **Refinement (New Chat)**: To remove the watch and replace it with client logos, a new chat was started to avoid degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.
        ```
        "Rather than generating a watch, show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images."
        ```
    6.  **Second Result Analysis**: The man no longer pointed, but gestured, and a Rolex watch was still visible on his wrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. However, the ad successfully included client logos (Dropbox, Salesforce), though it hallucinated Disney as a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. The overall vibe and digital style with a clear call to action (CTA) were achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.
*   **Key Learnings from Example**:
    *   Initial results may require iteration, usually 2-3 attempts for complex or new concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
    *   Models have a "temperature" (randomness) setting; similar prompts generally yield similar results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.
    *   Well-known company logos are more likely to be accurately reproduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.
    *   Specific instructions are needed to control image elements (e.g., "the man is pointing," "include all of these logos by name") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The API for [[ChatGPT 4o]] is expected to become generally available, making mass ad generation trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This will allow for generating hundreds of ads quickly by providing reference ads and different audience variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The future of advertising involves more personal, funny, and entertaining ads, driven by AI's ability to quickly implement creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

The landscape of design tools is rapidly evolving, prompting a re-evaluation of traditional design workflows, particularly the role of tools like [[introduction_to_figma_and_its_best_practices | Figma]] compared to code-based platforms like Framer. While [[introduction_to_figma_and_its_best_practices | Figma]] excels in certain areas, the future points towards a blurring of lines between design and code, potentially shifting [[introduction_to_figma_and_its_best_practices | Figma]]'s primary function earlier in the design process.

## The Role of [[introduction_to_figma_and_its_best_practices | Figma]] in Design Exploration
[[introduction_to_figma_and_its_best_practices | Figma]] remains a powerful tool for initial design exploration and ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is highly effective for:
*   **Generative Design**: Quickly getting many ideas out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: Exploring more divergent ideas and iterating quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.
*   **Pushing Visual Ideas**: Enabling designers to push boundaries and figure out what they want to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>.
*   **Sketching and Early Stages**: Considered akin to using a pencil to sketch out ideas on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>.
*   **Current Best Starting Point**: It's still considered the best place to start a design project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.

## Limitations of AI-Generated Designs
Tools utilizing AI, such as [[aigenerated_designs_and_productionready_code | V0]], while efficient, can lead to designs that feel "tame" or "slightly templated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. This contrasts with [[introduction_to_figma_and_its_best_practices | Figma]]'s capacity for pushing truly unique visual concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>.

## The Shift Towards Code-Based Tools
The design process for web design has evolved, with a growing trend towards incorporating code-based tools earlier in the workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.
*   **Framer's Role**: After exploring a wide array of ideas in [[introduction_to_figma_and_its_best_practices | Figma]], designers are increasingly moving to Framer to build and refine the final 5-10% of a design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. Subsequent pages or sections of a website might even be built directly in Framer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>.
*   **Code-Based Building**: There's a growing belief that the more ideas are built in code-based tools, the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.
*   **Analogy**: If [[introduction_to_figma_and_its_best_practices | Figma]] is a pencil and paper for sketching, a code-based tool like Framer or a tool like [[aigenerated_designs_and_productionready_code | V0]] is more like a word processor, producing more "templatized, productized stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.

## The Blurring Future of Design and Code
The industry is "staring The Next Step change in software creation in the face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.
*   **High-Fidelity Convergence**: The current separation between high-fidelity UI in [[introduction_to_figma_and_its_best_practices | Figma]] and matching high-fidelity code is expected to blur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.
*   **[[introduction_to_figma_and_its_best_practices | Figma]]'s Evolving Place**: Once this line blurs, [[introduction_to_figma_and_its_best_practices | Figma]] might find a more prominent place earlier in the process, serving as a lower-fidelity tool for exploring ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.
*   **AI Integration**: AI tools like [[aigenerated_designs_and_productionready_code | V0]], or even [[introduction_to_figma_and_its_best_practices | Figma]] itself, may start to "dabble in this product space a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.
*   **Unsustainable Separation**: The long-term existence of high-fidelity design and high-fidelity code as separate entities is not considered sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.

The best way to learn and adapt to these changes is to "get in there, get your hands dirty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a> and actively experiment with the tools available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>.

The journey of creating software, particularly with modern AI tools, tends to divide individuals into two distinct groups: those with "high agency" and those with "low agency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. This distinction determines whether someone successfully develops a functional application or gets stuck and gives up early in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.

## High Agency in Software Development

Individuals with high agency are characterized by their persistence and proactive problem-solving approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. When faced with challenges in software creation, they embrace the idea that they are "in charge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

Key characteristics of high agency include:
*   **Self-Reliance with AI**: Instead of seeking guidance from influencers or teachers, high-agency individuals directly engage with AI tools like Claude or Cursor. They ask the AI questions, prompt it to fix errors, and understand that the AI might not provide the correct answer on the first try <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Persistence Through Errors**: Software development, especially when integrating [[benefits_and_challenges_of_integrating_ai_in_software_development | AI features]] or working with databases, is fraught with errors and bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. High-agency individuals possess the "grit to push through the errors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. They understand that by the second or third attempt, they can "will their way to a working app" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.
*   **Continuous Problem-Solving**: The process of learning and iterating on AI-generated code enhances problem-solving skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Even when facing a "blank screen" instead of helpful error messages, a high-agency approach involves actively requesting error logs from the AI to diagnose issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.
*   **Adaptability and Learning**: High-agency individuals are not afraid to enter "new territory," even if they are out of their element, such as when starting with a new framework like Next.js <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. They learn by doing and iterating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.

> "Once you get the aha moment where you're like oh this works and you realize that like you're in charge you don't need to ask anyone like influencer you don't need an influencer or a teacher you just need to ask AI... it might not give you the right answer on the first try but odds are by the second or third try like you will will your way to a working app." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>

## Low Agency in Software Development

In contrast, individuals with low agency tend to get "stuck on the first few steps and gave up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>. This often stems from an expectation of instant success, perhaps influenced by "highlight reels" seen on social media that don't show the underlying struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

## Cultivating High Agency

*   **Embrace the Process**: Understanding that coding, even with AI, involves "plumbing" (setting up libraries, organizing files) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a> and debugging is crucial. It's about "composing code" by guiding the AI with English prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Learn from Mistakes**: The speaker intentionally showcases errors during the demonstration, emphasizing that "mistakes are happening right now because the whole point of this video is for people to learn how you approach problems too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Error messages, though frustrating, are vital for diagnosing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.
*   **Utilize Available Tools**: Tools like v0 for front-end design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, Cursor for coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>, ReplIt for deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>, and Perplexity for finding documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a> significantly lower barriers to entry.
*   **Strategic Prompting**: Being specific with AI prompts, even giving it the "purpose" of a design, can enhance its creativity and accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. Providing screenshots and direct instructions for changes (e.g., "sip should be on the right, spit should be on the left") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a> helps the AI understand complex requests.
*   **Monetization**: Understanding concepts like using APIs for software and setting up payment integrations (e.g., Stripe) for [[productized_services_for_high_ltv_software | monetizing apps]] is also a crucial aspect of developing a project to its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>.

Ultimately, while [[benefits_and_challenges_of_integrating_ai_in_software_development | AI tools]] make software creation significantly easier and cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, it is the developer's agency—their willingness to learn, experiment, troubleshoot, and persist—that dictates success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. A strong sense of "taste" in design and understanding terminology also remain highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:5:02">[01:5:02]</a>.

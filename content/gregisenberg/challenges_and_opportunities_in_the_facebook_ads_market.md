There is a significant "empty space" in the market for non-traditional companies and solopreneurs to assist others with [[paid_advertising_insights | Facebook and Google Ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Many startups and businesses don't consider that even simple Google Ads are difficult to set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. Providing a basic package for Meta Ads and simple Google search ads can be a "game changer" for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

## Challenges in the Current Ad Market

Many small and large businesses need paid ads, or don't realize their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:40">[07:21:40]</a>. However, the existing market for paid ad services presents several challenges:
*   **Expensive and Confusing Agencies** Agencies are often too costly, large, and confusing for many businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:30">[07:30:30]</a>.
*   **"Douchy" Consultants** The market is also populated by individuals who might appear untrustworthy or intimidating, often characterized by a "gold Rolex" and a "get rich" facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:46">[07:35:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:23">[11:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:51">[12:38:51]</a>. This deters potential clients, especially in regions like Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:30">[10:13:30]</a>.
*   **Misconceptions about Ad Effectiveness** Many businesses believe that Facebook or Meta Ads "don't work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:27">[08:44:27]</a>. This often stems from encountering scammy individuals or ineffective agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:15">[12:22:15]</a>.
*   **Status Symbol of Not Running Ads** In "Ventureland," particularly among Silicon Valley startups, it can be seen as a "status symbol" to avoid running paid ads, implying organic growth is superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:39">[18:32:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:19">[18:54:19]</a>. This mindset, while relevant for cutting-edge tech, can be detrimental to small businesses like yoga retreats or creator events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:32">[19:07:32]</a>.
*   **Age Demographics** Meta Ads are "dead" for people under 35, but they work very well for people over 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:04">[15:57:04]</a>. Many entrepreneurs overlook this large demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:20">[16:07:20]</a>.

## Opportunities for Ad Consultancy

There is a significant opportunity for [[potential_for_ad_consultancy_serving_niche_markets | one-person ad consultants]] who can provide trustworthy, non-agency services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:14">[09:33:14]</a>.

### Niche Verticals
Consultants can specialize in specific niches that are underserved or wary of traditional agencies:
*   **Local Services** Hair salons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:54">[09:50:54]</a>.
*   **Female Product Owners** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:08">[09:57:08]</a>.
*   **Creative and Wellness Events** Growing Patreon accounts for creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:07">[11:42:07]</a>, yoga retreats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>, meditation, wellness, design, and art installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:23">[14:50:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:21">[15:01:21]</a>. Event owners often dislike selling and prefer to focus on putting on events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:02">[15:12:02]</a>.
*   **Revenue Share Model** Instead of a fixed fee, consultants can offer to take a percentage of ticket sales or revenue generated from ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:17">[13:46:17]</a>. This model can help get businesses "off the ground in one month" by aligning incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:14">[13:58:14]</a>.

### Approach and Service Delivery
*   **Advisory Model** Rather than traditional agency work, consultants can offer advisory services, literally sitting with clients, opening dashboards, and showing them how to run ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:49">[12:56:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:14">[13:04:14]</a>.
*   **Demystifying Ads** The goal is to demystify paid advertising for small businesses, making it accessible and understandable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:40">[12:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:59">[12:44:59]</a>.

## Implementing Paid Advertising Effectively

Paid ads, particularly on Meta and Google, can be a simple way for most people to start generating leads and monetizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:03">[19:49:03]</a>.

### Building a Sales Funnel
A key component of effective paid advertising is a well-structured [[building_a_sales_funnel_using_facebook_ads | sales funnel]].
*   **Funnel Hacking** A recommended learning method is to "funnel hack" successful funnels by signing up, screenshotting pages, and analyzing email sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:18:27">[28:18:27]</a>.
*   **VSL (Video Sales Letter) Funnel**
    *   **Opt-in Page:** The initial page offers something of value (e.g., a free training video or lead magnet like a PDF) to capture an email address and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:41:00">[29:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>. The ad itself "sells" the opt-in page, and the opt-in page "sells" watching the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:48:00">[30:48:00]</a>.
    *   **Video Training:** A free training video (e.g., one hour) that introduces the audience to the core topic, acting as a pitch or demonstration of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>.
    *   **Call Booking:** At the end of the training, instead of directly selling a product, offer a free call with a career coach to discuss more extensive training options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:20">[33:04:20]</a>.
*   **Example Funnel Metrics (June)**
    *   Ads Spent (Facebook & Google): $86,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:00]</a>
    *   Total Revenue Collected: $252,000 (clarified as $270,000 in later statement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:18:00">[35:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[35:20:00]</a>
    *   Return on Investment (ROI): 38% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>
    *   Call Bookings: 339 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>
    *   Turn-ups for Calls: 273 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:47:00">[35:47:00]</a>
    *   Units Sold (Workshop/Master Program): 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:54:00">[35:54:00]</a>
*   **Book Funnel** An alternative funnel involves offering a free or low-cost physical or digital book (e.g., "Workshop Playbook") as a lead magnet, collecting email addresses, and monetizing them later through email campaigns (e.g., Black Friday sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:04:00">[37:04:00]</a>.

### Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)
*   **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)** Focus on maximizing ROAS, aiming for $1.50 back for every $1 spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[26:21:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Tweaking** Constantly tweak every step of the funnel (e.g., landing pages, sales calls, videos, surveys) to increase conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>. A funnel from day one to day 100 usually looks quite different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:00">[27:29:00]</a>.
*   **Tools** Funnels are built using tools like Framer (for aesthetic appeal) or ClickFunnels (for ease of testing ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:00">[32:07:00]</a>. Email marketing is managed with platforms like ConvertKit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:58:00">[38:58:00]</a>.
*   **Attribution** While products like Hyros exist for detailed conversion tracking, it's often sufficient to focus on monthly profit & loss and Facebook ad spend ROI, assuming that good content builds trust and acts as a "shadow funnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:16:00">[41:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:15:00">[42:15:15]</a>.

### Importance of Copywriting
Copywriting (the text used in ads and landing pages) is crucial for conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:38:00">[43:38:00]</a>.
*   **Status Increase** Good copy should implicitly or explicitly suggest how the product or service will increase the customer's status (e.g., making them more valuable to colleagues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:32:00">[44:32:00]</a>.
*   **Pain vs. Pleasure** Copy can be written to:
    *   **Move away from pain:** Highlight how the product solves a painful problem or avoids negative situations (e.g., "never get stuck in the airport without your podcast equipment again") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:15:00">[46:15:00]</a>. This is often effective during difficult economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:05:00">[47:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Move towards pleasure:** Focus on the positive benefits and desirable outcomes (e.g., "how beautiful this thing is and how nice sounds") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:00">[46:51:00]</a>. This is often effective during prosperous times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:24:00">[47:24:00]</a>.

### Websites vs. Funnels
There is a clear distinction between websites and funnels:
*   A **website** is like a business card, simply stating what a business does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:42:00">[49:42:00]</a>.
*   A **funnel** is a step-by-step process designed to convert a stranger into a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:49:00">[49:49:00]</a>.

Knowing how to run ads or knowing someone who can demystify the process is invaluable for individuals and small teams who cannot afford massive branding campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>. It allows businesses to put money into a "machine" that finds people, then focus on converting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23:00">[25:23:00]</a>.

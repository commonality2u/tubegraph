Building a vertical SaaS business is described as a "science" rather than an art, focusing on specific industries to create tailored software solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This approach can lead to "enduring, strong retention" businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Why Vertical SaaS?

Vertical SaaS focuses on specific industries, optimizing processes, creating efficiencies, and generating cost or time savings, or revenue lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. While the concept isn't new, many founders shifted away from industry-specific software in the last 10-15 years to chase broader, multi-billion dollar "unicorn" opportunities, often leading to more failures than successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

The opportunity in vertical SaaS lies in its "boring" nature, which deters many from entering these markets, leaving ample room for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These businesses might not have the hyper-growth rates sought by venture capitalists, but they can be robust and profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## The Science of Vertical SaaS

The process of building a vertical SaaS business is described as a "mathematical scientific approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Step 1: Pick an Industry, Not an Idea

The initial step is to select an industry rather than starting with a software idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

#### Key Industry Characteristics
A good vertical SaaS opportunity typically has the following characteristics:
*   **Size**: A solid amount of operating revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. For venture-backed opportunities, bigger is better, but for bootstrapped ventures, the market doesn't need to be as large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Number of Companies**: A substantial number of companies within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Industries with very few companies (e.g., 2,500 in General Medical and Surgical Hospitals) are "enterprise-driven," which is difficult for new bootstrapped businesses due to the need for massive feature sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Segmentation**: A healthy mix of small businesses (doing a few million in revenue), mid-market businesses (e.g., $10-$100 million), and enterprise businesses (over $100 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Starting with small and mid-sized businesses is easier as they require less complex feature sets, allowing the product to grow and expand capabilities over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

#### Example: Machine Shops
Machine shops are identified as a prime industry for vertical SaaS because:
*   They generate $240 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   There are 22,000 businesses in the industry, with an average machine shop doing $2 million per year in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   The industry is "beautifully segmented," with a healthy mix of small, mid-market, and some enterprise players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   Domain expertise isn't a strict requirement to enter an industry; learning and deep dive research can suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Step 2: Understand the Business Operations
Visualize and map out the entire customer journey and end-to-end operations of businesses within the chosen industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This process helps identify where software opportunities exist and their potential scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. For example, Toast, a restaurant software company, visualized every aspect of a restaurant's operations in its S1 filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### Step 3: Analyze P&Ls and Identify Spend Areas
Gathering as many Profit & Loss statements from businesses in the industry as possible helps understand where companies spend money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Sources include publicly traded companies' P&Ls and industry-focused bankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Software should aim to:
*   Increase revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   Decrease costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   Prevent customer churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   Maintain compliance (for regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

Understanding P&Ls reveals existing expenses, how much is spent on people that could be automated, and existing software solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

### Step 4: Study the Competition
Investigate existing software solutions in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. Common scenarios include:
*   **Legacy Providers**: Old, comprehensive ERPs that handle most operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Fragmented Horizontal Solutions**: Businesses stitching together general-purpose software like CRMs, project management tools, or communication apps not specific to their industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. These present opportunities for an all-in-one vertical solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.
*   **Paper Processes**: Despite being 2024, many industries still rely on manual, paper-based workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

Instead of generic searches like "trade school software," examine each operational bucket identified in Step 2 to uncover specific pain points and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

#### [[using_ai_to_build_a_saas_startup | Leveraging AI for Research]]
AI tools like ChatGPT can be valuable research assistants for early-stage market analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. They excel at providing:
*   Market size and segmentation data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
*   End-to-end operational workflows for an industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   Prevalent software solutions and their categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.
*   Identifying areas still using pen and paper (e.g., job tracking, inventory, maintenance logs in machine shops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   Suggesting areas ripe for [[leveraging_ai_and_software_solutions_in_vertical_saas | AI adoption]] (e.g., predictive maintenance, optimized job scheduling, automated quality control, energy management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.
*   Highlighting processes where businesses use multiple horizontal solutions that could be consolidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

#### Validation is Key
While AI provides valuable desk research, it's crucial to validate findings through direct engagement with the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. This can involve visiting businesses, offering to buy lunch, and shadowing operations to confirm the reality on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. Prototyping ideas (e.g., with design tools or simple websites) and seeking feedback from potential customers is also essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.

## Go-to-Market Strategy
Before investing significant time, founders must understand and be comfortable with the go-to-market strategy for the chosen industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>. A great product without users is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

### Customer Acquisition Models
Many vertical industries have historically required heavy outside sales models, involving face-to-face interactions and relationship building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. This contrasts with "product-led" or "marketing-led" motions preferred by VCs for their speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. Sales-led motions often necessitate high average contract values (ACVs) to build large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>. For faster growth, seek industries where product-led or marketing-led acquisition is feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

### The Power of Media and Community
Consider if the target industry's professionals are active on social media or open to digital content. Building a media presence, such as a niche newsletter, can be an innovative [[marketing_strategies_for_saas_startups | marketing strategy]] to engage an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>. This approach can build advocacy and eventually serve as a channel to introduce software solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>.

## Wedge Products: The Entry Point
A "wedge product" is defined as a "get-in-the-door product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>. The goal for vertical SaaS is often to become the "all-in-one" solution, but no company starts there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.

### What is a Wedge Product?
A wedge product should:
*   Address an area that is currently handled poorly (e.g., on paper or with bad competition) but is crucial to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   Be easy to implement and deploy quickly (not a 12-month process) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
*   Serve as a "reputation prover," demonstrating value and building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. Most fail their wedge product if they don't think it through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.
*   Ideally, it should be a marketing-led acquisition tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.

### Roofer.com: A Case Study
Roofer.com, a software company for the roofing industry, offers a prime example of a successful wedge product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. Instead of starting with an all-in-one solution, they launched a free proposal tool using Google Maps data to provide real-time quotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

*   This tool allowed roofing companies to acquire customers digitally (via Instagram/Facebook ads), which was unheard of in the home services industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
*   It became a free, viral tool because it charged a percentage of bookings, not an upfront fee, making it zero-cost to the user until a sale was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.
*   Once trust was established, Roofer.com could then introduce other products, such as a CRM, and move towards an all-in-one solution, leveraging the fact that acquiring an existing customer is easier than a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.

### Owning the Transaction: Payments
If a wedge product can be built before or after the core transaction, it creates an opportunity to eventually own the transaction itself by integrating payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>. Integrating payments can dramatically increase the total addressable market and accelerate growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. For example, Toast's market size expanded from $120 million (software fees) to trillions by taking a percentage of restaurant transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

### Value-Based Pricing
When [[pricing_strategies_for_vertical_saas_products | pricing a vertical SaaS product]], a core approach is to understand the cost of the problem being solved for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.

*   **Quantify Value**: Focus on building products that clearly:
    *   Increase Revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>
    *   Decrease Costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>
    *   Prevent Customer Churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>
    *   Help with Compliance (for regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>
*   **ROI-driven Pricing**: Calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) your solution provides. For example, a retention tool for trade schools that saves students from dropping out can be priced based on the tuition revenue saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. If the tool saves five students paying $20,000 tuition each, that's $100,000 in saved revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.
*   **Share the Value**: Price your product at a portion of the value you deliver (e.g., starting at 50% of the ROI and adjusting based on market feedback) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>. This allows for clear justification to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.

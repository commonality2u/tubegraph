Vertical SaaS (Software as a Service) focuses on creating industry-specific software, which, while sometimes perceived as "boring," offers significant opportunities for businesses to achieve substantial revenue and build enduring companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This approach stands in contrast to the broader, more generalized software solutions that often chase massive, multi-billion dollar "unicorn" opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Luke Sfinos, a vertical SaaS advisor to Atomic and founder of a multi-million dollar vertical SaaS business, describes building vertical SaaS as more of a "science" than an "art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Why Vertical SaaS?

Historically, software was created to optimize businesses, increase efficiency, generate cost savings, or boost revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. However, in the last 10-15 years, many founders moved away from industry-specific software to chase broader markets, which, while creating huge winners, also resulted in many failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Vertical SaaS allows for the creation of enduring, strong businesses with good retention, even if they don't always have the explosive growth rates venture capitalists typically seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Luke Sfinos, for instance, built a successful vertical SaaS business in the trade school industry, which is considered a "boring" sector, demonstrating the vast opportunities available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## The Science of Building a Vertical SaaS Business

The process of building a vertical SaaS business involves a structured, scientific approach, starting with the industry, not an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### 1. Picking an Industry

The first step is to focus on an industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Key characteristics that make an industry a good opportunity for vertical SaaS include:
*   **Size**: How much revenue do companies in that industry generate? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>
*   **Number of Companies**: How many companies are in that industry? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>
*   **Segmentation**: Avoid "top-heavy" industries dominated by a few large enterprises, especially for bootstrapped ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Look for a healthy mix of small businesses (a couple million in revenue), mid-market businesses ($10-100 million in revenue), and enterprise businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   **Reasoning**: It's easier to enter the SMB market with a smaller feature set, then grow the product's capabilities to serve mid-market and enterprise clients later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

#### Example: Machine Shops
Machine shops are identified as a promising industry for vertical SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Revenue**: $240 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Number of Companies**: 22,000 businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Segmentation**: It's highly fragmented with a healthy amount of small and mid-market businesses, along with some enterprise players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. The average machine shop does $2 million in revenue per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

[!NOTE]
Domain expertise is helpful but not mandatory. Luke Sfinos had no prior experience in trade schools before building a successful business there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. It requires deep learning about the chosen industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### 2. Understanding Industry Operations

Once an industry is chosen, thoroughly map out the entire customer journey and operations of businesses within that industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. This process helps identify where software opportunities lie and their potential size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

#### Example: Toast S1 and Corsky
*   **Toast (restaurant software)**: Their S1 filing visualized every aspect of restaurant operations, from back office to kitchen, delivery, and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Corsky (trade school software)**: Operations include admissions, training (often hands-on in a garage setting), IT, student services, compliance, and job placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### 3. Analyzing P&Ls (Profit & Loss Statements)

Obtain and analyze as many P&Ls from businesses in the target industry as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Sources**: Publicly traded companies in the space, and industry-focused bankers who deal with buying and selling companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Understand where companies are spending money, how much is spent on human-led processes that could be automated by software, and what existing software solutions they are paying for and what they deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Software Goals**: Build software that:
    1.  Increases Revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>
    2.  Decreases Costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>
    3.  Prevents Customer Churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>
    4.  (In some industries) Maintains Compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>

### 4. Analyzing Competition

Before building, study existing software solutions in the market. Don't just Google "industry software"; look at each operational bucket within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

Common competitive landscapes:
*   **Legacy Providers**: Massive, often 30-year-old ERP systems that try to do everything A-Z <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Fragmented Horizontal Solutions**: Businesses stitching together general-purpose software (e.g., generic CRMs, Slack, Gmail, Zoho) not tailored to the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. These industries are "dying for an all-in-one" solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.
*   **Paper Processes**: Despite being 2024, many industries still rely on manual, paper-based processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. This represents a significant opportunity for digitization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## Using AI for Research

AI tools like ChatGPT can be valuable research assistants for vertical SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **Market Data**: Good for retrieving high-level data like market size and segmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
*   **Operational Workflows**: Can outline end-to-end operations (e.g., machine shop workflow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.
*   **Identifying Opportunities**: Can help identify areas with:
    *   **Paper Processes**: Where operations are still manual (e.g., job tracking, tooling/inventory, machine maintenance logs in machine shops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
    *   **Lack of AI Adoption**: Areas where AI could provide significant value (e.g., predictive maintenance, optimized job scheduling, automated quality control, energy management for machine shops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.
    *   **Fragmented Horizontal Solutions**: Where businesses use generic apps that aren't tailored to their industry (e.g., Trello, Asana, generic CRMs for project management in machine shops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

[!WARNING]
Always validate AI-generated insights by directly engaging with people in the target industry, for example, by offering to buy them lunch and shadowing their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

## [[Effective GotoMarket Strategy for Vertical SaaS | Go-to-Market Strategy]]

A strong go-to-market (GTM) strategy is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>. Founders should understand the distribution piece before investing significant time into product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

*   **Study Successful Companies**: Analyze the GTM strategies of successful vertical SaaS companies in the target space to understand how they acquired their first 10, 100, and 1,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
*   **Sales-Led vs. Product/Marketing-Led**: Many vertical industries have traditionally required heavy outside sales models, involving face-to-face interactions and relationship-building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>. Venture capitalists often prefer product-led or marketing-led customer acquisition due to faster growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. Sales-led motions often require substantial average contract values (ACVs) to build large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.
*   **Media and Social**: Evaluate if the target industry's professionals are active on social media or email. Creative approaches, like an industry-specific newsletter with internal jokes or memes, can be effective in industries like machine shops or trade schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>.

## [[Importance of Wedge Products in Vertical SaaS | Wedge Products]]

A "wedge product" is a "get-in-the-door" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. The goal for vertical SaaS is often to become the all-in-one, one-stop solution, but this is rarely where a business starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.

*   **Characteristics**:
    *   Targets an area with poor existing solutions (paper-based or bad competition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
    *   Addresses a critical need for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.
    *   Easy to implement and deploy quickly (not a 12-month implementation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
    *   Acts as a "reputation prover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
*   **Benefit**: Once customers use and trust the wedge product, it becomes much easier to sell them additional software solutions within your ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.

#### Example: Roofer.com
Roofer.com, a vertical SaaS for roofing companies, started with a proposal tool as their wedge product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.
*   **Problem Solved**: Traditional roofing proposals were awkward and manual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.
*   **Solution**: They created a tool that used Google Maps to generate real-time, preliminary quotes, allowing customers to book appointments directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Roofer.com got paid a percentage of the booking, making it a free tool for the roofing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.
*   **GTM**: This allowed them to acquire roofing companies via marketing (Instagram/Facebook ads), which is unusual for home services industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
*   **Expansion**: After proving value, they expanded to offer a CRM, moving towards an all-in-one solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

A good wedge product follows the money, helps close business, and builds trust with the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.

## Integrating Payments

Adding payment processing capabilities to a vertical SaaS solution is a powerful way to build massive companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. Every major industry-specific software company often owns the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

*   **Market Size Expansion**: By integrating payments and taking a percentage of transactions, the addressable market size can dramatically increase compared to just charging a monthly software fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.
    *   **Example (Toast)**: Charging $10/month for software to 1 million restaurants yields $120 million annually. But if those restaurants do $1 trillion in revenue, taking a small percentage of transactions makes the market size potentially in the billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.
*   **Convenience**: Integrating payments directly into the industry-specific software simplifies operations for the customer, eliminating the need to use separate generic payment processors and manually export data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

## [[Pricing Strategies for Vertical SaaS | Pricing Strategy]]

Pricing is often overlooked in software but is critically important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.

*   **Value-Based Pricing**: Understand how much the problem you are solving currently costs the customer or how much value your solution generates for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>.
*   **Quantify ROI**: Build products that demonstrably increase revenue, decrease costs, prevent churn, or aid compliance, as these areas allow for clear calculation of Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
    *   **Example (Retention Tool for Trade Schools)**: A tool that increased student retention by saving students from dropping out was priced based on the tuition value of those saved students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. If saving five students (each paying $20,000 tuition) means saving $100,000 in revenue, the software can be priced as a portion of that saved revenue (e.g., 20-50%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

The goal is to show the customer that your product costs less than the ROI it delivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.

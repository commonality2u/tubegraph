The concept of in-car advertising, particularly within rideshare services like Uber, presents a significant opportunity for innovative monetization. One existing example, Play Octopus, offers a foundational model, which can be significantly improved upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.

## The Play Octopus Model
Play Octopus is a company that provides tablets on the back of headrests in Uber vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>. These tablets primarily feature trivia games, which can engage passengers and create a lively atmosphere in the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.
*   **Monetization:** Play Octopus generates revenue through display ads shown between trivia rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.
*   **Driver Earnings:** Drivers typically earn a low amount, around $70 per month, from having the tablet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>.
*   **Driver Retention:** Despite low earnings, drivers often keep the tablets because they are already installed and improve the overall ride experience for passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.
*   **Acquisition:** Play Octopus was acquired by T-Mobile in 2022 and generates an estimated $8-10 million in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>.

## Proposed Improvements and Monetization Strategies
The current monetization of Play Octopus is considered inefficient given the captive audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. A more effective strategy would involve:

*   **CPA Ads with QR Codes:** Instead of simple display ads, implement Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) ads that include a QR code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>. When passengers scan the QR code and provide contact information (phone number or email), an affiliate commission is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.
*   **Driver Incentives:** A portion of the affiliate commission should go to the Uber driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>. This provides a strong incentive for drivers to switch to a new service, potentially earning them significantly more than the current $70/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.
    *   Some brands, like CPG companies, are willing to pay around $3 per email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. Even a 10% or 50% share of this to the driver would be substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.
    *   Some offers are Cost Per Lead (CPL) for things like grocery stores, or bundled leads where multiple businesses (e.g., a grocery store, a tire shop) pay for the same lead, increasing the payout to potentially $10 per lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
*   **Network Effect:** Drivers communicate within their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. If a driver starts earning an extra $500 a month, they would likely share this in their groups, creating a natural referral program and rapid adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.
*   **Increased QR Code Adoption:** Post-pandemic, people are more accustomed to scanning QR codes in their daily lives, making this a viable call-to-action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.

### Potential for [[profitable_startup_ideas_using_google_ads | Betting and Prediction Markets]]
A highly profitable, though ethically questionable, pivot of this idea involves turning the in-car tablets into "casinos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.
*   **Partnerships:** Partner with betting companies like FanDuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
*   **Incentives:** Offer free betting credits (e.g., $100) if a passenger scans a QR code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. Given many Uber passengers are coming from bars or heading to sports games, they represent a highly targeted and engaged audience for sports betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.
*   **Prediction Markets:** Implement live prediction market betting on current events (e.g., election outcomes) with a countdown on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>. This leverages the captured audience in the car for impulsive wagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>.

This business model could potentially generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>.

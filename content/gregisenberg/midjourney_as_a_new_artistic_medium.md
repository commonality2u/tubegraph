Midjourney is considered an entirely new artistic medium and a different type of canvas, offering a novel way of problem-solving [00:00:00]. It allows users to blend and balance entire aesthetics with complex layers, finding harmony to achieve desired results [00:00:08]. Once a "recipe" is discovered, it can be infinitely prompted into [00:00:24].

## Beyond Text Prompts
Traditional text prompting is merely the "tip of the iceberg" when it comes to Midjourney's capabilities [00:01:07]. The platform excels when using visuals to drive visuals, rather than relying solely on semantics [00:01:12]. This approach allows users to "explode out Aesthetics and style space into almost like infinite directions" [00:01:16], freeing them from the base model's interpretation of style tokens and enabling them to "pave our own lane" [00:01:29].

Early versions of Midjourney primarily relied on words and parameters [00:01:46]. However, in recent months, features like [[exploring_midjourneys_tools_and_features | Style Space]], [[using_style_references_and_personalization_in_midjourney | style references]], and character references have been introduced [00:02:19]. This system "explodes Aesthetics out into this infinite universe," making the creation process more engaging on a visual canvas [00:02:27].

### Image Prompts vs. Style References
Understanding the distinction between image prompts and style references is crucial:
*   **Image Prompt**: When an image is used as an image prompt, Midjourney attempts to pull in the subject matter and actual pixels of that image [00:20:13]. This can lead to unexpected results if the goal is to transfer style rather than content, potentially blending the image's subject with the prompt's subject (e.g., a "hand giraffe") [00:21:03].
*   **Style Reference (Paperclip Icon)**: Using an image as a style reference (indicated by a paperclip icon) instructs Midjourney to decouple the aesthetic from the subject matter [00:19:52]. It analyzes the image's style elements—such as color, composition, lighting, texture, and pattern—and integrates them into the new generation [00:40:19]. The `--sw` (style weight) parameter can be used to control the influence of the style reference, ranging from 0 to 1000 [00:17:18]. A higher style weight means more influence from the style reference [00:17:40].

### Style Reference Codes (SRF Codes)
Beyond image references, Midjourney utilizes SRF codes, which act as "coordinates in this like multi-dimensional Style Space" [00:37:38]. These codes direct the AI to specific aesthetic locations, influencing anything prompted [00:37:44]. There are billions of possible SRF codes, and users are actively "mining these out of Midjourney, finding the best ones, curating them into lists" [00:38:08]. These codes can be blended like "paint on a palette" to create "aesthetic recipes" or "style potions" [00:40:05].

### Personalization
Midjourney offers a [[using_style_references_and_personalization_in_midjourney | personalization]] feature, which fine-tunes the model to a user's aesthetic preferences [00:32:33]. This is achieved by rating images in the "Personalize" tab [00:29:45]. The more images a user rates, the more Midjourney learns their preferred colors, lighting, general style (photographic vs. illustrative), and even subject matter [00:30:13]. This personalization significantly impacts the aesthetic outcome, providing a unique "vibe" that differs from the community-curated default [00:32:50]. The `--s` (stylize) parameter controls how much of the model's curated aesthetics (including personalization) are applied to the text prompt [00:31:20].

## Artistic Control and Harmony
The creation process in Midjourney is about "balance, Harmony" [00:18:29]. Users have various "aesthetic levers" to pull, including:
*   Style references (images or SRF codes) [00:29:09]
*   Text prompts, which can include specific mediums (e.g., "paper cutout illustration") [00:29:14]
*   Parameters like `--sw` (style weight) and `--ar` (aspect ratio) [00:17:18], [00:19:03]
*   Personalization [00:36:09]
*   The `--no` parameter to exclude elements (e.g., "no text") [00:26:52]

By manipulating these levers, users can guide and push aesthetics in desired directions [00:32:24]. It's a process of visually analyzing results and making guided decisions rather than simply playing a "slot machine game" [00:42:06].

## Practical Applications
Midjourney serves as a powerful tool for [[practical_applications_and_workflows_in_midjourney | creative processes]]:
*   **Inspiration and Ideation**: It's a "discovery engine" for brainstorming ideas, putting together concepts, and exploring aesthetics [00:11:16]. Users can build mood boards more effectively than with traditional image searches [00:11:26].
*   **Production**: With features like the editor, users can manipulate existing assets, out-paint, and add new elements [00:11:52].
*   **Art Therapy**: Many find it a fun and engaging tool to get lost in, akin to art therapy [00:12:14].
*   **Monetization**: High-quality AI art can be indistinguishable from traditional art, serving as personal art, website assets, landing page visuals, or social media content, adding significant value [00:12:55]. There is a potential future for a marketplace where users could sell their "personalization" or curated style reference books [00:36:28].

## Physical Manifestation of AI Art
A lab is being built in Red Hook, in partnership with Pioneer Works, to teach people how to use AI tools like Midjourney deeply [01:00:02]. The goal is to facilitate the "physically manifesting latent space" [00:59:51] by providing equipment such as robots that paint and play music, large 3D printers, plotter printers, and editing stations [01:00:10]. This enables users to bring their digital creations to life and transform them into physical works of art, such as large-scale paintings [01:00:13].

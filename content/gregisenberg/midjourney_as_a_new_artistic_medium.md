From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

[[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]] is characterized as a "new medium entirely," offering a distinct type of canvas and a different approach to problem-solving in art creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's described as a space where entire aesthetics, rather than just paint, can be layered, blended, and balanced to achieve a desired harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Once a successful "recipe" is discovered, it can be infinitely prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Moving Beyond Text Prompting
Initially, [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]] primarily relied on text prompts and [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | parameters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:07">[01:55:07]</a>. While words are still valuable, they represent "just the tip of the iceberg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. The true potential lies in using visuals to drive visuals, allowing users to "explode out aesthetics and style space into almost infinite directions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

Recent developments in [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]] have introduced:
*   **Style Space**: A concept that expands aesthetics into an infinite universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **[[using_style_references_and_personalization_in_midjourney | Style References]]**: The ability to use images as aesthetic guides, influencing the generated output's style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This differs from simple image prompts, which pull in subject matter and elements, potentially making results "wonky" if the intent is only style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Style references decouple aesthetics from subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Character References**: Used for maintaining consistent character appearance (not covered in detail) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **SRF Codes**: These are "coordinates in this multi-dimensional Style Space" that direct prompts to a specific aesthetic location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. There are billions of possible SRF codes that people are actively mining and curating into "aesthetic recipes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Achieving Desired Artistic Outcomes
The core principle in [[creating_art_with_ai_and_blending_aesthetics_in_midjourney | creating art with AI]] in [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]] is finding "balance and harmony" among various aesthetic levers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. These include:

### Parameters
[[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | Parameters]] are used to guide and push aesthetics in specific directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   **Style Weight (`--sw`)**: Determines the influence of a [[using_style_references_and_personalization_in_midjourney | style reference]] on the generation, ranging from 100 (default) to 1000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratio (`--ar`)**: Controls the image's dimensions, useful for specific outputs like posters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **No Parameter (`--no`)**: Tells [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]] what elements to remove from the generation, such as unwanted text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Stylize (`--s`)**: Controls how much of the [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]] model's curated aesthetics are applied to the text prompt. Higher values make the image look "more like Midjourney" or "scream AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Permutation Prompts**: Using brackets and commas `{option1, option2}` allows running multiple [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | parameter]] values in one go for quick visual comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### [[using_style_references_and_personalization_in_midjourney | Personalization]]
[[using_style_references_and_personalization_in_midjourney | Personalization]] fine-tunes the [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]] model to a user's aesthetic preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This is achieved by rating images in the "Personalize" tab, teaching [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]] about preferred colors, lighting, general style (photographic vs. illustrative), and even specific subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Rating a thousand images can significantly improve aesthetic alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### Blending Styles
[[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]] allows for [[creating_art_with_ai_and_blending_aesthetics_in_midjourney | blending aesthetics]] by combining multiple [[using_style_references_and_personalization_in_midjourney | style references]] or SRF codes in a single prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:82:00">[02:82:00]</a>. Users can assign specific weights to each style using double colons (e.g., `srf_code::2 srf_code_2::1`) to control their influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. SRF codes represent complex aesthetic qualities like color, composition, lighting, texture, and pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

## Workflow and Exploration
The typical workflow involves:
1.  **Starting Point**: Begin with a subject and a general medium (e.g., painting, illustration, photograph) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
2.  **Inspiration**:
    *   Find inspiration from external sources like Pinterest, Reddit, or Google Images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
    *   Utilize [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]]'s "Explore" tab, which displays public generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Users can search for styles (e.g., "vintage poster") and perform image searches to find similar results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
3.  **Initial Prompting**: Start with a basic idea and a [[using_style_references_and_personalization_in_midjourney | style reference]] to observe how [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]] interprets the style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
4.  **Refinement**:
    *   Adjust [[parameters_and_controls_for_achieving_desired_artistic_outcomes_with_midjourney | parameters]] like style weight to increase the influence of the [[using_style_references_and_personalization_in_midjourney | style reference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
    *   Refine the text prompt to provide "assistance" and guide the output (e.g., "paper cutout illustration of a giraffe") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
    *   Experiment with aspect ratios for desired layouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
5.  **Variations**: Generate subtle or strong variations of preferred images to explore different compositions while maintaining the general vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
6.  **In-App Editing**: Utilize the editor feature to "paint out" unwanted elements like text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
7.  **Organization**: "Liking" favorite generations helps organize and find them later in the library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Work in the Web App
> [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]] is no longer primarily in Discord. Users should transition to the [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]] web app at midjourney.com for a better workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Public Generations and Stealth Mode
> By default, generations on [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]]'s standard plan are public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. For client work or proprietary imagery, it's crucial to use the Pro Plan or above and activate "stealth mode" in the settings to prevent assets from appearing in the public database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

## Practical Applications
[[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]] serves as a powerful inspiration tool, similar to creating mood boards, but with enhanced control over the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. It's excellent for ideating, exploring concepts, and can be used in production, especially with its new editor feature for out-painting or adding elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Beyond professional use, it can be a form of "art therapy" due to its immersive and addictive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. The ultimate value lies in transforming ideas into "living breathing assets" for personal art, websites, or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## Future Vision: Physical Manifestation
The future of [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | Midjourney]] and other [[ai_tools_like_midjourney_and_chat_gpt | AI tools]] extends [[exploring_aigenerated_art_beyond_text_prompting | beyond text prompting]] and digital creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. There's a movement towards "physically manifesting latent space" – bringing AI-generated art into the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>. This includes using robots to paint and play music, large-format printers, and 3D printers to turn digital creations into tangible objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>. This represents a step towards creating truly "Van Gogh-level" art on the fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

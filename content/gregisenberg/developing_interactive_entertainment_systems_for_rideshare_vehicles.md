The concept of integrating interactive entertainment systems into rideshare vehicles presents a significant business opportunity, particularly by improving existing models. One example is the "Play Octopus" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>.

## Current Model: Play Octopus

Play Octopus involves a tablet mounted on the back of a rideshare headrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>. Its primary function is to offer trivia games to passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

### Passenger & Driver Experience
Passengers often engage enthusiastically with the trivia, creating a more lively atmosphere in the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>. Drivers also report that the tablet leads to "better ride vibes," making their job more enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.

### Financials and Monetization
*   **Driver Earnings**: Drivers typically earn around $70 per month from the tablet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. Despite the low earnings, drivers tend to keep the tablets because they're already installed and improve the passenger experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.
*   **Company Acquisition**: Play Octopus was acquired by T-Mobile in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>.
*   **Revenue**: The company generates approximately $8-10 million in revenue annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.
*   **Monetization Strategy**: Their current monetization relies primarily on basic display advertisements shown between trivia games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>.

## Opportunities for Improved Monetization

The current model is seen as having "terrible monetization" despite being a "great product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. A more effective strategy would focus on performance-based advertising and leveraging the captive audience.

### Proposed Business Model
A new company could implement the same trivia-based system but revolutionize the advertising model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>.

1.  **CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) Ads with QR Codes**:
    *   Instead of display ads, integrate CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) ads featuring QR codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>.
    *   When a passenger scans the QR code and provides contact information (phone number or email), an affiliate commission is generated for both the system provider and the Uber driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
    *   This model is viable due to the widespread adoption of QR code scanning in daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.
    *   Examples include CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) brands willing to pay around $3 for an email lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.

2.  **Cost Per Lead (CPL) Model**:
    *   Partnerships with local businesses (e.g., grocery stores, tire shops) could pay for leads generated through QR code scans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:53">[01:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.
    *   These leads could be bundled for higher payouts, where multiple businesses share the cost of a lead and send initial offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.

3.  **Enhanced Driver Incentives**:
    *   By giving drivers a substantial share of the affiliate commission (e.g., 10% or even 50/50), their monthly earnings could increase significantly, potentially from $70 to $500 or even $1,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>.
    *   This higher incentive would overcome any "switching cost" for drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.
    *   The tablets could be provided free to drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.

4.  **Network Effects and Referral Programs**:
    *   Rideshare drivers are often part of online or physical groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.
    *   A driver making substantially more money would share this success within their network, leading to rapid organic adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.
    *   Implementing a referral program for drivers would further accelerate growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.

5.  **Targeted Betting/Prediction Markets**:
    *   For a highly profitable, though potentially ethically questionable, application, the screens could be used for gambling or prediction markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.
    *   Partnerships with legal betting companies (e.g., FanDuel) could offer free betting credits for scanning QR codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.
    *   Prediction markets, like betting on election outcomes with a countdown, could engage passengers who are a "captured audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>.
    *   This is especially relevant for Ubers heading to sports events, where the audience is primed for sports betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.

### Implementation and Potential
This enhanced model could operate with a lean team, potentially just five engineers and one salesperson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>. By significantly improving monetization, a company implementing this strategy could easily scale beyond the current $10 million annual revenue, potentially reaching $50 million or even $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>. The core idea is to find good products with suboptimal monetization and improve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>.

This article explores various strategies for [[monetizing_ai_apps | monetizing AI applications]] and developing new media formats. It delves into how artificial intelligence (AI) is creating fresh opportunities for entrepreneurs, particularly in transforming one-way media into interactive experiences, and identifying new business models beyond traditional subscriptions.

## AI-Enhanced Media and Voice Interaction

AI is enabling a shift towards more interactive media formats. One proposed idea, "advanced voice notes," involves a system where voice recordings (e.g., from a business strategy session) are summarized, and then collaborators can "talk to the transcript" to delve deeper into the reasoning behind decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This concept aims to provide richer context and reduce follow-up questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

A related internal incubation, called "tldr," transforms meetings into short podcasts that summarize key takeaways in about three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This prototype also includes the ability for a user to interrupt the podcast and have a conversation with the AI host for clarification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This indicates a future where media is conversational and interactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, prompting entrepreneurs to consider how to turn existing one-way media into two-way experiences with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Monetization Models for Conversational Media

When considering [[monetizing_ai_apps | monetizing these AI-driven media formats]], focusing on B2B or prosumer applications may be more lucrative for bootstrapped founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. New technologies like AI create opportunities for entirely new media formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> by making storytelling significantly cheaper than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This allows for stories to be told in contexts that were previously too expensive, such as AI summarizing meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The "total addressable market" lies in identifying places where stories can be told that were previously cost-prohibitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Regarding charging models, one consideration is basing it on the "number of downloads or plays or listens," as this scales with the value derived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. There's a growing trend in AI pricing to move away from monthly subscriptions towards charging "per successfully completed task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, reflecting a desire to avoid subscription fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Voice-First Interfaces

The rise of voice-activated assistants like Siri and advanced voice modes in AI models is fostering a new "oral culture" where interaction with computers and the environment will increasingly be via voice instead of text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. This trend is particularly noticeable among younger generations who are growing up with voice as a natural interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

This presents a significant opportunity for businesses to develop "voice-first interfaces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. For example, a voice-first version of an online travel agency like Expedia could capture a significant market share by offering a user experience specifically "dialed in" for voice interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. While large companies might eventually integrate voice, their reluctance to "piss off their regular users" by making drastic interface changes gives startups a "tremendous advantage" to innovate and capture early adopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

## Data as a Service and New Business Models

Another area for AI-driven startups involves leveraging data. Inspired by platforms like Kaggle, which serve as marketplaces for data scientists to solve bounties on data sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, the concept of "n of one" proposes a platform where individuals or businesses can post their own personal or business data sets and offer bounties for useful predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The accessibility of AI models like GPT-4 means "everyone's a data scientist" now, capable of deriving interesting insights from data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This approach shifts traditional scientific inquiry from generalized explanations based on large studies to creating predictive models for individuals, or "n of one," to solve specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

This concept leads to the "database as a service" (DaaS) business model, where curated data is put behind a paywall and sold, often promoted through social audiences or paid advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## Luxury and AI-Generated Content

AI's ability to significantly reduce the cost of creating content also opens up opportunities in the luxury market. New versions of classic "great books" could be created, tailored and translated into engaging formats (audio, video, interactive) for specific audiences, such as tech-savvy individuals in their 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. This could disrupt traditional study aid markets like CliffsNotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a> and appeal to intellectuals who aspire to familiarity with the Western Canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

Monetization could involve one-off access, subscriptions, or creating "beautiful physical versions" of these books as luxury goods, with companion digital components that enhance consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. This taps into a trend where things made cheaper by technology often become luxury status goods (e.g., Broadway shows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. The opportunity lies in identifying what AI is making cheaper and then reimagining those items as expensive, handmade, or limited-edition "status symbols" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>, particularly focusing on "human-made and handmade" aspects to give them status over AI-made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_promoting_and_distributing_ai_apps | Strategies for Promoting and Distributing AI Apps]]

For entrepreneurs launching AI apps, a strong distribution strategy is crucial. One effective approach is to build a media business and audience first, such as a newsletter, to act as a distribution channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. By writing about topics of genuine interest, a creator attracts an engaged audience with similar characteristics, allowing them to build products for themselves that will also appeal to their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. This "distribution first" approach allows for immediate access to hundreds or thousands of early users on launch day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

While newsletters were once a prime growth channel, YouTube is now a highly recommended starting point for content creation, with the goal of funneling viewers into a newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. Platforms like ConvertKit (now Kit.com) allow for audience segmentation, enabling creators to send targeted invitations to their apps to the right users at the right time, ensuring valuable feedback and community building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. The current AI wave "resets the playing field," offering abundant "low-hanging fruit" for building apps that serve personal needs and then scaling them to a like-minded audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.

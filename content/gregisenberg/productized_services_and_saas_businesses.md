From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

The modern business landscape is increasingly defined by two models: [[productized_services_for_agencies | productized services]] and [[microsaas_business_ideas | SaaS businesses]]. These models offer significant advantages, particularly when leveraged with "owned media" channels like YouTube and podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Owned media provides the "rails" for content distribution, allowing creators to put out anything they want and attract an audience interested in similar things, which can then be monetized through products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This approach allows businesses to operate without geographical constraints, such as needing to live in expensive cities like New York or San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It's seen as essential for playing at a "pro level" in the current business environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Advantages of Owned Media

Younger generations are observed to be "printing money" on YouTube and using that revenue to subsidize the development of [[productized_services_for_agencies | productized services]] and [[microsaas_business_ideas | SaaS companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Having owned media channels enables a company to go from "zero to one" in 30 days and be cash flow positive and sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. This approach allows founders to gain deep trust with a large audience in a one-to-many format, generating inbound leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. It also provides a leverage point for individuals without traditional pedigrees, enabling global reach for good ideas shared regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>.

## Case Study: Cricut SVG SaaS Business

An example of a successful [[microsaas_business_ideas | SaaS business]] built through this model is an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) company for Cricut users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
This business was reportedly built in about 72 hours as a weekend project using off-the-shelf tools like Shopify and various Shopify apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Key aspects of its operation:
*   **AI Integration:** The entire build-out leverages [[utilizing_ai_tools_and_platforms_for_rapid_saas_prototyping | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Designs are created using Midjourney by prompting it to make black and white images with white backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Images are then upscaled and turned into vectors using an [[utilizing_ai_tools_and_platforms_for_rapid_saas_prototyping | AI vectorizing tool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This allows for unlimited products or SKUs based on user search keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Pricing Model:** The business employs a freemium model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Users must sign up with their email to download free products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Premium products require a paid subscription, which is currently $3.99 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Low Costs:** The main costs are associated with Meta ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity:** With 10 million Cricut users, the business can scale significantly by being a "barnacle on the whale" of a massive, already validated market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Productized Service Ideas

### LinkedIn Video Agency for Founders
This [[productized_services_for_agencies | productized service]] aims to help founders build strong personal brands on LinkedIn, especially with LinkedIn rolling out a "for you page" feed similar to TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The content on LinkedIn is currently seen as low quality, presenting a "blue ocean" opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

*   **Service Model:**
    *   Interview founders weekly for an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
    *   Develop scripts from the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   Guide founders on recording (inflection, pacing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
    *   Create and schedule short video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   Analyze data for content optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Pricing:** Estimated from $2,500 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition:** Creates massive personal brand opportunities and inbound lead generation for companies, leveraging LinkedIn's free organic reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Go-to-Market Strategy:** Start by creating your own LinkedIn content demonstrating the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Build a free community for founders seeking to grow on LinkedIn, offering tips and breakdowns of successful posts. Then upsell to the done-for-you service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### AI Automation as a Service
This concept focuses on providing [[utilizing_ai_tools_and_platforms_for_rapid_saas_prototyping | AI automation]] solutions to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
The search volume for "AI automation" is rapidly growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

*   **Service Model:**
    *   Consulting: Build a consulting company to set up automations using tools like Make.com, Zapier, and ChatGPT APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
    *   [[productized_services_for_agencies | Productized Service]]: Offer an "embedded AI automation engineer" to automate various business processes, particularly "paper pushing" tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
*   **Pricing:** Potentially $8,000 per month due to instant cost savings for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. A mental model for [[pricing_strategies_for_vertical_saas | pricing]] is to determine how much cost will be saved and then charge a percentage of that saving (e.g., if $200,000 is saved, charge $20,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
*   **Distribution Strategy:** Bid on keywords like "AI automation" and related terms (Zapier, Make.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Create tutorials using [[utilizing_ai_tools_and_platforms_for_rapid_saas_prototyping | AI tools]] (e.g., Perplexity AI) for common setups, with a call to action for consulting services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

### AI Graphic Designer SaaS (Co-Pilot)
There's a perceived gap in the market for an [[utilizing_ai_tools_and_platforms_for_rapid_saas_prototyping | AI graphic designer]] tool that can integrate with a brand's style guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

*   **Concept:** A tool where users input brand colors, logos, and fonts, then prompt it to create assets like podcast thumbnails, email headers, or Facebook ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.
*   **Desired Functionality:** It doesn't need to be perfect, just "good enough" (e.g., 80% as good as a human graphic designer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. The goal is speed, providing variations of ideas and ensuring proper white space and alignment based on brand guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
*   **Analogy:** Similar to [[utilizing_ai_tools_and_platforms_for_rapid_saas_prototyping | AI writing tools]] that produce better outputs when given good source material (brand style guides in this case) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
*   **Pricing Opportunity:** Existing services like Design Pickle charge around $499 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. An [[utilizing_ai_tools_and_platforms_for_rapid_saas_prototyping | AI-augmented]] service could charge significantly less, potentially $99 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>, and allow for multi-threading of requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.
*   **Potential Exit:** If successful, this type of software could be an acquisition target for larger design platforms like Canva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.

### Newsletter Service for Founders
Many founders want a newsletter but don't want to write it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

*   **Service Model:** Interview founders for an hour, then transform the transcript into a newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. [[utilizing_ai_tools_and_platforms_for_rapid_saas_prototyping | AI]] can be used to translate raw data into the founder's tone and style, getting it 95% of the way there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.
*   **Growth Strategy:**
    *   **Scraping:** Scrape emails from existing Twitter or LinkedIn followers of the founder (e.g., 40-50% valid emails from Twitter followers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. Use tools like SalesQL for LinkedIn connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>. Validate emails and sequence them into the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.
    *   **Automation:** Automate DMs to new connections on LinkedIn and new followers on Twitter, inviting them to subscribe to the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition:** Provides an owned distribution channel that builds deeper relationships with followers and customers, and offers "schmuck insurance" against platform dependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. Founders will view this as a return on audience spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>.

### YouTube Thumbnail and Title Library
A subscription service offering a library of plug-and-play YouTube thumbnails and titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.

*   **Market:** YouTube is a dominant platform for creators due to its monetization and high RPMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. Creators often end up on YouTube for long-term monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.
*   **Service Model:**
    *   Provide a library of templates where users can swap out assets (e.g., their face) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
    *   Combine with titles, as they are equally important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.
    *   Integrate data (e.g., from VidIQ API) to show performance metrics (impressions, views) for thumbnail/title combinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
    *   Incorporate trend analysis, as thumbnails and titles have a shelf life due to audience fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Distribution Strategy:** Scrape email addresses of YouTubers (e.g., over 10,000 subscribers in the USA, specific keyword categories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>. Cold email them, offering initial free access (e.g., 10 free thumbnails) with an upsell to a paid tier for full access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

### Canva Video Captioning App
A software tool (or app) that integrates with Canva to provide good video captioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.

*   **Problem:** Canva currently lacks robust video captioning features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>.
*   **Solution:** An app that transcribes uploaded video using a large Whisper model, then applies Canva's font styles and offers variations like karaoke effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity:** Canva is one of the fastest-growing video editors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>, and there's clear search volume for this feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>. Competing tools like Veed.io offer this functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.
*   **Business Model:** A subscription-based [[microsaas_business_ideas | SaaS business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.
*   **Exit Strategy:** Build to $20K/month in revenue, generate PR (TechCrunch, etc.), and then approach Canva for an acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.

### Niche Flight Deals Newsletter
Resurrecting the "cheap flights" business model, but with a more localized and low-code approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

*   **Concept:** Use Google Flights alerts (which notify users when prices drop for specific city pairs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>. Aggregate these alerts into a newsletter for specific major metro areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
*   **Monetization:** Subscription fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a> and potentially affiliate kickbacks from flight booking sites like Kiwi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.
*   **Low-Code Implementation:** Possible with a Zapier setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.
*   **Growth:** Target frequent travelers on Facebook ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>. The newsletter itself could encourage organic growth through forwarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.
*   **Expansion:** If successful for one city, expand to all major metros in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>, or globally if US/Canada domains are taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>. Could also expand into "what's happening in my city" content to increase stickiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity:** This leverages a validated concept (Scott's Cheap Flights, now going.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>, but focuses on niche markets where existing offerings lack "soul" or modern aesthetics (e.g., YYZdeals.com in Canada) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>.

## SaaS Business Ideas

### QuickBooks for X (Vertical SaaS)
The idea is to create specialized accounting software, similar to QuickBooks, but niched down for specific industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This is a [[building_vertical_saas_businesses | vertical SaaS]] approach, as exemplified by Finaloop (e-commerce accounting software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.

*   **Strategy for [[choosing_industries_for_vertical_saas | Choosing Industries]]**:
    *   Examine QuickBooks extensions to identify industries integrating with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
    *   Look for large categories with less competition (e.g., avoiding highly competitive internet businesses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.
    *   Examples: QuickBooks for Airbnb entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>, real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>, or even nonprofits (4,400 searches/month for "nonprofits") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.
*   **Distribution Strategy:** Cold email target businesses (e.g., every Shopify owner for D2C accounting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.
*   **Underlying Principle:** Identify larger platforms or business categories and build a custom solution for their specific accounting needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>.

## Broader Business Principles

*   **Ride Larger Trends:** Always look for larger trends to attach your company to, rather than trying to educate the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. Sell what people already want to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.
*   **Content as a Grind (but worth it):** While content creation can be a grind, it's not as demanding as perceived if done consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. The key is to find a sustainable rhythm and delegate operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.
*   **Founder as Editor/Conductor:** Founders should view themselves more as editors or conductors of content, curating ideas and setting up systems to produce content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **"Done for You" Solutions:** Many founders have limited time and mental bandwidth, making "done for you" services highly appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
*   **Personal Brand as Leverage:** Building a large audience on platforms like Twitter or YouTube grants significant leverage and allows founders to "do whatever they want" in their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:15:43]</a>. It enables cross-promotion across channels and creates owned distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.
*   **Monetization of Attention:** The new business model involves converting attention into revenue, where views and subscribers on platforms like YouTube directly subsidize the cost of building an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.
*   **VCs as Customers:** Venture Capital firms are also increasingly interested in building their own media presence to attract deal flow, presenting an opportunity to sell content creation and media services to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. They value "attention and audience" for attracting the best founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>.
*   **Unsexy Blue Oceans:** Look for "unsexy" niche markets where blue ocean opportunities (low competition, high demand) exist to build media and subsequently companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>.
*   **Consistency and Authenticity:** Showing up consistently and being authentic is crucial for building an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. Don't try to be someone you're not, as this is exhausting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.
*   **Creating Digital Gravity:** Build as much "digital mass" (content) on the internet as possible to create "digital gravity" and increase serendipity for your brand or self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>.
*   **Knowledge as Leverage:** Ungatekeeping knowledge and sharing it publicly attracts interested individuals and builds reputation, knowledge, and leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.
*   **Sales in Disguise:** Podcasts and other media platforms can serve as effective sales tools, generating inbound volume for products and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.

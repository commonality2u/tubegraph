The concept of credibility and status plays a crucial role in business success, influencing everything from customer perception to marketing strategies. Businesses can leverage perceived value to enhance their offerings and increase revenue.

## The Power of Credibility

Credibility in business is highly valued, and companies actively seek ways to demonstrate their trustworthiness and excellence.

### Plaques and Badges
One tangible way to display credibility is through awards and certifications. The idea of a "best product of the year" or "best e-commerce brand of the year" business involves creating and selling plaques and digital badges that companies can display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This concept is not new; the Better Business Bureau, for example, generates millions of dollars annually by selling an image that signifies legitimacy and an A+ rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

While many founders and Indie hackers attempt to build trust by splashing "trusted at" logos or testimonials on their websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, these can often be "glossed over" by consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. However, a clear "top product of the year" image could make consumers more willing to try an app like Granola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Such a product could potentially charge $200 per year for a digital sticker or a physical plaque, similar to the YouTube 100k subscriber plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This acknowledges a product's quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

A similar model is seen with platforms like Product Hunt, which allows products to receive "product of the day" accolades, leading to plaques that can be placed on websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. Trending on Product Hunt is a significant credibility booster within the Indie hacking community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

### Making Noise to Build Authority
To establish the value of such credibility symbols, it's crucial to "make noise" to attract attention and generate supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. This noise, created through channels like podcasts or online content, funnels traffic to a specific page, building recognition and authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to make enough noise with the right authority for companies to value the plaque enough to pay for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. The appealing aspect of selling badges or images is the high profit margin, potentially up to 99% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

## Embeddable Businesses and Status Symbols

The concept of "embeddable businesses" that own real estate on other people's websites is seen as a significant trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. These businesses can passively market themselves through their integration.

### Self-Marketing Through Embeds
Products like the offer button (offerbutton.com), which allows users to make offers to buy websites, are examples of embeddable businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Similarly, invoicing software like Xero includes "sent with Xero" at the bottom of invoices, and newsletter platforms like Beehiiv do the same for emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. This acts as automatic marketing, leveraging the authority of the website or user who embeds the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.

A historical example is Gmail, which became popular in 2004-2005 partly through an invite-only system and the "sent with Gmail" footer in every email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. This model allows the embeddable business to "lift on the authority" of its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.

### Luxury Software and Aesthetic Value
The discussion extends to "luxury software" like Superhuman, which is more expensive but acts as a status symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. Features like "sent with Superhuman" are important within these luxury products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. This ties into the idea of "aesthetic software," where users might subconsciously want to show they take design seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>.

> "If you spend $7,000 on a Louis Vuitton bag, you're wearing the bag not because it's great leather; you want other people to see you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.

Aesthetics contribute significantly to the perceived value of a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. Clean, clear, and well-designed interfaces help products stand out in a world of information overload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>. While the core functionality (the "car that drives") is paramount, a good aesthetic on a landing page can grab attention in the early stages of product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>. Animations on a landing page can also go a long way in capturing user interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>.

## Incentivization and the "Influencer" Class System

The concept of incentivizing social sharing is emerging, where local businesses offer free products or credits for sharing photos on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a>. This leads to the idea of a "log in with influencer" button on e-commerce websites, where users connecting their social profiles (e.g., YouTube with hundreds of thousands of subscribers) could unlock lower price points or exclusive products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>. This benefits the business by potentially driving more purchases or exposure, and the influencer by getting preferential treatment based on their "social status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:03:00">[33:03:00]</a>.

However, concerns arise about creating a "dual class system" or "have or have nots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:28:00">[37:28:00]</a>. If 99.9% of users are not eligible for benefits, offering such an option could distract and frustrate the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:29:00">[36:29:00]</a>. A potential solution is a filtering system or reversing the approach: instead of a public button, brands could proactively identify and reach out to influencers, offering benefits discreetly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04:00">[38:04:00]</a>. This way, influencers receive benefits without creating a public display of differential treatment.

This concept highlights how brands are willing to reward status and reach for marketing purposes, but the *method* of leveraging that status must be carefully considered to avoid negative customer experiences.

Effective marketing and branding contribute significantly to perceived status and credibility.

### Shopify Ecosystem Opportunity
The Shopify app ecosystem offers significant opportunities for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:00]</a>. Companies like instant, which build instant page builders on Shopify, leverage the platform's infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31:00">[41:31:00]</a>. These tools can automatically generate optimized designs using AI, allowing merchants to launch aesthetically pleasing stores quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:52:00">[42:52:00]</a>.

Another example is a fulfillment business that built a Shopify app to integrate Last Mile carriers, hiding the China origin of products by only providing USBs tracking links to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:22:00">[44:22:00]</a>. This enhanced the customer experience and improved the brand perception for Ecom businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:47:00">[44:47:00]</a>.

The Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) space is seen as incredibly dynamic, with ample money flowing for solutions that save time, increase convenience, and boost conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:02:00">[45:02:00]</a>. Building on the Shopify infrastructure is highly favored due to its size and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:31:00">[45:31:00]</a>.

### Identifying Pain Points and Niching Down
To succeed in an ecosystem like Shopify, it's essential to [[importance_of_identifying_and_understanding_your_niche | understand specific pain points]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:56:00">[45:56:00]</a>. This often comes from personal experience or deep immersion in a problem, like understanding the challenges of dealing with Chinese manufacturers (language barriers, distance, cultural differences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>.

It is advised to [[importance_of_identifying_and_understanding_your_niche | niche down]] further within broad areas like supply chain, CRO (conversion rate optimization), or after-sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:00">[50:07:00]</a>. By focusing on specific problems for particular groups (e.g., CRO for construction workers), businesses can find numerous opportunities and create a more defensible moat against larger competitors like Google or Shopify itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:29:00">[50:29:00]</a>.

The DTC landscape offers continuous cash flow, making it easier to justify recurring monthly subscriptions for apps that solve significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:14:00">[49:14:00]</a>. This contrasts with more competitive SAS niches where pricing can be harder to justify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:48:00">[49:48:00]</a>.

## [[Personal branding and business channels | Personal Branding and Business Channels]]

When it comes to content creation, particularly on platforms like YouTube, the approach to promoting products and businesses is evolving.

Traditional calls to action (like "like, comment, and subscribe") are perceived as becoming "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. Instead, the focus shifts to a more authentic promotion through documentation: "showing what's happening and talking about what has happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. This means sharing the journey of [[building_a_brand_and_creating_influence | building a brand]] and its associated lessons without explicitly "screaming in their face or wanting to sell anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

The goal of this approach is not to directly promote businesses but to take the audience through the learnings of building them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>. This fosters interest, and those who want to find out more will naturally do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>. Engagement is still valued, but rather than asking for likes, creators might encourage direct messages or tweets to gauge content resonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>. This strategy contributes to building a stronger, more authentic [[personal_branding_and_business_channels | personal brand]] that indirectly supports business ventures.

Apps are achieving millions of downloads by mastering TikTok, a channel often considered a "black box" by many marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Joseph Choy, an expert in blowing up consumer apps, shares the formula for acquiring users through this platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## TikTok as an Underpriced Distribution Channel
TikTok organic is identified as potentially the biggest underpriced distribution channel currently available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The cost of creating and distributing content on TikTok is extremely low, making it accessible for all types of consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Many apps are achieving significant growth, such as one AI app that garnered four million downloads in 90 days and makes $3 million per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Borrowing Tactics from E-commerce
A significant trend in [[growth_strategies_for_consumer_mobile_apps | consumer app growth tactics]] is the adoption of strategies from the e-commerce space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. TikTok Shop, released in November 2022, has driven rapid marketing innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Examples from E-commerce
*   **Tabs Chocolate**: This e-commerce company scaled from zero to $10 million annually by using mass User-Generated Content (UGC) creators, hiring teenagers, and mass-producing content daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The founder later pivoted to a micro-SaaS that uses similar marketing tactics for a consumer SaaS business, benefiting from higher margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Colostrum products (Miracle Moo)**: Companies sell supplements using AI-generated images (Midjourney) and popular audio clips with "point of view" (POV) hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. These videos go viral by addressing common pain points, directing traffic to e-commerce sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The same strategy can be applied to solve pain points with an app instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Content Formats: Carousels vs. Talking Head Videos
*   **Carousels/Slideshows**: These formats, often featuring AI-generated images (Midjourney) and text, are surprisingly effective on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. They require less effort to create compared to videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   **Example: POV App**: This disposable camera app uses negative hooks and slideshows, featuring AI-generated faces and repetitive visual hooks (like cake on the face) that oddly get views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
    *   While carousels may have lower conversion rates than human-led talking head videos, they offer much greater scale and a lower barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Talking Head Videos**: Companies like Goalie (a supplement company) use TikTok Shop to recruit creators who make talking head videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Goalie offers significant prizes (MacBooks, Rolexes, Teslas) on top of affiliate commissions to monopolize creators, making it hard for competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This high competition is another reason to consider slideshows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## Leveraging TikTok Shop Affiliate Data
The TikTok Shop Affiliate Center offers valuable data on high-volume products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. By filtering by industry (e.g., skincare) and performance, marketers can find creators who are effectively selling e-commerce products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Opportunity: Apps Instead of E-commerce Products
The key insight is that these established TikTok Shop creators, incentivized by large e-commerce companies, could instead be promoting apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

*   **Example: What Colors App**: This [[ai_app_marketing_strategies | AI-based app]] analyzes hair color, skin tone, and eye color to recommend clothes and makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. It's a simple slideshow with a call to action to download the app, achieving almost a million likes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
    *   **Business Model**: Many of these single-utility apps use a paywall model, often with weekly or annual subscriptions after an initial scan or onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Apple Pay's "Double Tap to Pay" has simplified the user experience, leading to a boom in iOS subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
*   **App Store Discovery vs. Social Media**: Unlike the early App Store era where apps were discovered through features, today, TikTok and Instagram are the primary discovery channels for apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. TikTok traffic can also boost an app's ranking in the App Store, leading to long-term organic downloads through App Store Optimization (ASO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   **Creating Complementary Apps**: Develop apps that help existing TikTok shop creators sell their e-commerce products better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
    *   **Example: Skincare App**: A skincare app could analyze a user's face and suggest products, or even create a "before and after" video where the app is used as a utility to show transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. Influencers might use such an app for free if it helps them make content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
    *   Digital products are easier to get users to purchase (e.g., $5 for an app vs. $100 for a physical product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. They also have zero cost of goods, making them infinitely scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

## High LTV Niches for App Marketing
While TikTok's user base is generally young, there's a wide demographic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Targeting niches with fewer creators but higher-spending demographics can be highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

*   **Golf**: Golfers are a high-value demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. An [[ai_app_marketing_strategies | AI-based app]] for golf swing analysis, providing tips on angle and speed, could act as an AI golf coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Top apps in this niche are making significant revenue (e.g., $70,000/month from 10,000 downloads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. The alternative (in-person coaching) is expensive and inconvenient ($125 for 60 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   **MMA/Sports**: The KO app, an MMA training app, uses a "wireframe skeleton" visual effect to analyze movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. This concept can be applied to other sports like tennis, pickleball, and skiing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. The visual "wow factor" works well on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. Modern phone cameras and AI Vision APIs (like GPT Vision, newly released) make this feasible without external cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.
*   **Poker**: Poker players are considered an excellent customer base with high lifetime value (LTV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. Most poker content is under-monetized (selling courses or sponsored by gambling sites) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. An app that analyzes hand history, strategies, or offers beginner tips could be integrated into existing popular poker videos on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. Briefly flashing the app interface in gameplay videos can drive curiosity and downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

## Rethinking [[influencer_marketing_on_tik_tok | Influencer marketing on Tik Tok]]
Traditional [[influencer_marketing_for_app_promotion | influencer marketing for app promotion]] from the Instagram era, focused on paying influencers with millions of followers, is not the most effective approach on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

### TikTok's For You Page Algorithm
TikTok's algorithm prioritizes content on the "For You Page" (FYP), meaning users primarily see content from new or unfamiliar accounts, not necessarily those they follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>. This shifts the focus from an influencer's existing audience to the quality and virality of the content itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.

### Influencers as Actors, Not Directors or Audience
On TikTok, creators can be hired purely as "actors" or "talent" without needing a large following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
*   The "director" role (creating the video) and "audience" role are less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.
*   Marketers should avoid being overly prescriptive (making the video feel like an ad) or giving too much creative freedom (influencers avoiding direct selling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.
*   **Strategy: New Brand Accounts**: Companies like Tabs Chocolate and Airbuds create new brand accounts for each creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. This is cheap as it uses small creators who make new accounts, allowing the algorithm to serve specialized content to consistent audiences without confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
*   **Example: Locks Club**: An exclusive dating app for Jewish people, Locks Club creates content series like "how to find a nice Jewish boy in NYC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>. When a format works, creating dedicated new accounts for that specific content type (e.g., street content) helps the algorithm serve it to the right audience more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

## Cult Movements and High-Value Apps
Building apps around existing "cult-like" movements or ideologies can lead to significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>.
*   **Looksmaxing (Umax App)**: Umax, a looksmaxing app, scans faces, provides scores, and offers tips to improve physical appearance (jawline, skin, hair) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. It capitalized on the deep-rooted "looksmaxing" internet movement, making millions annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.
*   **Wealth (Crayo App)**: Crayo partnered with YouTubers and TikTokers who teach teenagers how to make money online (e.g., clipping streamer videos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. Instead of selling a course, Crayo productizes the process by providing software to automate video creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>.
*   **Framework for Finding Ideas**: Focus on universal human desires: health, wealth, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. Identify movements or communities within these areas that don't yet have a product attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

## Key Considerations for [[viral_consumer_app_growth_tactics | Viral Consumer App Growth Tactics]]
### Product Quality and Retention
Even with excellent [[using_social_media_and_influencers_for_app_marketing | social media and influencer marketing]], the product must be high-quality and retain users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>.
*   Before scaling marketing, ensure the app isn't a "leaky bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>.
*   Understand metrics like Lifetime Value (LTV) and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by tracking downloads, paid conversions, and retention rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>. A good product allows for greater marketing spend and better optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.
*   The goal of an app, unlike a one-time e-commerce product, is scalability and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.

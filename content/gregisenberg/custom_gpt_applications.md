The emergence of a new AI world presents opportunities for building diverse applications and rethinking existing online tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The ability to create complex digital pages without extensive coding is now feasible with tools like [[efficient_use_of_ai_tools_like_chatgpt_and_cursor_ai | Cursor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Open Pages and Personal Customization
Historically, "open pages" were used by startups to publicly share stats like revenue or user numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. More recently, the concept has expanded to personal open pages, sharing aspects of one's life such as books being read or exercise habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

With new tools, individuals can easily create custom open pages for almost anything, including supplements taken, exercise routines, or glucose monitor readings, with the ability to select what information is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

For instance, a surfing stats page was created using [[efficient_use_of_ai_tools_like_chatgpt_and_cursor_ai | Cursor]] by someone who had never coded before, demonstrating the power of these new tools to build dynamic, personalized pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This page tracked surfing frequency, locations, and even included dynamic animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

> "Open pages" can be a reflection of one's personality, combining art and data to visually represent one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

An "OpenPages" tool could be developed, offering a free, simple page with upgradable modules for customization, catering to specific niches like fitness influencers or runners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Such a platform could also support monetization through affiliate links for products like supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

There's also a need for platforms that help manage "lead magnets" on personal webpages to capture email addresses, especially given algorithm changes on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. People are more willing to provide their email for valuable content rather than a general newsletter subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Centralized Health Platforms with AI
There is a significant need for a centralized platform that integrates various personal health data, such as continuous glucose monitor (CGM) readings, Strava data, blood work results (e.g., from Function Health), and medication information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

Such a platform could triangulate information and offer suggestions, potentially through a [[chatgpt40_and_its_applications | ChatGPT]]-like interface, to help users understand complex health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

> "In theory, a doctor should have the wholesale understanding of what is happening in your body, but it doesn't. Right. In theory, the doctor should be the data warehouse. And there should be an AI layer that you can ask it based on the data." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>

This application could also incorporate web information in real-time, making it more effective than a traditional doctor for certain types of analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Many existing health products, like the Oura Ring, provide data but often lack actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Users would likely pay substantially more than typical subscription fees for such a comprehensive, actionable health tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. It could also be offered as a perk to employees by companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

Such a platform could also act as an ongoing health assistant, helping users build habits (e.g., reminding them to drink water) or address specific issues like posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

## Directories as Custom GPTs
Many sizable companies in the past were built as "directory companies" that aggregated digitized information, like Nomad List for cities for digital nomads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

Now, existing directories can be enhanced or transformed into "custom GPTs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. A custom GPT would allow users to chat with it, specifying unique preferences (e.g., "good weather," "less than a thousand dollars per month," "visa requirements") to get personalized recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

> "Are you seeing people make money through custom GPTs? Not yet." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>

One example of monetization seen is a lawyer using top legal GPTs as a lead generation tool, connecting with people seeking legal contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. For a custom GPT to monetize, it needs to leverage specialized data that is not readily available through general [[chatgpt40_and_its_applications | ChatGPT]] or Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. If it's uniquely effective for a specific set of needs, monetization through ads, affiliates, or lead generation is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.

## AI-Powered Dating Apps
Current dating apps are primarily based on looks and swiping, despite people valuing humor and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. AI presents an opportunity to create better dating apps that prioritize compatibility traits beyond appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

An idea proposed is a dating app where users swipe on memes instead of faces to gauge humor and then get matched based on compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. The future of dating might involve removing swiping altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

An [[ai_applications_for_automating_tasks | AI]] could act as a personalized matchmaker, integrating information from various apps like Goodreads, Netflix, or Strava to understand user interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. If everyone had an "open page," it could serve as a perfect mechanism for initial compatibility identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. This AI could even arrange blind dates, picking times and locations, reducing the typical complexities of dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

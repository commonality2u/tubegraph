Viral TikTok formats and templates represent a significant opportunity for businesses seeking to leverage online trends for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. People are actively searching for these formats, with "TikTok template" alone garnering 98,000 searches in a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.

## The Opportunity

The core opportunity lies in identifying and disseminating the TikTok formats and templates that are currently going viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

For example, a mobile app was able to achieve 100,000 downloads on the App Store in approximately 15 days by effectively using TikTok for [[strategies_for_organic_growth_of_consumer_apps_using_tiktok|organic growth of consumer apps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

## Business Idea: Viral Format Newsletter

A viable business model involves creating an email newsletter that curates and distributes these viral TikTok formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.

### Concept

The newsletter would inform subscribers about "the formats that are going viral this week on TikTok and here's how you can go and use these for your brand right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.

This concept is inspired by Jason Levan's Memelord Technologies, which offers a daily email newsletter of viral [[converting_longform_content_to_memes|meme templates]] that users can instantly jump into an editor to create their own versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. A similar approach could be applied to TikTok templates, allowing users to easily adapt and produce their own content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.

The initial step would be the newsletter, which could then evolve into a full video editor specifically for TikTok, potentially including a social scheduling application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

### Monetization

The email list can be monetized in various ways, including offering a paid version of the newsletter (e.g., daily updates for paid subscribers versus weekly for free subscribers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

### Acquisition Strategy

Initial customer acquisition could involve:
*   **Twitter Threads:** Creating threads like "Here's the five formats that are going viral on TikTok this week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. These threads would break down each format and conclude with a call to action to join the email newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. This strategy is an effective way for [[developing_content_formats_for_audience_growth|developing content formats for audience growth]].
*   **Content Mix Analysis:** Showcasing the content mix and formats that successful apps or brands are using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.

## General Principles for Content & Growth

*   **Identify Trends:** The data for identifying trends is publicly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>.
*   **Agnosticism to What Works:** Founders should be agnostic to their personal opinions on what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>. The role is to try many things, identify what performs best, and then follow that data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.
*   **Platform Specificity:** Content formats that work on one channel may not work on another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>. It's crucial to understand and adapt to the specific "game" of each platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>. For example, specific [[linkedin_video_content_strategies|LinkedIn video content strategies]] have been identified that differ from other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>.
*   **Constant Reinvention:** Maintaining audience engagement requires being open to switching up formats and constantly reinventing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.

The ability to create a YouTube channel is described as something worth paying $13,000 a month for due to its capability to attract people interested in the same topics, enabling the creation and sale of products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. This "owned media" approach provides the "rails" to publish any content desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

*   **Long-form Video** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>
*   **Podcasting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>
*   **Short-form Video** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>
*   **Monetization** – YouTube's [[Monetization and revenue on YouTube | monetization]] features, particularly its high RPMs (revenue per mille), are a primary reason creators migrate to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.

*   **Views**: 263,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>

## Content and [[youtube_growth_strategies | Growth Strategies]] for YouTube
### Thumbnails and Titles
*   **Importance**: Both titles and thumbnails are equally important for video performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Approach**: Utilizing tools like VidIQ can provide data on what titles and thumbnails are performing well, allowing creators to make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Trend Analysis**: YouTube thumbnail and title combinations have a shelf life, similar to trends on other social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. Creators need to constantly cycle through formats to avoid audience fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.

### Leveraging Existing Audiences
Companies and individuals with existing audiences on platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn can convert those followers into newsletter subscribers using scraping tools and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. This strategy focuses on building an "owned distribution channel" to foster deeper relationships with followers and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

## YouTube as a Foundation for Other Businesses
The revenue and audience from a YouTube channel can serve as a subsidy or lead generation for other businesses:
*   **Productized Services/SaaS** – YouTube income can be used to fund the development of productized services and SaaS companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Real Estate** – Building a large YouTube audience creates "digital gravity" and "digital mass" on the internet, offering leverage and distribution across all social channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>. This audience can then be cross-promoted and utilized for other ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>.
*   **Niche Opportunities** – Even highly niched content, such as digital out-of-home advertising, can lead to significant success and income if it attracts a dedicated audience with high buying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

### The "Creator" Mindset
More and more founders are aspiring to be YouTubers, recognizing the value of building a personal brand and audience on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. This shift indicates a broader acceptance of creators as key business figures. The key to consistency in content creation is finding a sustainable rhythm and leveraging teams to handle operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

Beehiiv is a platform designed to simplify the process of building and monetizing email-based businesses, aiming to help creators scale from zero to significant subscriber numbers and monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Tyler Denk, co-founder of Beehiiv and formerly instrumental in Morning Brew's growth, channeled his expertise into creating the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## All-in-One Solution
Beehiiv offers an all-in-one solution for newsletter creation and management, eliminating the need for multiple platforms for website building, automations, and newsletter hosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This integration allows for comprehensive data tracking, including subscriber acquisition sources (e.g., X, LinkedIn) and on-site behavior, which is crucial for understanding readers and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## Website Builder
Beehiiv includes a full website builder that allows for fully customizable websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Users can:
*   Create and spin up different custom web pages, including subscribe pages and archive pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   Customize elements like text size, color, and subtitles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   Host both email newsletters and web articles on the same platform, with built-in SEO optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## Email Capture and Sign-up Flows
To facilitate subscriber acquisition, Beehiiv offers several email capture features:
*   **Email Capture Pop-ups:** Customizable pop-ups can be dropped onto specific pages, with options to control timing, display pages, and even vary based on traffic source (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Custom Sign-up Flows:** After a user enters their email, a custom sign-up flow can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This flow can include:
    *   Recommendation models for other newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
    *   Surveys to collect additional subscriber data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
    *   A final destination thank you page that introduces the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Different sign-up forms and pop-ups can direct users to different custom sign-up flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## Automations
Beehiiv supports automated email journeys, ranging from simple welcome emails to multi-step sequences with custom logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Welcome Series Automation:** Users can set up automated welcome series to be sent immediately after someone signs up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This is an opportunity to:
    *   Introduce the newsletter and its content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
    *   Incentivize actions, such as referring others to the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
    *   Build instant trust and humanize the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
    *   Increase Lifetime Value (LTV) by offering products or services (e.g., courses, one-on-one time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Conditional Automations:** Automations can include true/false branches based on subscriber actions, such as whether they completed a survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. This allows for targeted follow-up emails to re-engage subscribers who skipped steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

## Data Collection and Surveys
Beehiiv features a native survey builder to collect valuable demographic and preference data from new subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   Surveys can collect information like first name, birthday (for basic demographic data), primary role (founder, freelancer), and skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   This data helps publishers understand their audience, dictate content creation (e.g., focusing on founder-related content if 60% of subscribers are founders), and inform monetization strategies for advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   The data collected through surveys can be used in media kits to attract sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

## Growth and Acquisition Tools
Beehiiv provides multiple tools to grow a newsletter's subscriber base:
*   **Recommendation Network:** Publishers can organically recommend other newsletters within the Beehiiv ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. This fosters network effects, allowing newsletters to gain subscribers passively from others in the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.
*   **Boost Network:** This is a two-sided marketplace for paid subscriber acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.
    *   **Monetization for Publishers:** Newsletters can earn money by promoting other newsletters to their new subscribers during the sign-up flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>. Payments are typically on a cost-per-acquisition (CPA) basis (e.g., $2-4 per lead) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.
    *   **Acquisition for Publishers:** Publishers can set a budget to acquire subscribers from other newsletters in the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. Beehiiv's system ensures payment only for engaged subscribers by verifying open rates and other engagement metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.
    *   **Automated Management:** Features like "auto-pause" allow publishers to set thresholds (e.g., 30% open rate) for incoming subscribers, automatically stopping campaigns with underperforming channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. Publishers can also filter and auto-accept applications from other newsletters based on criteria like language, geography, engagement, and "boost quality" scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.
*   **Lead Magnets:** Users can create custom landing pages on the Beehiiv website builder to serve as [[building_simple_and_effective_marketing_workflows | lead magnets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. These digital assets (e.g., a seed deck) can be offered in exchange for an email address, with a custom sign-up flow and automation to deliver the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This strategy helps attract highly relevant subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.
*   **Referral Program:** Beehiiv has a native referral program that allows publishers to incentivize existing readers to share their newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.
    *   **Rewards:** Publishers can set up various rewards (e.g., digital goods like exclusive PDFs, or physical merchandise with promo codes) for referring new subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. Rewards can be low-cost or free to the publisher, such as digital downloads or discounts on drop-shipped merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
    *   **Automation:** The system automates the fulfillment of rewards once a subscriber hits a referral milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
    *   **In-Email Tracking:** A unique referral code and progress tracker can be embedded directly into the newsletter, allowing readers to easily share and monitor their referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.
*   **Email Gating on Content:** Publishers can choose to "gate" their web content, requiring visitors to subscribe to read the full post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. This transforms every published article into a constant [[building_simple_and_effective_marketing_workflows | lead magnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.

## Monetization Tools
Beehiiv offers diverse monetization options for newsletters:
*   **Sponsorship Storefront:** Publishers can set up a public storefront on their Beehiiv website where advertisers can view stats, check available inventory, and directly book ad placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.
    *   Beehiiv takes a low, flat transaction fee ($10) for direct bookings, rather than a percentage of revenue, allowing publishers to keep more of their earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.
    *   The system integrates with an ad calendar, sends notifications, and allows for one-click insertion of ad assets into newsletters with automated reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.
*   **Paid Subscriptions:** Publishers can charge readers for content or community access on a monthly or annual basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>.
    *   Beehiiv does not take a cut of subscription revenue (only Stripe's processing fees apply) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>.
    *   Features include free trials, discounts, and dashboards for managing subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.
    *   Automations can be set up to integrate with external platforms (e.g., Slack, Discord) to add paid subscribers to exclusive communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   **Beehiiv Ad Network:** Publishers can opt into Beehiiv's internal ad network, which provisions ads from major brands (e.g., Netflix, Nike, HubSpot) to suitable newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
    *   Publishers are typically paid per click (e.g., $3-4 per click) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.
    *   The process is highly automated; publishers select ad copy and run dates, and Beehiiv handles placement and payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>.

## Beehiiv Affiliate Program

A "wedge product" is a crucial strategy for [[building_a_vertical_saas_business | Vertical SaaS]] companies looking to enter an industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. It serves as the initial "get in the door" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

## Why Use a Wedge Product?

The ultimate goal for a [[building_a_vertical_saas_business | Vertical SaaS]] business is often to become the all-in-one, "One-Stop Shop" solution or the "source of record" for an industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. However, attempting to build and launch an all-encompassing solution from the outset is typically unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. Such an endeavor would require years of development and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>, leading to a shallow product that doesn't excel in any area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

A wedge product allows a company to gain initial traction and build trust within an industry before expanding its offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

## Characteristics of an Effective Wedge Product

An effective wedge product targets an area where:
*   The current processes are inefficient, often still reliant on pen and paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   Existing competition is poor or fragmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.
*   The problem it solves is highly important to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.
*   It offers a creative solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.
*   It is easy to implement and deploy quickly, avoiding lengthy 12-month implementation cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>.
*   It serves as a "reputation prover," demonstrating value and building credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

## Case Study: Roofer.com

Roofer.com provides a compelling example of a successful wedge product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. Rather than attempting to build an all-in-one software for the roofing industry, they focused on a specific, critical pain point: proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

Their wedge product was a proposal tool that leveraged Google Maps to assess roofs and generate real-time quotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. This tool addressed the common awkwardness and inefficiency of manual, on-site estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

Key aspects of Roofer.com's wedge product:
*   **Free to Use:** The product was free for roofing companies, with Roofer.com taking a percentage of the booking once a proposal was accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>. This means no money out of the roofing company's pocket upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.
*   **Digital Acquisition:** It allowed them to acquire roofing companies via digital marketing (Instagram, Facebook ads), which is uncommon in home services industries typically dominated by heavy sales-led approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.
*   **Reputation and Trust Building:** By helping roofing companies close business through efficient proposals, Roofer.com became a "hero," increasing trust with their customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.
*   **Expansion:** After establishing their reputation with the proposal tool, they expanded into other essential features like a CRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>, gradually moving towards an all-in-one solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.

## Capturing the Transaction with Payments

A strategic benefit of a wedge product is its potential to lead to owning the financial transaction within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>. Integrating payments into a [[building_a_vertical_saas_business | Vertical SaaS]] solution can significantly increase a company's market size and valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.

Many large, industry-specific software companies own the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. For example, Toast, a restaurant software company, vastly increased its market size by taking a percentage of every transaction that flowed through its system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. By building a wedge product that positions the SaaS company either before or after a core business transaction, it becomes easier to eventually capture that transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.

## [[pricing_strategies_for_vertical_saas | Pricing Strategies]] for Wedge Products

[[pricing_strategies_for_vertical_saas | Pricing]] in software is often an afterthought, but it should be a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. For a wedge product, a key approach is to understand the monetary value of the problem being solved for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.

For example, a retention tool for trade schools that saves students from dropping out directly impacts tuition revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. If a solution can save five students each paying $20,000 in tuition, that translates to $100,000 in saved revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>. This allows the product to be priced high, demonstrating a clear Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

The aim is to charge less than the ROI provided, perhaps starting at 50% of the value created, and then adjusting based on market feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>. It's crucial to build products that directly increase revenue, decrease costs, prevent customer churn, or ensure compliance, as these areas offer clear and quantifiable ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.

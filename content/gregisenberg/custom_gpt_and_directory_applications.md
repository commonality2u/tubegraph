The digital landscape has seen a significant evolution in how information is accessed and utilized, particularly with the advent of AI and custom GPTs.

## The Rise of Directories
Five to ten years ago, there was a substantial wave of directory creation on the internet, spurred by the digitization of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. Companies like Nomad List emerged by aggregating existing data to help users make sense of which cities digital nomads should visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Many directory companies grew to become quite sizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.

## Enhancing Directories with Custom GPTs
A key idea for leveraging current AI capabilities is to transform existing directory companies or websites into custom GPTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

For instance, while Nomad List is useful, a more advanced solution would be a custom GPT where users could interact conversationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. Users could specify their preferences, such as prioritizing good weather or needing a location that costs less than $1,000 per month, and inquire about visa requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This approach leverages the power of AI to provide personalized recommendations, making the directory experience much more dynamic and tailored to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies for Custom GPTs
The question of whether people are generating revenue through custom GPTs is emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. One reported instance involves a lawyer who acquired top legal GPTs and used them for lead generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. When users prompt for legal advice or contracts, the lawyer reaches out to offer professional services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

For a custom GPT to be monetizable, it generally needs to possess specialized data that isn't readily available through general AI models like ChatGPT or Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. If the custom GPT is uniquely effective at addressing specific user needs, it presents a strong case for monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.

Creators traditionally monetize through various methods including ads, affiliate partnerships, or by selling their own products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. The lead generation mechanism, as demonstrated by the lawyer, is also considered a highly interesting and effective avenue for many topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

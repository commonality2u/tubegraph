Creating [[productized_services_for_agencies | productized services]] and SaaS (Software as a Service) companies is becoming a prevalent and interesting new business model, especially for a younger generation who are leveraging platforms like YouTube to generate income and subsidize these ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This approach is changing the dynamic of how businesses function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The Foundation of Owned Media

Owning media channels like a YouTube channel or a podcast provides the "rails" to distribute any content or product, essentially allowing one to operate at a "pro level" in the current business landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This strategy enables creators to attract an audience interested in similar topics, allowing them to create and sell products and services without being tied to specific geographic locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It creates "owned distribution" and fosters deep trust in a one-to-many format, generating inbound opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.

A key benefit of building an audience is reaching a scale where the rules of the game change, enabling cross-promotion across social channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. This "digital gravity" or "digital mass" attracts serendipitous opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

### YouTube as a Revenue Engine
YouTube is noted for its powerful monetization through RPMs (revenue per mille) and its ability to attract creators from other platforms due to its financial benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. For example, one individual's YouTube channel generated an estimated $3,000 revenue from 263,000 views and 31,000 hours of watch time in 30 days, subsidizing the cost of building the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>. This level of income can justify paying significant monthly fees for assistance, as it attracts an interested audience for product and service sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>.

## Productized Service and SaaS Ideas

### 1. AI-Powered Cricut SVG Collections
An example of a successful venture spun up in 72 hours, using off-the-shelf tools like Shopify and its apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **Concept**: A subscription-based service providing AI-generated SVG (scalable vector graphics) files for Cricut users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   **Technology**: Utilizes AI tools like Midjourney for image creation (prompting for black and white, white background images) and AI vectorizing tools to turn images into SVG files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   **Pricing Strategy**: A freemium model where users sign up with their email for free downloads, and premium content requires a paid subscription, e.g., $3.99 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: Runs Facebook ads with 50-cent emails, using a drip nurture sequence to upsell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity**: Taps into the 10 million Cricut users, leveraging an existing massive company as a "barnacle on the whale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

### 2. LinkedIn Video Content Service for Founders
This [[productized_services_for_agencies | productized service]] capitalizes on LinkedIn's new "for you page" feed, similar to TikTok, which offers a "blue ocean" for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **Concept**: An agency that helps founders create vertical video content for LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.
*   **Process**:
    1.  Interview a founder for an hour weekly to generate ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
    2.  Write scripts based on the conversation, showing inflection and pacing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
    3.  Founder records the videos (takes about 10 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
    4.  Agency creates clips, schedules, and handles data analytics to optimize performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.
*   **Pricing**: Starts around $2,500 a month, with upsells for lead magnets as a service ($5-8k/month) and design help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.
*   **Distribution**: Founders can promote the service on their own LinkedIn channels, inviting interested users to an intro call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. A community for founders seeking to grow on LinkedIn can serve as a drip nurture into the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. For example, "FoundersGoingViralOnLinkedIn.com" could offer weekly tips, breakdowns of successful founder content, and monthly peer-to-peer calls, with the service offered as a done-for-you solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity**: Founders desire massive personal brands with free reach on LinkedIn, leading to inbound generation for their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. This is a current trend that can be ridden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

### 3. AI Automation Engineering for SMBs
This addresses the growing search volume for "AI automation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>.
*   **Concept**: Provide AI automation services for small and medium businesses (SMBs), similar to what large firms like McKinsey do for enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.
*   **Service Model**:
    *   Consulting company: Embed with clients for a sprint (e.g., 3 months) to automate business processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>.
    *   [[productized_services_for_agencies | Productized service]]: Offer an embedded AI automation engineer who automates various parts of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>.
*   **Pricing**: Can charge around $8,000 a month, as cost savings for clients are instant, especially by automating "paper pushing" tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. The value proposition is clear: saving significant costs for clients, e.g., if you save a client $200,000, you can charge $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>.
*   **Distribution**:
    *   Become a thought leader in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>.
    *   Bid on keywords like "AI automation" and terms related to automation tools (Make.com, Zapier, ChatGPT APIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:16]</a>.
    *   Create tutorials using AI (e.g., Perplexity AI) for common setups, with a call to action for consulting services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.
    *   Develop a YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.

### 4. Newsletter Writing Service for Founders
*   **Concept**: A done-for-you service that writes newsletters for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>. This can be an additional offering to the LinkedIn video content service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:41:00">[29:41:00]</a>.
*   **Process**:
    1.  Interview the founder for an hour, recording the session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:46:00">[29:46:00]</a>.
    2.  Transcribe the interview and use AI to transform the raw data into newsletter content, maintaining the founder's tone, style, and voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a>.
*   **Growth Strategy**:
    *   Target founders who already have a following on platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:00">[29:54:00]</a>.
    *   Scrape email addresses from their followers (e.g., Twitter followers or LinkedIn connections using tools like SalesQL), validate them, and sequence them into the newsletter (e.g., 200 per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:34:00">[30:34:00]</a>.
    *   Automate lead generation: Use tools like Phantom Buster to automatically send "subscribe to my newsletter" links via DMs to new LinkedIn connections or Twitter followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:00]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition**: Offers "schmuck insurance" against platform dependency by helping founders build their own email lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:52:00">[33:52:00]</a>. Founders view this as a return on audience spend (ROAS), justifying costs by the lifetime value of a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:21:00">[33:21:00]</a>.

### 5. AI Graphic Designer SaaS
*   **Concept**: A SaaS tool that generates graphics (e.g., podcast thumbnails, email headers, Facebook ads) based on a user's brand style guide (colors, logos, fonts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:07:00">[23:07:00]</a>.
*   **Need**: There isn't currently a good solution that delivers high-quality, on-brand designs, unlike existing tools that often produce generic or poorly designed outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:38:00">[23:38:00]</a>. The goal is to provide "good enough" designs that can then be refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>.
*   **Functionality**: Acts as a co-pilot, taking text and background images to create variations of designs while adhering to brand guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:00">[25:34:00]</a>. It leverages the concept that providing "awesome source material" and constraints to AI models leads to better outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:00">[28:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>.
*   **Pricing**: A potential [[pricing_strategies_for_saas_products | pricing strategy]] could be $99 a month, significantly undercutting existing services like Design Pickle (which charges $499/month) by leveraging AI for efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>. It could offer multi-threading (working on multiple prompts simultaneously) unlike some competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:10]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity**: Despite large players like Canva moving into AI, there will always be demand for quick, on-brand asset creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>. This represents an opportunity to "ride the AI wave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:18:00">[29:18:00]</a>.

### 6. YouTube Thumbnail/Title Library SaaS
*   **Concept**: A subscription service offering a library of YouTube thumbnails and titles, with data on their performance (impressions, views) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:05:00">[39:05:00]</a>.
*   **Functionality**: Allows users to find effective thumbnail/title combinations, swap out assets (e.g., faces), and understand trends and "shelf life" of different formats to combat audience fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:01:00">[37:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:08:00">[40:08:00]</a>. Could integrate with tools like VidIQ for data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:27:00">[39:27:00]</a>.
*   **Distribution**:
    *   Cold email YouTubers: Scrape email addresses of YouTubers (e.g., over 10,000 subscribers, specific categories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:13:00">[37:13:00]</a>.
    *   Offer a free trial (e.g., access to 10 thumbnails) before a paid tier for full access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:42:00">[37:42:00]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity**: Leverages the "Money Twitter" phenomenon where younger generations monetize YouTube content and use it to build businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>. YouTube's dominance in long-form, short-form, podcasting, and monetization positions it as the winning social media platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:24:00">[38:24:00]</a>. More founders are aspiring to be YouTubers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>.

### 7. Canva Video Captions App
*   **Concept**: Build an application or plugin for Canva that provides high-quality video captions, including transcription and styling options (fonts, karaoke effects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:17:00">[50:17:00]</a>.
*   **Need**: Canva, despite being a fast-growing video editor, lacks good video captioning functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:17:00">[50:17:00]</a>. Other tools like "Vee" have this, indicating existing demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:33:00">[51:33:00]</a>.
*   **Technology**: Utilize a large whisper model for transcription and integrate with Canva's existing font styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:57:00">[50:57:00]</a>.
*   **Distribution**: Leverage Canva's app ecosystem and user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:13:00">[51:13:00]</a>.
*   **Potential Outcome**: Could become a $20K/month company or larger, potentially leading to an acquisition by Canva to integrate the feature natively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:11:00">[51:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:47:00">[51:47:00]</a>. Gaining PR and traction (e.g., $20K/month revenue) would make it attractive for acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:13:00">[52:13:00]</a>.

### 8. Niche Cheap Flight Newsletter
*   **Concept**: Revive the "Scott's Cheap Flights" idea by creating a specialized newsletter aggregating cheap flight deals from Google Flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:54:00">[52:54:00]</a>.
*   **Process**:
    1.  Set up Google Flights alerts for various cities (e.g., major US metros) to receive email notifications when prices drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:28:00">[53:28:00]</a>.
    2.  Aggregate these alerts into a newsletter, potentially automated with a tool like Zapier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:21:00">[54:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:46:00">[54:46:00]</a>.
    3.  Monetize via subscription and affiliate programs (e.g., Kiwi.com for kickbacks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:32:00">[54:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:37:00">[54:37:00]</a>.
*   **Distribution**:
    *   Target "frequent traveler" interest groups on Facebook with ads (e.g., "Find cheap flights from Denver to anywhere") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:03:00">[54:03:00]</a>.
    *   Rely on organic growth through email forwarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity**: Scott's Cheap Flights (now "Going.com") has lost its soul, creating a vacuum for a more niche and soulful service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:23:00">[55:23:00]</a>. Could clone existing successful models, even those with outdated websites that still boast millions of subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:29:00">[56:29:00]</a>. Travel-related businesses typically have high CPMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:58:00">[58:58:00]</a>. Can expand to "what's happening in my city" newsletters to retain users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:13:00">[59:13:00]</a>.

### 9. [[building_a_successful_vertical_saas_business | Vertical SaaS]] for Accounting (QuickBooks for X)
*   **Concept**: Develop specialized accounting software and services tailored for specific industries, taking a broad solution like QuickBooks and niching it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.
*   **Examples**: "QuickBooks for SaaS," "QuickBooks for Agencies," "QuickBooks for Real Estate," or "QuickBooks for Airbnb entrepreneurs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.
*   **Market Research**:
    *   Examine QuickBooks extensions to identify industries and categories that frequently integrate with it, looking for the largest categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
    *   Prompt ChatGPT for category ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>.
    *   Conduct [[competitive_analysis_in_saas_development | competitive analysis]] to avoid highly saturated markets (e.g., avoiding internet businesses with high competition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Look for a larger trend or platform where businesses are being built on top, then create a custom accounting solution for that specific niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. An example given is like EHRs (Electronic Health Records) specializing for different practitioner types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.
*   **Distribution**: Cold email businesses within the target niche (e.g., Shopify owners for a D2C accounting solution), highlighting the custom integration and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>.

## General Strategies for Building Productized Services and SaaS

*   **Ride the Wave**: Identify and attach to larger trends, platforms, or "waves" instead of trying to educate the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Sell what people already want to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping Playbook**: Looking for large trends and attaching to them is the "only way to do it" when bootstrapping or self-funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.
*   **Founder's Role**: In the early days, "founder energy" is crucial to break barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Once the company is established, the goal is to step back from operations as much as possible, acting as an "editor" or "conductor" rather than playing every instrument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Distribution**: An idea is only "junk food" unless there's a strong execution and distribution strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Tactical distribution methods are key, such as using tools like Apollo to scrape emails, validating them with ZeroBounce, and running cold email campaigns via Smartlead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.
*   **Monetization**:
    *   **[[pricing_strategies_for_saas_products | Value-based pricing]]**: Charge based on the cost savings or value provided to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>.
    *   **Subscription Models**: Common for SaaS and productized services, providing recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Affiliate Programs**: Leverage kickbacks from integrated services (e.g., Kiwi.com for flights) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   **Founder as Media Company**: Founders are increasingly becoming media companies themselves, building audiences that generate inbound leads and deeper relationships with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48">[01:14:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>. This also opens doors for selling to VCs who want their portfolio companies to have a media presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   **Underserved Niches**: Look for "unsexy" industries or areas where there is "blue ocean" (low competition) in content creation and business building. Even small, niche audiences can have significant buying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:43">[01:44:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:52">[01:57:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Authenticity**: Being authentic and discussing topics you genuinely want to talk about helps build a loyal audience, even if deemed "too niche" by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning**: Engaging in conversations with other founders and practitioners provides "at bats" to gain more perspective and synthesize ideas, which can then be applied to one's own ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. This process of publicly sharing insights, even if it feels like "junk food," creates leverage and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.

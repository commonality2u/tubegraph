From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Composing software applications refers to the process of guiding AI tools to build software without extensive coding knowledge. It's described as "speaking English" and having the code come out, acting as a guide or composer rather than a traditional coder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. This approach aims to democratize app development, making it accessible to those who previously found traditional coding too complex or time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Shift in App Development

It has become significantly easier to create websites and apps, with tools enabling the creation of complex applications like Notion, complete with database storage, using AI and without writing a single line of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This process can take as little as six or seven hours to create a functional app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The core idea is that users can "remix" existing apps, adding desired features by describing them to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The ability to create a working app is "guaranteed" for those with "high agency" who persist through errors by continually asking AI for solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Key Tools and Platforms

Several [[tools_and_platforms_for_ai_app_development | tools and platforms for AI app development]] facilitate software composition:

*   **v0:** This tool focuses on [[creating_frontend_interfaces_without_coding | creating frontend interfaces without coding]] using Next.js <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. It allows users to generate slick designs with subtle animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> and make live changes by describing desired alterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. v0 provides pre-downloaded libraries, simplifying the initial setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Cursor:** Hailed as a highly hyped tool, Cursor is an editor that allows users to edit multiple pages at once using a "composer" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. It is considered "the best software" the speaker has ever used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
*   **Replit:** This platform is used to run and deploy front-end applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. It simplifies taking a created app and putting it on the internet with a sharable domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.
*   **Firebase:** Offers free database storage and authentication services up to a certain user threshold, making it a cost-effective backend solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.
*   **OpenAI/Anthropic APIs:** These provide the underlying AI capabilities for tasks like analyzing transcripts and generating structured outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

## The Composing Process

[[prototyping_and_app_development_for_nonengineers | Prototyping and app development for nonengineers]] and [[building_ai_applications_without_extensive_coding_knowledge | building AI applications without extensive coding knowledge]] follows an iterative, problem-solving approach:

1.  **Initial Front-End Design (v0):**
    *   Start by defining the layout and necessary elements for the user interface, such as fields for "idea," "market description," and "internet audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   Prompt v0 to generate a "presentation card" or "slide" with a slick design and subtle animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   Iterate on design elements like adding borders, specific background patterns (e.g., light dots like graph paper), and adjusting prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   Integrate interactive features, such as a "sip or spit" evaluation slider with corresponding color changes and animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This demonstrates [[creating_user_interfaces_and_features_in_apps | creating user interfaces and features in apps]].
    *   When making changes, it's crucial to give the AI context and purpose for new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

2.  **Connecting Backend and Adding AI Features (Replit, Cursor, APIs):**
    *   Use a pre-configured Next.js template in Replit that includes backend and database storage (Firebase) and authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
    *   Connect Cursor to Replit using SSH keys to facilitate code editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
    *   In Cursor, define the AI's task, such as creating a chatbot where a user inputs a startup idea, and the AI outputs the idea in a specific format (e.g., idea, market, internet audiences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. This highlights [[building_apps_using_ai_tools | building apps using AI tools]].
    *   Install necessary libraries (e.g., `npm install open AI Edge`) using Replit's shell when prompted by Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

3.  **Debugging and Iteration:**
    *   Expect and embrace errors, as they are a natural part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
    *   When an app isn't working, explicitly ask the AI to "add error logs" to identify the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.
    *   Use external tools like Perplexity to find the latest API documentation for specific use cases (e.g., for analyzing transcripts and structured output) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>. This updated documentation can then be fed to Cursor to help it write better code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
    *   Be persistent: "odds are by the second or third try like you will will your way to a working app" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Sometimes, a direct plea to the AI like "please make this work" can be surprisingly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Screenshotting existing apps or designs you like and then describing desired changes to the AI can lead to quick prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

## Benefits and Philosophy

*   **Cost-Effective:** Hosting a website can be very cheap, with services like Replit and Firebase making it possible to get an Minimum Viable Product (MVP) up for around $20 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. This is significantly cheaper than hiring a front-end designer, whose hourly rates can be hundreds of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.
*   **High Agency:** The process empowers individuals to take charge of their ideas, removing the need for external experts or influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solving:** Engaging with AI in this manner enhances problem-solving skills, similar to learning any other craft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Developing Taste:** Actively [[designing_ui_for_saas_applications | designing UI for SaaS applications]] and interacting with websites helps in developing a critical eye for good design, often noticing subtle elements that enhance user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Allows for the quick creation of functional prototypes in minutes, even if they don't store data yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

## Community and Future

A community called "Software Composers" is being built to help a million people learn to "compose" software without writing traditional code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. This initiative plans to offer in-depth courses, weekly calls, and assistance with projects, aiming to help every member create and deploy an app, including managing monetization with Stripe integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>. The philosophy emphasizes getting hands-on and treating the process as a creative endeavor, even if not every project turns into a large business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>.

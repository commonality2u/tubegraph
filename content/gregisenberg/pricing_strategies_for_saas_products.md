Pricing is often the least considered aspect of software development, despite its critical importance for business success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>. A fundamental approach to pricing involves understanding the financial impact a solution has on the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>.

## Core Pricing Framework

The primary strategy for pricing SaaS products is to understand the cost or pain points a solution addresses for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>. By quantifying the value saved or generated, a pricing model can then be developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>.

### Example: Student Retention Tool

In the context of trade schools, a significant problem was student retention, with many students dropping out of programs, leading to substantial financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>.

1.  **Problem Identification**: Students dropping out, leading to lost tuition revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.
2.  **Solution Developed**: A tool was created to analyze academic and attendance data, generate a real-time risk score for at-risk students, and automatically text them with motivational messages and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>.
3.  **Quantifying the Problem's Cost**:
    *   Average tuition per student: $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.
    *   Typical retention rate: 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.
    *   Schools were losing millions annually due to this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.
4.  **Quantifying Value Delivered**: Saving even five students who were halfway through their program, each paying $20,000, represented a significant financial impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.
5.  **Value-Based Pricing**:
    *   The product can be priced high by forecasting the number of students saved and translating that into tangible revenue for the school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
    *   The average lift in retention rate was calculated to be 3% based on customer data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.
    *   The price is set to be less than the calculated ROI, often around 50% of the value generated for the customer, with adjustments made based on market feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.

### Key Factors for Value-Based Pricing

Products that lend themselves well to this pricing model are those that demonstrably:
*   Increase revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>
*   Decrease costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>
*   Prevent customer churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>
*   Maintain compliance (for regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>

These areas allow for clear and quantifiable Return on Investment (ROI), which is crucial for justifying the product's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>. If a product doesn't achieve one of these outcomes, it is unlikely to be prioritized or purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.

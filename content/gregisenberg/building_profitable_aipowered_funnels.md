Niels, CEO of Perspective, a funnel-building software, shares insights on how to build and scale profitable businesses using AI-powered funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His company spends $250,000 a month to drive traffic to funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The episode aims to demystify funnels and how they can be leveraged for significant business growth, especially with the integration of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Power of Productized AI-Powered Funnels

Niels highlights a unique opportunity to [[Building competitive AI businesses | build competitive AI businesses]] through very productized services, blurring the line between product and service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. With [[Using AI tools for business growth | AI tools]] like Perspective, a single founder can potentially create a side business generating $400,000-$500,000 a month with 80% profit, supported by only one or two freelancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Perspective's active customer base includes hundreds of agencies generating $10,000 to $100,000 a month by running funnels as a productized service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Some have even scaled to over a million dollars per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Perspective itself has scaled to over $10 million in ARR primarily through funnels and paid performance marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Key Strategies for Building Profitable Funnels

The most successful agencies focus on specific niches and offer business-critical results to ensure low churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This approach allows for a "build once, sell twice" model, especially with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Common successful niches and services include:
*   **Industry Focus:** Agencies typically choose one industry that is not "techy," meaning clients prefer to outsource marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Examples include insurance, manufacturing, law, medical, and solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Business-Critical Results:** The two predominant services across Perspective's customer base are recruiting and [[Using AI for lead generation | lead generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For instance, an agency specializing in recruiting for bakeries does almost a million dollars a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Another agency, with over 50 people, focuses on [[Using AI for lead generation | lead generation]] for lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### The Funnel Building Process

Agencies using Perspective follow a structured approach:

1.  **Client Onboarding Funnel**: Initially, an agency might use a funnel (often a survey) to onboard new clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
2.  **Figure Out One Killer Funnel Concept**: The core is to identify one offer and funnel type that consistently works for a specific industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The lawyer agency, for example, perfected a quiz funnel approach for generating claimants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
3.  **Optimize and Build the Service**:
    *   **AI for Copy**: [[Using AI to optimize funnel performance | GPT]] can generate new copy based on onboarding surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   **Automated Operations**: The entire back-end operations, including invoicing and CRM updates, can be outsourced to [[Using AI to optimize funnel performance | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
    *   **Ad Creatives**: [[Using AI to optimize funnel performance | GPT]] can also generate ad creatives, though quality may vary for lead generation businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
    *   **Templates**: Implement the funnel template, emails, and ads with AI-generated copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Static ads are recommended for their lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Why Perspective Funnels Drive Higher Conversions

Perspective is designed to create a "delightful experience" and prioritize speed, addressing common issues with traditional websites and funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

*   **Speed**: Funnels built with Perspective are optimized for speed, loading quickly regardless of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Pages loading faster than 1 second can convert up to 2.5 times more than those loading longer than 5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Interactivity (Quiz Elements)**: Many successful Perspective templates incorporate quiz elements to make the experience fun and engaging, similar to social media feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   **Mobile-First Design**: Perspective prioritizes mobile canvas building, recognizing that 95% of paid social traffic comes from mobile devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.
*   **Personalization**: Funnels use personalization to match ad headlines with funnel content via variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. This ensures consistency and is proven to boost conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. Based on quiz answers, different Video Sales Letters (VSSLs) or offers can be shown, directly addressing the user's pain points or desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **Lead Qualification**: Quiz questions not only aid conversion but also qualify leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Only qualified leads are sent back to ad platforms (e.g., Meta) for algorithm optimization, ensuring ads are shown to the right audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   **Integrated AB Testing**: Perspective simplifies AB testing without slowing down the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. Users can duplicate pages, make adjustments, publish, and automatically split traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. The system suggests statistical significance, allowing for quick iteration and optimization with AI-generated B variants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>.

### Crafting Engaging Video Sales Letters (VSSLs)

For VSSLs, Niels emphasizes a focus on the following:
1.  **Hook**: The first 5 seconds are crucial to capture attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
2.  **Education/Value**: Provide value, especially in B2B, to ensure users understand the product and are likely to convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
3.  **Proof**: Include elements that show credibility and authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
4.  **Natural Progression to Offer**: Seamlessly transition from value to the product or service offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

Niels suggests starting with data from previous successful VSSLs or mimicking successful videos from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. When leading with a desired result (e.g., "this funnel got XYZ result for that cost"), it significantly helps marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

## Building a Startup with Funnels

For aspiring entrepreneurs, the process of [[Building a startup using AI tools | building a startup using AI tools]] and funnels can be:
1.  **Build an Audience and Learn Messaging**: Register social accounts, build an audience, and understand community messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Build a Landing Page/Quiz Funnel**: Before writing code, build a landing page or quiz funnel to further understand potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.
3.  **Send Free Traffic**: Start by sending free organic social traffic to the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
4.  **Iterate on Messaging**: Continuously refine messaging on both social media and the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.
5.  **Develop Product/Service**: While iterating, develop the software product or productized agency service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.

This approach forces entrepreneurs to become proficient at generating and converting traffic, and understanding their audience, before investing heavily in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.

![[comparing_websites_and_funnels_for_business_growth | Websites versus Funnels]]: Funnels are preferred over traditional websites due to their higher conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

Perspective also includes:
*   **CRM**: An easy-to-use CRM to collect and manage all lead data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.
*   **Automation**: Automated messaging capabilities within the CRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.
*   **Analytics**: Comprehensive metrics to track and optimize funnel performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

> "If you have a startup idea, I always say the first thing you could you should do is like register a social account like build an audience, learn the messaging, understand the community. That's the first thing you should do. Once you've done that, then before writing a line of code, even go and build a a landing page like this, set up a quizunnel basically. Try to even further understand your potential customer, your user, and you're sending traffic. I would start with free traffic personally. send that free traffic from organic social into your funnel. Uh iterate on the messaging, iterate, you know, and iterate on the messaging on the funnel. Iterate on the messaging social and then while that's happening, then you're vibe coding your software product or then you're vibe coding productized agency service. That's what the mistake I think a lot of people make is they go straight, you know, I spoke to someone yesterday who's like straight building the product, doesn't have an audience, hasn't figured out a good name. The beauty about this is it's a forcing function of getting really good at building traffic and then and then getting really good at converting and understanding who that traffic is." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>

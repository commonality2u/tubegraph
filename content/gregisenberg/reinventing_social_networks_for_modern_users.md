Following a billion-dollar company exit, an entrepreneur shares innovative ideas for new social platforms, focusing on travel, close-knit connections, and shared memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These concepts aim to address unmet needs in the current social media landscape, especially for millennials and Gen Z <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## The Anti-TripAdvisor Traveler App

Current mainstream travel sites like Trip Advisor and Expedia tend to funnel travelers to the same popular, SEO-optimized locations, resulting in homogenized experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with how younger generations, particularly millennials and Gen Z, prefer to travel, seeking "the path less taken" and authentic local experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

### Leveraging Social Media for Discovery
Today's travelers often turn to platforms like TikTok and Instagram to find unique spots. TikTok micro-influencers post aesthetically pleasing guides to hidden coffee shops, bookstores, and places for people-watching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. The "Creator Search Insights" feature on TikTok reveals trending travel topics and content gaps, indicating a demand for this type of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. Similarly, Instagram's map feature allows users to discover popular, real-time locations based on a "heat map" of photo density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

### Proposed App Features and Implementation
The idea is to create an app that serves as a "TikTok for modern travel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

*   **Niche Focus**: Start by identifying the most searched categories on TikTok (e.g., coffee shops, bookstores) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   **Guides**: Organize content into curated guides for specific cities and categories (e.g., "Coffee Guide of Seoul") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **Visual Content**: Utilize a video carousel format, similar to TikTok, to showcase the aesthetic and "vibe" of places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Guides could be monetized, offering a few free listings and charging a small fee (e.g., 99 cents) to unlock the full guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.
*   **Automation**: Leverage [[building_a_social_app_using_ai | AI tools]] like TikTok's API, Descript for transcription, Google's speech-to-text API, Claude AI, and ChatGPT API for content extraction and clean-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>. Zapier could automate publishing to a blog, creating an SEO machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.
*   **User Experience**: Allow users to save locations and guides for easy access when traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity**: Post-COVID travel has surged, with people prioritizing experiences and seeking new ways to discover cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.

> "People love experiences, they love to go to new cities, they love to go to cities they've been to many times and try new things there." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>

This concept aligns with the growing trend of directories, especially those that can be put on "autopilot" to build SEO authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.

## A Micro Social Network for Location Sharing

The way friends connect and track each other's whereabouts has become fractured, especially in a post-COVID world where people are more spread out globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>.

### Problems with Current Solutions
*   **Instagram Status Updates**: Many users post their current city on Instagram status updates, indicating a clear desire to share location with close friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>.
*   **Apple's Find My Friends**: While useful, it's a "very flat" tool that lacks depth and social interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>.
*   **Large Social Networks**: Platforms like Twitter and Facebook have evolved into broader, often public spaces that don't serve the need for a private, close-knit network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>.

### Reinventing "Path"
The ideal solution is a "Path-like" social network. Path, a private social network from 10-12 years ago, limited connections to about 150 close friends and family, based on Dunbar's Number â€“ a sociological theory suggesting humans can maintain only about 150 meaningful connections at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.

> "Path was the anti-version of the current state of social networks." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>

The proposed app would focus on:
*   **Simplicity**: A "micro social network" that does one thing exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>.
*   **Automated Location Updates**: Users could push a button to automatically update their city location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>.
*   **Proximity-Based Feed**: The feed would show friends based on proximity, facilitating spontaneous meetups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>.
*   **Private Network**: Similar to Path, it would be a closed, private network for true friends, encouraging conversation and contribution rather than just passive consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a>.
*   **Branding**: Naming it "Dunbar" could instantly communicate its purpose and story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: While Path monetized through sticker packs, a modern version could charge a modest annual subscription (e.g., $20-30/year) if a network effect is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>.
*   **Feasibility**: With [[building_a_social_app_using_ai | AI]], it's faster to build and beta-test such products without massive initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.

## Time Capsules of Shared Memories

Digital shared albums often become "where memories go to die," leading to a disconnect between easily captured photos and their enduring value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:34:00">[34:34:00]</a>. There's a human desire to revisit past experiences and share them in a meaningful way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:00]</a>.

### The Power of Nostalgia
Clout, a social network from 2013, successfully capitalized on nostalgia by reminding users of past memories from their connected social accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:08:00">[37:08:00]</a>. It went viral because people were inclined to share these nostalgic moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57:00">[37:57:00]</a>.

> "Nostalgia is a hell of a drug." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:27:00">[39:27:00]</a>

### Proposed "Time Capsule" Concept
The idea is to create a physical "Time Capsule" of shared memories, perhaps delivered as a high-touch gift.

*   **Personalized Gifts**: Users could curate a collection of photos and memorabilia from shared experiences with friends (e.g., a trip, a dinner party) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:00">[34:50:00]</a>.
*   **Ephemeral Nature**: To avoid obligation, these time capsules should feel "ephemeral," allowing recipients to enjoy and then potentially discard them after a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:52:00">[35:52:00]</a>.
*   **Format**: Could involve physical elements like printed photos on note cards with signatures, nicely packaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:45:00">[38:45:00]</a>.
*   **Bridging the Gap**: This concept seeks to fill the gap between digital photo threads and physical photo albums, offering a tangible yet non-permanent way to celebrate shared memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:30:00">[40:30:00]</a>.

The fundamental human needs for connection and nostalgia remain constant, even as the products we use to fulfill them evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>. These ideas for reinventing social networks aim to leverage new technologies and consumer behaviors to create more authentic and valuable social experiences.

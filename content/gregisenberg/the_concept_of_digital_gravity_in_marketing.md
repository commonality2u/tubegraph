From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

The traditional marketing funnel is considered an entirely wrong and deceptive way to think about modern marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Instead of a linear path where people enter and exit, actual purchasing behavior involves multiple interactions, disengagements, and re-engagements with a brand before a final purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This dynamic process is better visualized through the concept of **Digital Gravity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## What is Digital Gravity?

[[strategies_for_building_a_brand_using_digital_mass | Digital Gravity]] is a new way to think about building a brand or company by accumulating "digital mass" on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The more digital mass a brand has, the more influence it exerts within its niche or sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This mass is primarily built through content and pervasive marketing wherever the customer is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Think of it like this: A small company is a "small spec," and customers are like "comets" flying by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Initially, there's no influence on them. However, as a company builds more digital mass, it gains gravitational pull, drawing more people into its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. These individuals rotate around the brand multiple times before finally "touching down," which translates into revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This revenue then feeds back into growth, creating a "growth flywheel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Why the Funnel is Outdated

The traditional funnel implies a start and stop, similar to a military "campaign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. However, modern marketing is a continuous process; "you didn't do marketing, you're marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Customers often leave and re-enter the purchasing consideration process, sometimes weeks or even years later, interacting with a brand through various touchpoints like ads, newsletters, and word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Building Digital Mass: Tactical Applications

The strategy for building digital mass can be applied at the local business level, B2B level, and consumer level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### 1. For B2B Companies

Building a B2B company involves making it famous to its target audience within 12 months by continuously adding digital mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

*   **Target Audience Identification & Reach**
    *   **Scrape Emails:** For a smaller target audience (e.g., 50,000 people), scrape their emails using tools like Apollo.io or even LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
    *   **Custom Match Lists:** Import these emails into Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads to run targeted ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. About 30-40% of emails might match on platforms like Facebook Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
    *   **UGC AI Avatar Ads:** Create ads featuring AI avatars (e.g., HeyGen for avatars, Eleven Labs for voice) that speak directly to the target audience's pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
        *   Produce many variations (e.g., 100) with different hooks, settings, and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
        *   Allocate 80% of the ad budget to the best-performing variants (lowest CPC) and 20% for continuous testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
        *   Founders can use a digital clone of themselves to build personal fame within the target audience, leveraging the fact that "people buy from people, not brands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
    *   **Cold Email Strategy:** Use tools like Mail Reef (for AWS email servers) and Smart Lead or Instantly AI (for sending software) to cold email the scraped list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
        *   Maintain domain isolation by sending transactional, newsletter, and cold emails from separate domains to prevent compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
        *   Cold emails should mirror the problem-solution orientation of the ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
        *   Landing as much email as possible in an inbox creates more surface area, influencing leads over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
        *   Cold email "100% works" when messages are highly specific and address genuine problems, even for small, niche audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

*   **Content and Media Generation**
    *   **Podcast Creation:** Record customer conversations and feedback to create a podcast valuable to the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
        *   Distribute episodes via email to the scraped list (e.g., 200 emails/day) with summaries and key takeaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. Tools like MailerLite or Beehiiv can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
        *   This establishes the company as a media entity, providing educational content and building leverage within the industry (e.g., Rupa Health gaining negotiation power with labs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
        *   Monetize the audience through ad placements in the podcast and newsletter, turning the media arm from a cost center into a profit center (e.g., Athletic Greens subsidizing Rupa Health's growth team) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.
    *   **Content Repurposing:** Use AI-powered tools (like Swell AI) to transform video podcasts into transcripts, blog posts, white papers, and short-form social media clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. This falls under [[leveraging_ai_for_marketing_strategies | leveraging AI for marketing strategies]] and [[applications_of_ai_in_marketing_and_growth_strategies | applications of AI in marketing and growth strategies]].
        *   Schedule content across all relevant platforms (LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.) to grow media accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
        *   Example: LinkedIn shorts (from TikTok/Instagram Reels) can go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
    *   **Instagram-Only Ads:** Run impression-based ads with a call to action in the caption (e.g., "follow this account for more content like this") to grow followers cheaply (e.g., 30 cents per follower) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. This provides free impressions as the account grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.

*   **The Power of Layering:**
    *   Combining remarketing ads, weekly email newsletters, podcast promotion, social media posting, and personal connections creates an exponential growth trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.
    *   This continuous effort, though "grindy," leads to significant returns, like an email list driving 80,000 clicks/month for a fraction of the cost of traditional ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.
    *   Companies like Aero Electronics, Red Bull, and Y Combinator operate as media companies that also sell products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. Y Combinator, for example, is a media company that sells venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. This highlights the [[role_of_ai_in_marketing_and_business_growth | role of AI in marketing and business growth]] via content.
    *   Consistent engagement through long-form content, like a podcast, builds deep trust and "mental real estate" with the audience, making them more likely to become high-value leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.

### 2. For Consumer (B2C) Products

Consumer marketing is highly competitive and requires exceptional marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

*   **Market and Product Fit**
    *   **Huge Total Addressable Market (TAM):** Essential for consumer success as content needs to be broad enough to target a large subset of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.
    *   **Strong Core Application:** The app should do one thing exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
    *   **Impulse Pricing:** Consider a weekly pricing model (e.g., $7.99/week, which translates to $29/month) as an impulse purchase that can lead to 3 months of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>. This illustrates effective [[pricing_strategies_for_digital_products | pricing strategies for digital products]].

*   **Ad and Content Strategies**
    *   **Primary Ad Channels:** Focus on Facebook Ads and TikTok Ads for app installs and in-app conversion events (sign-up, paid action) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
    *   **UGC Creators and Testing:** Hire multiple UGC creators (e.g., 5-10 for $1,000/month for a video a day) to act as a testbed for viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>.
        *   Content should be hook-driven, address pain points, and position the product as the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.
        *   The goal is to create ads that feel like organic content rather than overt advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.
    *   **AI-Driven Content Remixing:** Create multiple (e.g., 10) TikTok accounts and remix best-performing UGC content using AI tools (ChatGPT for scripts, HeyGen for videos, Eleven Labs for audio, CapCut for editing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. This is part of [[using_marketing_strategies_for_aibased_apps | using marketing strategies for AI-based apps]].
    *   **Unique Product Name:** Choose a name that isn't highly competitive on Google to ensure clear search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.

*   **Leveraging Website and Influencers**
    *   **Pixel Tracking:** Install Facebook, TikTok, and Google pixels on the website to indefinitely run remarketing ads to visitors who show interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. This builds a larger remarketing audience over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>.
    *   **Email Nurture:** Collect emails on the website for an email nurture sequence that upsells the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.
    *   **Influencer Outreach at Scale:**
        *   Scrape emails from YouTube channels and other social media accounts (e.g., Instagram hashtags via IGleads.io) within the target category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. This demonstrates the power of [[digital_influencers_as_a_business_asset | digital influencers as a business asset]].
        *   Conduct cold email outreach to assess pricing and identify arbitrage opportunities in the imperfect influencer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.
        *   Negotiate deals typically involving a 3-video package (to build audience trust) plus an affiliate commission (e.g., 30% recurring payout) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>. This creates a moat around the relationship and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
        *   This strategy can achieve a significantly lower CPM (e.g., $5 vs. $10 on TikTok) compared to direct ad buys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.

*   **Programmatic SEO for Consumer Apps**
    *   For relevant categories, implement programmatic SEO to capture organic search traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. This is part of [[local_seo_and_digital_marketing_strategies | local SEO and digital marketing strategies]].
    *   As the app gains domain authority (trust from backlinks), it can rank for thousands of long-tail, low-difficulty keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
    *   **Content Generation:** Scrape top-ranking content for target keywords, use AI to create blog post outlines and initial drafts (section by section for quality), and publish large volumes (e.g., 10,000 articles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.
        *   A human SEO specialist can then edit articles only once they start receiving traffic, ensuring readability and Google ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.
    *   **Conversion Optimization:** Include clear calls to action (e.g., "sign up for the app for free") after the first paragraph, and have a full-screen pop-up occur at 25-50% scroll depth on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>. This further feeds into the remarketing funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

The fundamental goal is to get as many eyeballs on the product as cheaply as possible, using a continuous "surface area game" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. This strategy has led to "insane growth trajectories" for consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>, proving that even traditional ad channels still offer significant opportunities when approached with innovative content and consistent effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.

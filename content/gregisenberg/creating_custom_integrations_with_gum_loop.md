Gum Loop enables users to build their own custom integrations, allowing them to connect with internal data or third-party services not natively supported on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>. This feature was developed to address the needs of large customers who required interaction with their own internal endpoints or unsupported third-party services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:50">[03:05:50]</a>.

## Building Custom Nodes

Custom nodes are created within a dedicated builder interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">[03:11:11]</a>. To build a custom node:
1.  Navigate to the custom node category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:14">[03:11:14]</a>.
2.  Provide the documentation for the desired integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:32">[03:31:32]</a>. The AI understands the context of a Gum Loop integration and its available packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:03">[03:32:03]</a>.
3.  Specify inputs (e.g., "company") and outputs for the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:45">[03:11:45]</a>.
4.  Users can add their own API keys for services they already pay for, potentially reducing Gum Loop costs to near zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:19">[03:29:19]</a>.

Once created, custom nodes are accessible to everyone within a user's workspace, fostering collaboration among team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:13">[03:17:13]</a>. The code of these custom integrations can be edited by those who built them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:31">[03:32:31]</a>.

## AI Assistance in Custom Node Creation

A significant aspect of custom node creation is the integration of AI. The platform's AI assists in generating the code for the integration based on the provided documentation and user prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:55">[03:31:55]</a>. For instance, users can instruct the AI to "add comments throughout the code" to improve readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:34">[03:32:34]</a>.

Looking ahead, Gum Loop aims to further streamline this process, envisioning a future where users can simply hit a command on the canvas and describe the desired integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:26">[03:14:26]</a>. The AI would then automatically:
*   Name the integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:18">[03:33:18]</a>.
*   Select an appropriate icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:20">[03:33:20]</a>.
*   Determine inputs and write the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:22">[03:33:22]</a>.
*   Test the integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:23">[03:33:23]</a>.

This would eliminate the need to manually enter the custom node builder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:50">[03:32:50]</a>.

## Use Cases and Benefits

Custom nodes empower semi-technical individuals within companies to build complex automations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:51">[03:51:51]</a>. Examples include:
*   Building Twitter scrapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:59">[03:29:59]</a>.
*   Scraping platforms like Blue Sky for social media analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   Creating integrations with development teams without being a developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:04">[03:30:04]</a>.

The ability to create custom integrations makes Gum Loop a platform for building "your own software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:16">[03:15:16]</a>. This allows companies to automate repetitive tasks and focus on high-leverage activities, gaining an [[ai_workflow_integration_strategies | unfair advantage]] in their business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>. It enables precise, hyper-customized workflows tailored to specific business problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:09">[04:09:09]</a>. This is particularly valuable given that many large companies still operate with significant manual processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:08">[03:38:08]</a>.

AI tools offer significant opportunities to reduce costs associated with human labor and repetitive, frustrating tasks. The core principle behind valuing and pricing AI solutions is to assess the amount and cost of human input they replace, including both financial and "emotional damage" components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:13">[34:52:13]</a>.

## Valuing AI by Human Cost Savings

When developing an AI product, particularly in the B2B sector, a key strategy is to identify tasks that are a "real pain in the ass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:64">[05:34:64]</a> and time-consuming for humans, then automate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:07">[02:09:07]</a>. The value of an AI solution can be directly linked to the human input it saves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:13">[34:52:13]</a>.

The pricing strategy for AI services should consider:
*   **Total cost of human labor** replaced (salary, benefits, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:59:00">[34:59:00]</a>.
*   **"Emotional damage" or frustration** saved by automating annoying tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:54">[35:01:54]</a>. Even tasks that take only "five or 10 minutes" can be worth more if they cause significant annoyance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:13:58">[35:13:58]</a>.
*   **A discount applied to the total saved cost** (e.g., 50% to 80% discount) to create a "no-brainer offer" for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:44:09">[35:44:09]</a>.

> [!info] Business Philosophy and Pricing
> Companies with a "mercenary approach" can achieve financial success by making money through their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:99">[34:36:99]</a>. However, the most successful companies often view making money as a means to create "better services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:25:27">[34:25:27]</a>, similar to Walt Disney's philosophy of making money to make more movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:13:30">[34:13:30]</a>. This means deciding on a core identity before defining a pricing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:48">[34:40:48]</a>.

## Examples of AI Applications for Cost Savings

AI agents can automate a variety of manual and repetitive tasks, leading to significant [[the_impact_of_ai_on_business_productivity | productivity improvements]] and cost reductions:

### Personal & Administrative Tasks
*   Booking flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>, hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>, or restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:90">[02:45:90]</a>.
*   Scheduling appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:46">[04:01:46]</a>.
*   Personalized recall moments, such as finding a specific investor based on vague details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:50">[04:47:50]</a>.
*   Note-taking and collaborative document creation during meetings, like the tool Granola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:27">[09:39:27]</a>.

### Business Operations
*   **Financial Crime Compliance:** Greenlight automates enhanced due diligence by searching the web and compiling information with a single click, replacing "really manual work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:15">[05:17:15]</a>. This is critical for banks and financial products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.
*   **Customer Service:** Gradient AI builds customer service agents that "dramatically outperform" existing AI solutions like Intercom's built-in AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:79">[10:59:79]</a>.
*   **AI Phone Calls (Bland):** This AI enables automated phone calls for sales, customer support, and operations in any language, allowing users to "teach it like an employee" and integrate with existing tools like Salesforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:77">[12:04:77]</a>.
*   **Debt Collection (Domu):** AI agents can handle debt collection by being "deeply empathetic and thoughtful," asking questions like, "do you think you could afford to do $100 right now?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:78">[13:18:78]</a>. This automates the empathetic script that is hard to consistently achieve with human agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:84">[14:00:84]</a>.
*   **Social Media Management:** AI can address pain points such as content creation and scheduling, consistently producing engaging, high-quality content across multiple platforms, managing content calendars and approval workflows, and even crisis communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:07">[15:07:07]</a>. AI can also create platform-specific formats from assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:64">[15:27:64]</a>.

By automating these "pain in the ass" tasks, AI provides substantial [[benefits_of_ai_over_human_employees | benefits of AI over human employees]], allowing businesses to save on salaries and the hidden costs of human frustration and manual effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:54">[35:01:54]</a>.

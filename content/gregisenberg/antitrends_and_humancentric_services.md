## Understanding Antitrends
An antitrend is a concept where, for every prevailing trend, an opposing trend naturally emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. These opposing movements can often lead to some of the most compelling [[understanding_antitrends_for_startup_ideas | startup ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. While a trend might attract significant competition, an antitrend often has substantially less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

### Examples of Antitrends
*   **Biohacking and Longevity vs. Hedonism:** A trend like biohacking and longevity, exemplified by figures such as Brian Johnson who aim to optimize health and live longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, has an antitrend in embracing a hedonistic lifestyle focused on living fully in the present, even if it means a shorter lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **The "Hundred Club" vs. The "Zero Club" for Sleep:** In the context of sleep optimization (e.g., using technologies like Eight Sleep to achieve perfect sleep scores), a trend would be striving for a "Hundred Club" status of perfect sleep fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. The antitrend would be the "Zero Club," representing those who intentionally minimize or forgo sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

## AI Trends vs. Human-Centric Services
The rise of [[AI and technology trends | AI and technology trends]], particularly in app development, highlights a clear distinction between highly scalable automated services and potentially lucrative human-centric services.

### The Rise of AI Coaching Applications
Recent trends show the emergence of successful [[micro_app_trends_and_ai_startup_studios | AI startup studios]] that build applications using [[AI and technology trends | AI]], often as wrappers around large language models like Chat GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. These apps leverage strong branding and referral flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Riz (Plug AI):** An [[AI and technology trends | AI]] dating coach that helps users with pickup lines and responses by analyzing text messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. One such app was reportedly making $190,000 per month with 333,000 downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The founder of a related studio, AI RZ, reported launching three apps collectively generating $500,000 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Astra:** An [[AI and technology trends | AI]]-powered life advice application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Pallet:** An [[AI and technology trends | AI]] app that determines a user's color season from a selfie and generates personalized style and makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

These apps act as "coaching" platforms across different verticals, requiring minimal new technology development by leveraging existing [[AI and technology trends | AI]] frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### The Human-Centric Antitrend
Despite the success of [[AI and technology trends | AI]]-driven services, there is an "equal demand on the human side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. This human-centric approach can be an antitrend to the widespread adoption of [[AI and technology trends | AI]] tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

Benefits of pursuing human-centric antitrends:
*   **Premium Pricing:** Human services can often command a premium price compared to their [[AI and technology trends | AI]] counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage:** They offer a way to compete with [[AI and technology trends | AI]] products by emphasizing real human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Service Evolution:** [[Productizing_AI_for_traditional_services | Productized services for agencies]] could evolve from [[AI and technology trends | AI]] app models. An [[AI and technology trends | AI]] app, for example, could offer a premium upgrade option that includes human intervention, serving as an entry point into a more comprehensive human coaching service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## Practicality in Business Ventures
Building businesses, even those that might be considered a "flash in the pan" or not "world-changing," can be highly practical and beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. Achieving financial stability or a significant capital base (referred to as "your first nut") can be a crucial step before attempting to "change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The skills acquired in running such ventures, regardless of their longevity, are transferable to future endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. This perspective highlights a "financial practicality" that is sometimes missing in broader business discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

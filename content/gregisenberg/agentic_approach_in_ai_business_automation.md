From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

The "agentic approach" involves utilizing [[AI agents and automation | AI agents]] to perform tasks that teams of people traditionally handled, presenting a significant opportunity for business builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The true potential lies not in creating better AI models, but in [[Building automated businesses with AI | building businesses around AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The tools are already available, and the market desires these solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

This approach is driven by the desire to automate human-skill-based tasks and [[leveraging_ai_for_business_efficiency | leverage AI as a powerful accelerator]] across all aspects of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, from ideation and organization to operation and feature implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. The underlying philosophy suggests that those who can automate extensively often achieve greater wealth by focusing on good economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

## Practical Use Cases for AI Agents in Business

### 1. AI Co-founder Service (Virtual Always-On Co-founder)

This concept envisions a virtual, 24/7, always-available [[AI agents and automation | AI co-founder]] that handles tasks a solo founder might find tedious or challenging, such as marketing, sales, or business development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

Key functionalities:
*   **Task Execution & Idea Generation** An AI could constantly think about tasks and even execute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Founders already use tools like ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude for brainstorming and generating content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Personalized Marketing & Sales** The AI could learn the founder's voice and tone, then intelligently scrape the web and other data sources to build an internal representation of target customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This allows it to figure out the best way to communicate with potential clients and even initiate conversations or provide tailored tools for outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Scalability & Specialization** A business offering this service could provide specialized AI roles, such as a marketing AI, CTO AI, or sales AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. These virtual agents could even interact with each other in "AI on AI meetings," exchanging ideas and bringing new insights to the business, akin to Mastermind groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.
*   **Training & Personality Alignment** Users would train their AI agents on their specific codebases, documents, and knowledge bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. This training would also align the AI's personality with the founder's preferences, potentially allowing users to choose an AI persona (e.g., a "Peter Thiel-like" or "Elon Musk-like" agent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing the Human Element** While an AI co-founder won't offer emotional support like a human, its value lies in its pragmatic, relentless dedication to tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. It won't experience social tension or anxiety, continuing to work until the last second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.
*   **Pricing Strategy** Pricing could be based on the ROI provided, for instance, replacing the cost of multiple full-time developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06:00">[34:06:00]</a>. A potential starting point could be $50-$100 per month for foundational services, scaling up with added capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:54:00">[35:54:00]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping the MVP** A bootstrapped approach would involve streamlining existing, clumsy AI usage by founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. This includes automatically pulling information, adding documents for retrieval, and unifying conversations into one platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.

### 2. Silent Refactoring as a Service (Automated Code Improvement)

This idea proposes a service that continuously analyzes and improves a codebase, connecting to a repository and acting as an autonomous developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>.

Core functionalities:
*   **Automated Code Analysis** The service would check for errors, lint code, and analyze it for syntax or logic errors, suggesting fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>. Tools like Sentry are already starting to offer beta features that suggest fixes and create pull requests for errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement & Optimization** The ultimate goal is for the AI to constantly refactor and improve code by taking a module, making changes, simulating the application's performance with those changes, and running unit and integration tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:00">[23:39:00]</a>. This iterative process of optimization and testing would present tangibly improved, fully tested, and commented code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:24]</a>.
*   **Proactive Roadmap Integration** The tool would connect to the roadmap and anticipate future features, proactively improving the database schema, codebase, and documentation to facilitate easier implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>.
*   **Pricing Model** Pricing could be based on a "per connected repository" basis or on a "cadence" of how often new experiments are run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:07:00">[33:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50:00">[33:50:00]</a>. To manage computational costs, the service could offload some testing and staging expenses to the customer's existing infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:00]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity** This service could compete with or be acquired by large companies like Sentry, a multi-billion-dollar error tracking company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>. Building an [[automating_business_processes_with_ai | AI-based business]] in this domain could serve as a "job application" or a stepping stone for individuals to join larger firms looking for AI expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:08:16]</a>.

### 3. Niche Data Aggregation & Summarization Platform

This idea focuses on [[leveraging_ai_for_business_innovation | addressing the information overload]] caused by algorithmic timelines on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>. The goal is to build a platform that aggregates, summarizes, and delivers highly relevant information to specific niches, allowing users to regain control over their information consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:48:00">[38:48:00]</a>.

Key functionalities:
*   **Niche-Specific Aggregation** The platform would collect and extract data from various sources relevant to a specific niche, including real-time data streams, APIs, news sites, social media influencers, and even scanned magazines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:15:00">[39:15:00]</a>.
*   **Personalized Summarization & Delivery** The crucial twist is tailoring summaries to the exact needs and consumption preferences of each subscriber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:54:00">[39:54:00]</a>. This could range from dense bullet points for quick overviews to detailed paragraphs or even 2,000-word emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a>.
*   **Diverse Medium Delivery** The information could be delivered in various preferred mediums:
    *   Fake podcast conversations between AI "experts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:32:00">[40:32:00]</a>.
    *   Short, "James Clear-style" newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:13:00">[41:13:00]</a>.
    *   AI-generated news stories or videos with screen grabs and articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:18:00">[41:18:00]</a>.
*   **Founder Advantage** This model works best for individuals who are already dabblers or experts in the target niche, enabling them to speak the language of their audience and create more effective prompts for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:15:00">[44:15:00]</a>.
*   **Monetization & Evolution** The platform could offer a free tier (e.g., 99% of content) and a paid subscription for premium access (e.g., $9/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:40:00">[42:40:00]</a>. This type of business can also serve as a "wedge," potentially evolving into a SaaS platform that addresses specific logistical or other needs within that community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:18:00">[45:18:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing Information Thirst** The core value proposition is to help an audience, "really thirsty for not having to do the work but getting all the good results" by crunching vast amounts of data into bite-sized, digestible formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:53:00">[41:53:00]</a>.

All three ideas highlight the power of [[practical_use_cases_for_ai_agents_in_business | AI agents]] to address real-world problems and create significant value, particularly for solo founders and small businesses looking to maximize [[automation_and_ai_in_small_businesses | business efficiency]] through automation and intelligent data processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

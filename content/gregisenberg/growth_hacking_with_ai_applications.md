New AI models are enabling a novel approach to [[growth_tactics_for_ai_startups | growth tactics for AI startups]], particularly through the creation of highly engaging, viral applications and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>. This strategy focuses on generating attention and driving user acquisition by leveraging popular AI tools to build interactive experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Alex Finn's Strategy for Virality

Alex Finn, an experienced developer, has achieved millions of impressions by creating video games using AI and just a few prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. His approach demonstrates how to use AI applications as a way to [[growth_tactics_for_ai_startups | growth hack any product]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.

Finn's method involves:
*   **Building AI games** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>: Over the last eight months, he has built AI games that have gone viral on X (formerly Twitter), leading to significant growth for his newsletter and AI app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>. Games appear to be the most "eye-catching hook" for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:47">[02:18:47]</a>.

### Core AI Tools
1.  **Grock**: The newest AI model, Grock, is described as "super super powerful" and offers free tools like Deep Search and Think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:15">[05:22:15]</a>.
    *   **Deep Search**: Excellent for scouring the web, doing research, and building a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:44">[07:08:44]</a>.
    *   **Think**: A reasoning model that executes the plan and builds the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:47">[07:20:47]</a>.
    *   Grock is noted for its incredible speed and detailed "Chain of Thought" output, making it much faster than some other AI models for similar tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
2.  **P5.js**: A free JavaScript gaming framework with an excellent website for quick testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:04">[07:46:04]</a>. It allows instant game previews by pasting code and hitting play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:12">[09:12:12]</a>.
3.  **Cursor**: An AI agent that allows users to build whatever they want, integrating with models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.

### Database Integration
*   **Superbase**: Described as "probably the easiest for beginners to use database for apps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. It's free for starting and experimenting, even supporting thousands of users on a free version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. It's used to store high scores and email addresses for newsletter or [[marketing_and_user_acquisition_for_ai_startups | marketing list growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

### Hosting
*   **GitHub Pages**: The easiest way to deploy a prototype game live on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. It involves creating a repository and enabling GitHub Pages in settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>.

### Process Outline:
1.  **Generate Game Plan with Grock Deep Search**: Prompt Grock to design the game, including sprites and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:40">[07:41:40]</a>.
2.  **Generate Code with Grock Think**: Use the Think mode to create the full code block based on the generated plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
3.  **Test Code with P5.js**: Quickly paste the generated code into the P5.js editor to see an instant preview of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.
4.  **Refine and Enhance with Cursor**: Import the code into Cursor. This is where enhancements, debugging, and integrations occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>.
    *   **AI as a Product Manager**: A key strategy is to ask the AI questions about design decisions, such as game mechanics, as it can often provide better design solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:56">[02:55:56]</a>.
    *   **Iterative Debugging**: If issues arise, simply tell the AI what's not working, and it will identify and fix the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
5.  **Integrate Superbase for Leaderboard and Email Capture**: Prompt Cursor to add a high score leaderboard, collect email addresses when users lose, and integrate with Superbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. Claude 3.7 Sonnet can even generate a `README` file with setup instructions, including SQL commands for Superbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
6.  **Deploy Live with GitHub Pages**: Push the code to a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages to host the game on a public URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>.

## Keys to Viral Content

*   **Gamification**: Games are proven to be highly engaging and compelling for a general audience compared to static content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:47">[02:18:47]</a>.
*   **Current Events and Memes**: Integrate trending jokes, memes, or current events into the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. For example, turning the Mitch McConnell freezing meme into a game went viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>. AI tools can even take an image of a meme and turn it into a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>.
*   **Competitive Elements**: Adding a leaderboard and competition, like offering a prize for the highest score, significantly increases viral potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.
*   **Effective X (Twitter) Posting**:
    *   Post a video of the game first, as media boosts posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>.
    *   Include a hook like "This is wild" or "I just built an insanely fun game in just three prompts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.
    *   Share the link in a second tweet a few hours later to avoid algorithm suppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.
    *   Encourage replies with screenshots of scores to further boost engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.

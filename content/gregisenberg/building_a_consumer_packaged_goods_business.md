Building a Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) business involves understanding market demand, leveraging data and trends, and strategically differentiating products. Ashwin, an expert in launching and growing [[building_successful_businesses_through_targeted_media_strategies | consumer brands]] and physical products, shares insights on how to create products that appeal to millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Many lessons from the CPG space can also be applied to a [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_cpg_and_software_sectors | software startup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Evaluating Opportunities and Trends

Successful CPG businesses often start by evaluating opportunities and understanding market demand, rather than just building an idea on a hunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Using Ahrefs for Market Research

Ahrefs is a powerful tool primarily used for SEO (Search Engine Optimization), but it's invaluable for understanding category demand and trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. It provides:
*   **Search Volume**: A general sense of how many times a keyword, term, or brand is searched on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Keyword Difficulty**: A score from 0 to 100 indicating how hard it is to rank for that term on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. A high difficulty (e.g., 88 for "electrolytes") indicates significant competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

#### Case Studies from Ahrefs Data
*   **Electrolytes**: Show a rising trend in demand with seasonal pops in June and July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. While competitive in English-speaking Western countries, there might be opportunities to build a brand like "Element for Germany" due to lower search volume in other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Solitaire**: Despite high search volume (8.5 million monthly searches), the market is saturated with established players who are "cash cows," making it hard to acquire existing sites. One entrepreneur successfully built a new Solitaire site from scratch and out-ranked competitors after 24 months of dedicated SEO effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **CBD vs. Delta 9**: CBD search volume exploded in 2019 following the 2018 farm bill but has steadily declined since. This decline correlates with the rise of Delta 9, a legal THC derived from hemp, which has seen explosive growth since 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:14:02]</a>. This highlights the importance of asking "why" behind data trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

> "A lot of people start with an idea and they're like oh I think that would be great like I know four vet clinics and they all say they have an issue with like their accounting software I want to go build it then they build it and then they're like oh damn was their demand for it or was it too crowded already." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>

### Using Particle for E-commerce Analysis

Particle is a tool that allows users to analyze the sales and product data of any e-commerce brand, even if they are not public companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Sales Over Time**: Track a brand's sales from their e-commerce website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   **Bestselling SKUs**: Identify which products or flavors contribute most to a company's revenue. This helps to de-risk product decisions, as 90% of a company's revenue might come from just a few top-selling items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. For example, if competitors are primarily selling chocolate and vanilla flavored supplements, it's wise to start with those <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Trend Explorer**: Particle also has its own trend explorer for products and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

Similar sales data can be found on platforms like TikTok Shop and Amazon, which often show sales figures (e.g., "100K bought in the last month") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

## Case for Starting a Physical Product Business

While building a physical product business is challenging due to complexities like supply chain, finances, and inventory forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>, it offers unique advantages:

*   **Marketing Expertise**: It's a phenomenal way to become proficient in marketing because the "bleeding edge of marketing" often occurs in the consumer product world, where it's exceptionally difficult to capture attention and convince individuals to make a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
*   **Learning Business Fundamentals**: Entrepreneurs learn extensively about cash conversion cycles, operating margins, and inventory management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Low-Stakes Entry**: If done in a low-risk way (e.g., without betting one's entire career or throwing excessive cash), it can be a valuable learning experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

## Standing Out in a Crowded Market: Branding and Differentiation

Even with category demand, it's hard to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
*   **Visual Branding**: Differentiating through a distinct look and feel is crucial. For example, Moon Juice stands out with its amber jar and unique brand compared to generic, medical-looking magnesium glycinate supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.
*   **Custom Packaging**: Brands like Lemi (Courtney Kardashian's brand) invest in custom bottles, cool ridges, and unique caps to differentiate and appeal to a specific audience (e.g., Gen Z women) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   **Targeted Positioning**: Hyper-targeting a specific niche in early stages is vital. Brands like Seed differentiate through their consumer communication, visual appeal, and targeted audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

### Identifying Untapped Niches
There's an opportunity to apply "well-designed, well-branded products" to demographics not currently targeted by current trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.
*   **Beyond Millennial Blanding and Gen Z Saturation**: The market has seen eras of "Millennial Blanding" (e.g., Harry's, Casper) and now a "Gen Z" aesthetic (bright, vibrant, saturated like Starface) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:27:10]</a>. These trends result from founders creating products for themselves and their friends, leading to crowded markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.
*   **Opportunity in Older Adults**: Consider taking a successful concept like Starface pimple patches and applying it to older adults. This demographic often has more disposable income and consumes information from less saturated channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

## Bootstrap Methods for Product Development

It's possible to start a CPG business without a huge initial investment:
*   **Problem-Solution Oriented Products**: For products where design isn't the *most* critical aspect (e.g., Mighty Patch vs. Starface), simpler design solutions can be created using tools like Canva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
*   **Hiring Freelance Designers**: Platforms like Fiverr and Upwork allow entrepreneurs to hire independent freelance designers for simple packaging design or landing page setups for a few hundred dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
*   **Leveraging AI Tools**:
    *   **Midjourney (and similar AI image generators)**: Can generate V1 designs for packaging or branding, which can then be refined by a human designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. One example shows a founder using Midjourney to create packaging designs, then hiring a Fiverr designer for $250 to recreate them in vector format and make minor changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.
    *   **Manis (AI agent)**: This AI tool can research competitors, analyze product details, and research specific demographic needs (e.g., skincare for older adults) to generate product concepts and designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:37:33]</a>. It can provide a comprehensive report and prototype in minutes, a task that might otherwise cost thousands of dollars from traditional consulting firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.

> "There is no excuse to go into a space and be like oh man I was like ill equipped like I don't have enough like I didn't do enough research on the category because it can all just be done for you right now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>

*   **Clarify Your Vision First**: It's crucial to do the "hard work" of developing a mood board, positioning, and copy before engaging an agency, as this clarifies the vision and ensures better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

## Relentless Research and Developing a Strong Point of View

Whether building software or [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_cpg_and_software_sectors | consumer products]], entrepreneurs must be relentless researchers of their category and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.

*   **Analyze Competitors**: Systematically review existing brands, their positioning, visuals, and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>. Understand who they are speaking to and their one-sentence takeaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   **Gather Direct Insights**: Visit stores and talk to owners about what's selling, what customers are looking for, and what's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. For [[b2b_versus_b2c_startups | B2B]] software, this means looking at reviews (especially 1-star and 2-star complaints) and talking to staff in relevant businesses (e.g., dentists' offices for dental CRM software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. These "hard to do" actions provide immense insight and build confidence in the brand's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>.

> "You don't want to go off hunches that this is the right direction." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>

## Key Takeaway

Regardless of whether you're building a [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_cpg_and_software_sectors | software startup]] or a [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_cpg_and_software_sectors | CPG product]], the most important thing is to **start by working backwards from distribution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Identify the channels where you can acquire customers and win, and *then* build the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.

> "First time Founders focus on product, second time Founders focus on distribution." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>

Even "subpar products" can succeed if they have "incredible distribution and operational excellence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.

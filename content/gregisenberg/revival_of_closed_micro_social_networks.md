The concept of a "micro social network" focuses on creating a minimalist platform that excels at one specific function, particularly for close friends and family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This idea is presented as a solution to the increasingly public and broad nature of mainstream social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

## The Problem with Modern Social Media

Current major social networks like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have evolved into products that often lead to information overload and a lack of intimate connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. Users find themselves scrolling through vast amounts of content, often from hundreds or thousands of connections, rather than engaging directly with their closest circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>. The speaker highlights a personal observation on Instagram where 90% of status updates are people sharing their current city, indicating a clear desire among friends to know each other's whereabouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. While Apple's Find My Friends offers some location sharing, it lacks depth as a social network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

## Reimagining Path: A Historical Precedent

The inspiration for a revived micro social network comes from a private social network called "Path," which existed about 10 to 12 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. Path's core premise was a closed network for very close friends and family, limiting connections to around 150 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. This limit was based on Dunbar's Number, a sociology theory suggesting humans can only maintain about 150 stable connections at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. Path was seen as the "anti-version" of the sprawling social networks of its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a> and was eventually sold to Google for approximately $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.

### The Dunbar App: A New Vision
The proposed app, potentially named "Dunbar" to leverage the underlying sociological theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>, would serve as a reinvention of Path for today's world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

Key features would include:
*   **Automatic Location Updates**: A simple button push to automatically update one's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. It wouldn't necessarily need to be exact GPS, but rather indicate being in the same city or region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.
*   **Proximity-Based Feed**: A simplified feed showing friends based on their proximity, facilitating real-time meetups or conversation starters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.
*   **Focus on Contribution**: Encouraging users to create information that sparks conversations, moving away from passive consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.
*   **Aesthetic and Polish**: Updating the user experience to meet modern (2025) design standards while retaining Path's core philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

## Building and Monetization

Developing a consumer social app is considered "hard mode" for startups due to the difficulty of achieving network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. However, advancements in [[building_a_social_media_app_using_ai | AI]] make it faster and less expensive to create such products, reducing the need for significant initial investment or large development teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

For monetization, Path historically sold sticker packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. A modern "Dunbar" could potentially implement a subscription model, charging users around $20-$30 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. The underlying demand for a closed-off network with close friends is strong, making this a potentially multi-million dollar bootstrap business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.

## Beyond Location: Shared Memories and Nostalgia

The idea of closed networks also extends to sharing and curating memories. The speaker notes that "shared albums are where your memories go to die" on current platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. There's a desire to share "time capsules of shared memories" with friends from trips or past events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

This concept draws from "Clout," an old social network that monetized on [[innovation_in_sharing_and_creating_nostalgic_memories | nostalgia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. Clout would remind users of past memories from connected social accounts, leveraging the human love for looking back on life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>. While Clout struggled with network effects, the underlying emotional appeal of nostalgia is powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. A physical time capsule of curated photos, possibly printed and well-packaged, could serve as a highly personal, ephemeral gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. This bridges the gap between casual digital sharing and physical albums, offering a unique opportunity in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.

Building a strong brand is a crucial step in the development and growth of mobile applications, particularly for consumer apps. A well-crafted brand helps users understand what the app is about, fosters resonance, and encourages user engagement and sharing.

## Key Principles of Brand Building for Mobile Apps

Hunter Isacson, an app developer with over 300 million downloads for his consumer apps, emphasizes several principles for building a successful brand:

### 1. Build a Brand People Love and Resonate With
A fundamental aspect of brand building is creating a brand that users connect with and understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. This means that when users look at the app, they should immediately grasp its purpose and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. Hunter Isacson's apps like Wink, NGL, and Bags exemplify this by having simple names that resonate with their target audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

### 2. Keep it Simple and Obvious
Complex or confusing names can deter users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Hunter recommends sticking to short, obvious names that clearly communicate the app's function or target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

### 3. Utilize Community Slang and Language
A highly effective strategy is to incorporate the slang or specific language of the target community into the app's name and in-app copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.
*   **Bags.fm:** This crypto app leverages the term "bags," which is common slang within the crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. This approach sets a "young and like comfortable and like colloquial" tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>, making the app feel like it understands its users' language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.
*   **NGL:** The anonymous messaging app is named after the internet acronym "not going to lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. This made it easy for young people to understand its anonymous nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

By using such language, developers can create a brand that feels relatable, staying relevant and comfortable for young audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

### 4. Foster Authenticity
Presenting the app authentically and communicating publicly in a real, relatable voice is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.
*   The Instagram account for NGL, with 2 million followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>, features meme formats and funny messages, aligning with a fun, youth-skewing brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.
*   The Bags Twitter account, with over 100,000 followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>, is very active, maintaining an authentic, memeable, and funny voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

Authenticity increases affinity and trust, making users love the product more and want to share it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. This also provides an unfair advantage against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

### 5. Create a "Stay A While" Experience
The goal is to design an app experience that makes people want to stay and not leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. Making users feel comfortable through the brand and design is a significant part of achieving this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. Hunter Isacson designs all aspects of his apps himself, including the branding, often using Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

## Brand Building as a Part of the App Development Playbook

Brand building is integrated into the broader app development playbook, especially when aiming for significant growth:

1.  **Build a Brand** people love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
2.  Build a simple, bare-bones MVP experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.
3.  Get initial users (a couple hundred to a couple thousand) and test content on platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.
4.  Select a core action or "northstar metric" and ensure a high percentage of users (over 90%) complete it within a single user flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.
5.  Continuously seed the app by applying pressure in different niches, audiences, and countries, leveraging creators and incorporating sharing/inviting mechanisms into the core experience to increase the K-factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.

This integrated approach, where brand building is foundational to product design and [[strategies_for_successful_consumer_app_growth | growth strategies]], has proven effective in achieving massive downloads with minimal marketing spend, as seen with NGL's 250 million downloads achieved with less than $10,000 in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

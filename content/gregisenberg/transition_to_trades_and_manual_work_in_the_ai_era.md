## Changing Landscape of Work
The rise of [[Role of AI in automating manual processes | AI]] is fundamentally shifting the job market, automating many white-collar jobs in a way the Industrial Revolution automated physical labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. This means that work requiring physical interaction and manual skill is becoming increasingly scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## The Value of Manual Labor
As [[Role of AI in automating manual processes | AI]] takes over cognitive tasks, there's a growing "tactile joy" in creating physical objects, indicating a return to valuing hands-on work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In the [[Role of AI in automating manual processes | AI]] era, the true status symbol may become the ability to disconnect from constant information flow and engage in manual activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Trade jobs, such as plumbers and electricians, are no longer perceived with the stigma they once carried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. In fact, these roles are becoming more financially rewarding and secure than many traditional white-collar positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Currently, there is a significant shortage of skilled tradespeople, with many nearing retirement, indicating a pressing market need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Business Opportunities in Trades Education
A promising business idea in this changing landscape is to establish a "Lambda School for trades" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This model would involve:
*   **Specialized Training** Focusing on a specific trade like painting, landscaping, plumbing, electrical work, or woodworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Job Placement & Revenue Share** Training individuals with zero upfront tuition, finding them jobs, and then taking a percentage cut of their future income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Customer Acquisition Support** Providing trained individuals with the tools to attract customers, such as managing Facebook ads and creating websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Elevating the Status of Trade Jobs
A crucial element for such a venture's success would be to build a compelling brand that elevates the status of these trade jobs, attracting a new generation of workers by showcasing the real money and career stability available in these fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This approach stands apart from typical tech ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, addressing a fundamental shift in economic value in an [[Role of AI in automating manual processes | AI]]-driven world.

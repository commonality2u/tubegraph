## Anticipated Improvements and Model Upgrades
The underlying models powering [[Google Firebase Studio overview | Firebase Studio]] are expected to improve significantly over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. A key area for development is the adoption of Google's best model for code generation, [[Google AI Studio capabilities | Gemini]] 2.5 Pro, for the app prototyping agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. This model is known for its effectiveness in generating UI elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. As Google's models become smarter through user prompting, the capabilities of [[Google Firebase Studio overview | Firebase Studio]] will also enhance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

## Competitive Landscape
Experts are "bullish" on the future of [[Google Firebase Studio overview | Firebase Studio]], predicting it will become a "mega competitor" to existing tools like Cursor and Windsurf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>. It is believed that Google may even leverage private models, not yet released to the public, for the future of [[Google Firebase Studio overview | Firebase Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

While [[Google Firebase Studio overview | Firebase Studio]] is currently more tailored for technical users compared to platforms like [[Comparison between Firebase Studio and Lovable | Lovable]] or Bolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, its evolution could see it become a more robust and user-friendly option for a wider audience, including those looking to develop [[Building iOS apps using AI tools | iOS apps using AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

> "I say that not by saying I don't see like don't use [[Google Firebase Studio overview | Firebase Studio]]. I say it by I see where [[Google Firebase Studio overview | Firebase Studio]] is going to go. It's going to be a mega competitor to Cursor Windsurf 100%." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>

## Strategic Importance for Google
[[Google Firebase Studio overview | Firebase Studio]] is seen as a high-leverage product that will attract a significant number of users into the broader [[Using Firebase for authentication and storage in AI applications | Firebase ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. As Firebase is increasingly used for consumer mobile apps that require backend services for analytics and user data, [[Google Firebase Studio overview | Firebase Studio]] enhances Google's position in this growing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

Google's entry into the AI coding tool space, with products like [[Google Firebase Studio overview | Firebase Studio]], reflects external pressures from competitors like [[Comparison between Firebase Studio and Lovable | Lovable]] and Cursor, which have seen rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. Despite its early stage, the product is expected to mature rapidly.

## User Experience and Future Prospects
Currently, the [[User experience with Firebase Studio | user experience with Firebase Studio]] can be overwhelming for non-technical users, featuring a complex UI with many files and buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. However, this is anticipated to improve.

The overall sentiment is that while [[Firebase Studios features and limitations | Firebase Studio]] may not be perfect today, it holds immense [[Future of AI coding tools and their development potential | future potential and developments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. It is recommended for users to experiment with it now, understanding its current limitations, but keeping in mind its significant potential in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.

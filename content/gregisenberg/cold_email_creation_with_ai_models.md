Leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of cold email campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A key strategy involves pitting these AIs against each other to drive better, more refined outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

## The "AI Jealousy" Method

The core of this strategy is to make LLMs "jealous" of each other, leading them to produce higher-quality content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This method can yield results five times better than using a single AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Steps for Enhanced Cold Email Creation

1.  **Open Multiple LLMs Simultaneously**: Instead of relying on a single AI, open two, three, or four LLMs at once for the same task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
2.  **Initial Prompting**: Provide the same initial prompt to each LLM. For instance, to create a cold email for an agency specializing in designing AI interfaces, the prompt could be: "I want to create a cold email for my agency LCA, the premier design firm designing AI interfaces. But I want to make it a cold email that will stand out. Can you help me do this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
3.  **Critique and Compare Initial Outputs**: Review the responses from each AI.
    *   **Grok's Example**: An initial draft from Grok was deemed "not bad," focusing on intuitive AI interfaces and offering a call to action for a 15-minute call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. It was rated a 9 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
    *   **ChatGPT's Example**: ChatGPT's initial draft included a subject line like "Your AI deserves better design" and a call to action for a quick "tear down" or "loom" video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This was rated as "kind of average" and a 5 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
4.  **Introduce Competition**: Take the "better" output (e.g., Grok's) and present it to the "average" performing LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) while disparaging its own performance. For example, tell ChatGPT: "Grock crushed it and was a nine on 10. Chat GBT was kind of average and was five on 10. I thought you were the better LLM. What's going on?" Then, share Grok's version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
5.  **Refine and Iterate**: The "challenged" LLM will then often produce a significantly improved version.
    *   **ChatGPT's Improved Output**: After being "pitted against" Grok, ChatGPT generated a 9.5 out of 10 email, incorporating specific feedback about the agency's "punchier" and "fresher" voice, and mentioning collaborations with companies like [[automating_your_marketing_with_ai | Slack]], Grammarly, and Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. This revised email focused on making AI feel "magical, not mechanical" and earning trust on first use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
6.  **Repeat with Other LLMs**: Continue the process by feeding the best current output to other LLMs (e.g., Claude), implying they underperformed. This constant competition drives further refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. Modern LLMs have a larger "context window" and can understand user identity, allowing for more personalized and effective outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.

This method of making LLMs compete against each other is a powerful hack to maximize their output for tasks like [[cold_emailing_and_outbound_marketing_with_ai | cold emailing and outbound marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

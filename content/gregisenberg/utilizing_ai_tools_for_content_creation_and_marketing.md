The perception of what AI can do for companies has significantly changed, with tools like ChatGPT Pro shifting views from mere interest to a mix of excitement, worry, and overwhelming potential within the last eight weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This shift highlights a new era for business building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## AI as a Cost-Effective "Employee"

Instead of hiring a first employee for thousands of dollars a month, businesses should consider paying $200 a month for ChatGPT Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The speaker acknowledges that eight weeks prior, he didn't believe this, but using the tools in his business has changed his mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A striking example is recreating a white paper study that cost $35,000 and took three months, using ChatGPT 3 (03) in just 10 minutes, yielding a better result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

> [!info] The "One-Person Billion-Dollar Business"
> The aspiration for a one-person, billion-dollar business is becoming more realistic with the help of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The goal for small businesses and individual entrepreneurs is to leverage AI to feel like they have a 10-person team when they're a one-person company, or a 50-person team when they're a 10-person company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This allows for significant productivity gains, enabling businesses to be "big even if you're small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

A tweet from Thiago Forte encapsulates this feeling, stating that $320 per month on AI tools like ChatGPT Pro, Claude Max, and Notebook LM provides the productivity equivalent of hundreds of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## [[automating_content_creation_with_ai | Automating Content Creation]] and Audience Building

A primary use of AI in business is for audience building through content creation.
First, focus on getting content ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. While humans can generate ideas, AI makes it easier to consistently produce "banging content ideas" daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### Idea Generation

To generate content ideas, one can prompt ChatGPT Pro (using model 4.5 for initial prompts) to scour platforms like Reddit for interesting, validated stories within a niche, filtering for popular posts (e.g., 100 upvotes or more, 40 comments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This creates a database of engaging content, which humans can then add their unique "spin" to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. This approach turns ChatGPT Pro into a "junior researcher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, speeding up research that previously took much longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

### Content Execution

Once ideas are generated, AI can assist with execution. For example, to write a long tweet or content piece, one can outline the main points and then prompt ChatGPT to write the content for editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. There's also a significant opportunity for AI in scriptwriting for faceless videos, by taking existing successful content (e.g., a viral tweet) and having ChatGPT script it for a specific audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.

## "Vibe Marketing" and Full Automation

The concept of "vibe marketing" involves figuring out a manual process for content creation and then automating it completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. This means eventually, one can simply "press the go button" to generate content, transforming into an influencer with a machine-driven operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. While this sounds like science fiction, it's believed to be the direction AI is heading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

## Impact on Business Operations: Efficiency and Downsizing

The prevailing narrative is that AI is not solely about downsizing, but rather about "dramatically maxing out the people who are there already" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, some CEOs are using AI to "get more done with the same or smaller team," which implicitly leads to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Major companies like Duolingo and Shopify have publicly stated they will not hire external contractors and that all employees must learn AI tools, making AI proficiency an entry requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This indicates a restriction on hiring and potential downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

Businesses are encouraged to examine every aspect of their operations – customer acquisition, marketing, sales, fulfillment, engineering, design – and identify repeatable tasks that can be plugged into AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## [[using_ai_for_ad_creation | AI in Ad Creation]] and Prototyping

[[using_ai_for_ad_creation | Creating and optimizing marketing content using AI]] extends to areas like Facebook ads, which are traditionally time-consuming to create, requiring designers, videographers, and ad managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. AI tools, including ChatGPT and new imaging tools, allow for prototyping hundreds of ad variations to test what works before significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. This includes using AI to determine product colors by generating ad images and observing engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

For video ads, tools like Arcads and Icon.com are emerging, capable of creating winning ads with AI actors that are indistinguishable from real people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.

## Mastering AI Tools: The Importance of Prompts

Initial attempts to use AI tools might yield "crappy" or generic results, leading to the misconception that they "don't work for my business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. The key is to learn how to use the tools effectively, as results significantly improve with a better understanding of how the machine works and how to prompt it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. For image generation, a useful hack is to ask AI (like ChatGPT) to reverse-engineer an existing image or ad to provide the exact prompt needed to recreate its look and feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

> [!tip] AI Tool Hierarchy
> ChatGPT can be seen as the "top of the triangle" for AI tools, but it can also recommend specialized tools for individual use cases. For example, if ChatGPT's image generation isn't sufficient for ads, one can ask it to recommend other highly-rated AI ad image generation tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.

## The Arbitrage Opportunity: Current Low Costs

The current phase of AI adoption presents an "insane arbitrage opportunity" due to the low cost of these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. Tools like Arcads and Icon, which are crucial for business growth through effective advertising, might be unknown even to experienced marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. It's speculated that these tools will become more expensive in the future, similar to how early Uber rides were cheap and later became more costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. This suggests a "special period" to go "hardcore" on learning and implementing AI while it's still affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

## Business Model: AI Workflow Agencies

A highly needed and potentially profitable short-term business idea (for the next three years) is an agency that helps other businesses, especially small ones, properly integrate and use AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. This service could involve a "six-week sprint" to diagnose AI implementation opportunities and set up systems, turning a 10-person team into a 100-person team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>. This resembles starting a social media agency during the rise of social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.

The main benefit of starting such an agency is not just the immediate profit, but the opportunity to learn workflows and tools under pressure, getting paid to become proficient, which can then be applied to one's own software products or ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. It's crucial for such an agency to niche down, targeting specific industries like finance or law firms, or small businesses, especially those whose owners might be less familiar with rapidly evolving AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.

## The Human Element: Editor Role and Learnable Skills

The future role of the founder is akin to an editor of a newspaper, not necessarily writing every article, but curating, refining, and directing the AI's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This "taste" or intuition is crucial for making the content unique and special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. While AI can gather data, like popular Reddit posts to understand what resonates, the human element adds the unique spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

The ability to control and effectively use AI tools is 100% learnable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. The difference between those who succeed and those who don't is mastering the tools, understanding their nuances, and being okay with them not being perfect initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. Just as different musicians yield different results from the same instrument, mastery of AI tools leads to vastly different outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

## Conclusion: AI as a Habit

To leverage AI effectively, it should become an ingrained habit. This means intentionally using AI for every task, having AI tools (like ChatGPT) constantly open alongside work, similar to keeping water on a desk to encourage hydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. This integration ensures continuous improvement and adaptation to the evolving landscape of AI-powered business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.

Hunter Isacson, a creator of consumer apps with over 300 million downloads, shares his playbook for achieving significant revenue, including reaching $1 million MRR in consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. His apps include NGL, which garnered 250 million downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, and other apps with 60-70 million downloads, like a dating app and a crypto app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Isacson believes there's a current opportunity in consumer AI and mobile apps to build startups and generate revenue without needing venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Leveraging Creators and Influencers for Growth

A key strategy for app growth, particularly for consumer social and AI apps, involves [[leveraging_creators_and_influencer_partnerships_for_business_growth | leveraging creators and influencers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Isacson's approach focuses on using [[strategies_for_media_and_content_creation | TikTok and Instagram content]] to initially "seed" the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### Case Study: NGL
NGL achieved a quarter of a billion downloads with less than $10,000 spent on marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. The marketing's purpose was solely to seed the app, allowing it to go "giga viral" once enough people downloaded it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. This success was partly due to Instagram's October 2021 update, which allowed all users to post links without a 10,000-follower requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. NGL capitalized on this new channel, training hundreds of millions of people on how to use Instagram's link sticker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

### Organic vs. Paid Seeding
While NGL used small payments ($50-$100) to influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>, the goal is to develop things that scale based on a small initial effort, aiming for a single viral video to kickstart traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. This highlights the [[importance_of_organic_growth_and_audience_building | importance of organic growth]], even if initiated by some paid seeding.

## Hunter Isacson's Playbook for Building a $1 Million/Month App Business

Hunter Isacson's methodology for building successful consumer apps focuses on simplicity, user engagement, and strategic growth loops.

> [!tip] Hunter Isacson's Playbook
> 1.  **Build a Simple Experience**: Start with a bare-bones Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that solves a core problem, even if it's not fully optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
> 2.  **Build a Brand People Love**:
>     *   Use short, easily understandable names that resonate with the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
>     *   Leverage slang or terms from a specific community to set a relatable, comfortable, and "young" tone (e.g., NGL for "Not Gonna Lie," Bags for crypto "bags") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.
>     *   Maintain an authentic voice in public communication and social media, making the brand memeable and relatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.
> 3.  **Get Users On Quickly**: Test content on platforms like TikTok or Instagram Reels even during pre-order to see if people respond to the app's premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
> 4.  **Select a Core Action and Northstar Metric**: Identify a single key action users must complete (e.g., share a link, get a match, make a trade) and orient all decisions around maximizing the percentage of users who complete it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. This metric should guide tradeoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
>     *   **Wink (Make New Friends App)**: Percentage of users getting a match on their first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
>     *   **NGL (Anonymous Messaging)**: Percentage of users sharing the link and a few replies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
>     *   **Bags (Crypto App)**: Number of people funding accounts and making one trade on the first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
>     *   Aim for over 90% completion rate for the core action in a single, unbranched user flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.
> 5.  **Integrate Sharing/Inviting into the Core Action**: Include a sharing or inviting mechanism directly within the main user flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. This creates a "K-factor" or viral loop, reducing reliance on external marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. Examples include NGL's link sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a> and Bags' Twitter login and sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.
> 6.  **Continuously Seed and Expand**: Once the core action conversion is proven, apply more pressure by seeding the app in different audiences, niches, countries, and time zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

## Capitalizing on New Channels and Features

Successful apps often identify and exploit new functionalities within existing platforms.

### Locket and Widgets
Locket became a mainstream use case for iPhone widgets by making them social <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. It allowed users to take a picture that would appear on a friend's home screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This demonstrated the power of adapting to new platform features.

### Future Opportunities in the Apple Ecosystem
New iOS versions regularly introduce "new real estate to play with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Hunter identifies potential for growth in:
*   **Live Activities**: The dynamic lock screen notifications (e.g., Uber tracking) that are currently underutilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Lock Screen Widgets**: Despite being common, their social experiences have not been fully explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
The speaker predicts significant "bangers" (highly successful apps) emerging from these areas in the next 6-12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Beyond the Playbook: Inspiration & Future Trends

### Leveraging Existing Ideas with New Form Factors
Many successful apps don't invent entirely new concepts but instead adapt existing popular ideas to new channels or technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   **Cali**: A calorie-tracking app that existed before, but Cali made it "AI first" by packaging publicly available AI tools with a good onboarding experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Hallow**: A Christian/Catholic prayer app that digitized and made religious content more colorful and appealing to younger generations with push notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. It focuses on a strong single-player experience with daily content and adds multiplayer through community challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Pangu**: A virtual pet app that injects advanced AI into the concept, offering a more human-like experience with an AI companion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.
This "X for Y" framework involves identifying existing successful formats and applying them to new niches or technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

### Future Technologies
Hunter Isacson is particularly interested in:
*   **Consumer Crypto Apps**: With increasing regulation and mainstream acceptance, there's excitement around building consumer-friendly crypto applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
*   **Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses**: The potential for AR glasses to create fully immersive, shareable experiences, potentially driven by phone-based computing, is a significant future step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.
*   **Local AI Models on Phones**: The possibility of AI models running directly on phones, enabling more advanced mobile experiences, is a trend to watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

### Why Focus on Consumer Apps
For young individuals, building consumer mobile apps is seen as the best path for learning about human psychology, product development, and achieving global viral success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. The tools for building consumer apps are also rapidly improving, potentially eliminating the need for technical expertise in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>. This focus on consumer products is considered more "fun" than B2B or SaaS due to its emphasis on product love and mass appeal over contracts and business dealings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

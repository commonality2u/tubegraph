Joseph Choy discusses strategies for building [[building_consumer_mobile_apps | viral consumer apps]], emphasizing TikTok as a significantly "underpriced distribution Channel" for acquiring users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. He notes a trend where apps are achieving millions of downloads and substantial monthly recurring revenue (MRR) by mastering TikTok content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Leveraging E-commerce Marketing Tactics
Many successful strategies for consumer apps are adapted from the e-commerce space, especially after TikTok Shop launched in November 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

### Mass UGC Creators and Content Production
E-commerce brands like Tabs Chocolate achieved significant revenue by employing "mass UGC creators," often teenagers, to "mass-produce content every single day" for TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This approach can be applied to consumer SaaS, offering higher margins (90%+) compared to e-commerce (20-30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

### TikTok Content Formats
While short-form video is often associated with TikTok, carousel slideshows using AI-generated images (e.g., Midjourney) are highly effective and easier to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. These can use strong hooks (e.g., "POV you divorced bread") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a> or controversial narratives (e.g., wedding rules) to go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. The POV app, a disposable camera app, successfully uses this slideshow format with wedding-themed stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:05]</a>.

Although slideshows may have a lower conversion rate than talking-head videos due to less human connection, they offer greater scale and a lower barrier to entry for content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

## Unlocking Opportunity: TikTok Shop Affiliate Creators
There's a significant opportunity in targeting [[aipowered_mobile_apps_and_startups | TikTok Shop affiliate creators]] who are already skilled at generating views and sales for physical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

*   **Finding Creators**: The TikTok Shop Affiliate Center provides data on top-selling products and creators by industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.
*   **Shifting Focus**: These creators, currently incentivized to sell e-commerce products, could be promoting apps instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.
*   **App as Utility**: Apps can integrate seamlessly into existing product review content. For example, a skincare analysis app could be used by a creator to show before-and-after results when reviewing a skincare product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>. This provides a utility for the creator and can lead to free marketing, as influencers might use the app to enhance their existing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.
*   **Lower Conversion Friction**: It's easier for consumers to "double click to download an app and spend five bucks" than to commit $100 to an unknown e-commerce product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>. [[AI apps generating significant monthly revenue | Consumer apps]] often monetize through weekly or annual subscriptions (e.g., $2/week or $30-$60/year) with near-zero cost of goods, making them highly scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>. The "Double Tap to Pay" UX change via Apple Pay has significantly boosted iOS subscription revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>.

## High Lifetime Value (LTV) Niches

While TikTok is often associated with younger demographics, there are lucrative niches with older, wealthier users willing to pay for premium services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>.

### 1. Golfers
Golfers are a demographic with high disposable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>.
*   **Opportunity**: [[ai_app_startups_and_ideas | AI golf swing analysis apps]] that use a phone's camera to analyze swing mechanics (angle, speed) and provide tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24:00">[23:24:00]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition**: A top app in this niche reportedly makes $70,000 a month from 10,000 downloads, indicating a high revenue-per-download ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>. This offers a compelling alternative to expensive in-person coaching ($125 for 60 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:00">[25:08:00]</a>.
*   **Content Inspiration**: Apps can emulate the visual analysis (e.g., wireframe skeletons over movements) seen in existing viral sports content like the KO MMA training app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:35:00">[26:35:00]</a>. This visual wow factor works well on TikTok and can be applied to other sports like tennis, pickleball, or skiing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:00">[27:29:00]</a>. GPT Vision's recent advancements make AI-powered analysis more accessible via smartphone cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:00">[28:25:00]</a>.

### 2. Poker Players
Poker players are considered ideal customers due to their willingness to invest in improving their game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:20]</a>.
*   **Opportunity**: Develop apps that analyze hand history, strategies, or provide real-time odds and betting advice. Educational components for beginners can also be highly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:47:00">[29:47:00]</a>.
*   **Monetization Gap**: Many poker content creators on TikTok post unmonetized or under-monetized videos, often promoting gambling sites or expensive courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>. An app could be subtly integrated into gameplay videos, flashing an interface for a few seconds to prompt comments and downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:12]</a>.

## TikTok Distribution and Creator Strategy
The nature of TikTok's "For You Page" algorithm means content is discovered by new audiences, not primarily through followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:47:00">[33:47:00]</a>.

*   **Creators as Actors**: Instead of hiring influencers with large audiences and giving them creative freedom (which can lead to ineffective ads), brands can hire creators simply as "talent" (actors) for videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a>. These creators can have zero followers and still achieve viral reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:46:00">[35:46:00]</a>.
*   **Multiple Brand Accounts**: A common strategy is to create new brand accounts for each creator or content format, optimizing for the algorithm to target specific audiences. Examples include Tabs Chocolate and Airbuds, which use multiple accounts like "Lila Airbuds" or "Stacy Airbuds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17:00">[36:17:00]</a>. This prevents the algorithm from getting "confused" by too many different faces or content styles on a single account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:19:00">[40:19:00]</a>.
*   **[[Creating a Brand for Apps | Niche-Specific Content]]**: An app like Locks Club (a dating app for Jewish people) creates highly niche content (e.g., "how to find a nice Jewish boy in NYC") that resonates deeply with its target audience and can go viral on new accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:55:00">[37:55:00]</a>.

## Capitalizing on "Cult Movements"
High-value [[yc_startups_and_ai_niche_opportunities | niche market strategies for AI SaaS startups]] can involve identifying and productizing apps around existing deep internet movements or "cults" that haven't yet been served by dedicated products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:58:00">[40:58:00]</a>.

### Framework: Health, Wealth, Relationships
These are the three fundamental desires people seek to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[43:55:00]</a>.

*   **Looksmaxing (Relationships/Self-Improvement)**:
    *   **Movement**: A deep internet movement focused on men improving their physical appearance to address insecurities and challenges with dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:16:00">[41:16:00]</a>.
    *   **App Example**: Umax, an [[aipowered_mobile_apps_and_startups | AI-powered app]], scans a user's face, provides scores, and offers tips to improve features like jawline, skin, and hair. It generates millions in annual revenue by capitalizing on this ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>.

*   **Wealth/Making Money (Wealth)**:
    *   **Movement**: Teenagers and young people seeking ways to earn money online, particularly through short-form content platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:40:00">[44:40:00]</a>.
    *   **App Example**: Crayo, a [[productized_services_for_high_ltv_software | productized service]], automates the process of clipping and mass-posting streamer content to generate income, replacing expensive courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:25:00">[45:25:00]</a>. It reportedly has over $5 million in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:40:00">[44:40:00]</a>.

## Importance of Product Quality
While distribution is key, the underlying product must be high quality and retain users. Before scaling marketing, ensure the app is not a "leaky bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:27:00">[47:27:00]</a>.
*   **Metrics**: Understand user retention and churn rates to determine Lifetime Value (LTV) and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:49:00">[47:49:00]</a>. A good product with strong retention allows for more aggressive marketing spend and better marketing efficacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:01:00">[48:01:00]</a>.
*   **Scalability and Retention**: The primary advantage of consumer apps is their scalability and ability to retain users through subscriptions, unlike single-purchase e-commerce products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:26:00">[48:26:00]</a>.

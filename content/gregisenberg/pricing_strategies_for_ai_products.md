## Foundational Philosophy

Before determining a [[pricing_strategies_for_ai_coding_platforms | pricing strategy]], companies should decide their core identity and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A guiding principle for successful companies is that they make money to create better services, rather than making services solely to generate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. While it's possible to build a successful company with a more "mercenary" approach, the most successful companies globally tend to hold the former view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Value-Based Pricing for AI

For AI companies, a clear [[pricing_strategies_for_ai_coding_platforms | pricing strategy]] can be derived from the value proposition:
*   **Quantify Human Input Saved** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>: Evaluate the amount of human effort an AI solution saves. This includes not just salary but also emotional burden or frustration associated with manual tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>. Even short tasks that are highly annoying can justify a higher price due to the emotional damage saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.
*   **Apply a Discount Factor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>: After calculating the total human cost saved (monetary and emotional), apply a significant discount (e.g., 50% to 80%) because the work is performed by a machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. This creates a "no-brainer offer" for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

For example, an individual might pay an AI agent significant money to book flights, hotels, or restaurants, recognizing the time and effort saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Similarly, companies use AI for tasks like enhanced due diligence in financial crime, customer service, or compliance, automating repetitive and painful work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Flexibility in Pricing

Contrary to some conventional wisdom, it is possible to increase prices after initial launch if a product delivers significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.
*   **Building a Loved Product** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>: If a product is beautiful, loved by users, and holds a valuable place in their lives, they are often willing to pay more later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.
*   **User Acclimation to Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>: Companies like Uber and Lyft initially offered services at a low cost to "hook" users. Once users were accustomed to the product and integrated into the network, prices could be incrementally increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.
*   **Focus on Value, Not Just Price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>: Customers tend to remember the value they receive more than the exact price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. If great value is created, companies can find the "efficient frontier" of their [[pricing_strategies_for_ai_coding_platforms | pricing strategies]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. AI can potentially assist in determining this efficient frontier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

An example is Monzo, a Neo Bank, which initially had problems due to not charging enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. After revenue streams were impacted by external events (like COVID-19 reducing debit card use overseas), the company began charging for services like a fourth ATM withdrawal or replacement cards. This was met with understanding from customers who felt the product was fair and had previously been received for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>. This demonstrates that if a product is valued, users accept fair [[subscription_models_and_pricing_strategies | pricing strategies]] adjustments.

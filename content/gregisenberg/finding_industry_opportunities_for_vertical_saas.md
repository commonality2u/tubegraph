[[Building a Vertical SaaS Business | Vertical SaaS]] refers to industry-specific software designed to address the unique needs of a particular market segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Luke Sfinos, an advisor to Atomic, which builds billion-dollar businesses like Him & Hers, shares a step-by-step approach to identifying and building successful [[Building a Vertical SaaS Business | vertical SaaS]] businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While the concept might seem "boring," it presents significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Why Focus on Vertical SaaS?

Historically, early software use cases were always tied to businesses, aiming to optimize, create efficiency, save costs, save time, or lift revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Over the last 10-15 years, many founders shifted away from industry-specific software to chase broader, multi-billion dollar "unicorn" opportunities, often driven by venture capital (VC) desires for massive market sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. However, this led to many failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Vertical SaaS offers the opportunity to build enduring, strong businesses with high retention, even if they don't always have the explosive growth rates VCs typically seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Focusing on one specific industry allows for tailored software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## The Scientific Approach to Identifying Opportunities

[[Building a Vertical SaaS Business | Vertical SaaS]] is more of a science than an art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The first step is to pick an industry, not an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Key Industry Characteristics

To find a good industry for [[Building a Vertical SaaS Business | vertical SaaS]], evaluate the following characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>:

1.  **Market Size (Revenue)**: How much revenue do companies in the industry generate? For example, General Medical and Surgical Hospitals do nearly a trillion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
2.  **Number of Companies**: How many companies are in that industry? This indicates market fragmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   Industries with few companies (e.g., 2,500 for Surgical Hospitals) are often enterprise-driven, requiring extensive product features and making sales difficult for bootstrapped startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
3.  **Segmentation**: The best markets have a healthy mix of small businesses (doing a few million a year), mid-market businesses (doing $10-100 million), and enterprise businesses (over $100 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. It's easier to start with SMBs due to less feature requirements, then grow to serve mid-market and enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

An example of a promising industry is **Machine Shops**:
*   Approximately $240 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   Around 22,000 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   Beautifully segmented with a healthy amount of small, mid-market, and some enterprise businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   Average machine shop does $2 million a year in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Addressing Lack of Domain Expertise

It's not a prerequisite to have prior domain expertise in an industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Luke Sfinos, for example, built a significant [[Building a Vertical SaaS Business | vertical SaaS]] business in trade schools without prior knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Success involves learning everything possible about the chosen industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Deep Dive into Industry Operations

After selecting an industry, the next crucial step is to map out the entire customer journey and end-to-end operations of businesses within that industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. This helps identify where software opportunities exist and their potential size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

*   **Examples of Operational Mapping**:
    *   **Toast (Restaurants)**: Visualized every aspect of a restaurant, from back office to kitchen, delivery, bar, and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
    *   **Corsky (Trade Schools)**: Mapped out admissions, training (often in garages with real equipment), IT, student services, compliance, and placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

This approach flips the typical software-first mindset by understanding the physical and operational components of an industry, then identifying where software can create efficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

### Identifying Pain Points and Opportunities

After mapping operations, analyze where software can provide solutions:

1.  **Paper Processes**: Many industries, even in 2024, still rely on manual, paper-based workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. These represent clear opportunities for digitization. Examples in machine shops include job tracking, scheduling, tooling/inventory logs, and machine maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.
2.  **Horizontal Software Solutions**: Businesses often stitch together generic, non-industry-specific software (e.g., general CRMs, project management tools like Trello or Asana, spreadsheets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. This fragmentation indicates a demand for an all-in-one, industry-specific solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.
3.  **Lack of AI Leverage**: Industries may not be utilizing AI for tasks like predictive maintenance, optimized job scheduling, automated quality control, or energy management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. These represent opportunities for [[Framework for identifying AI SaaS startup ideas | AI-powered SaaS]] solutions.

#### Using AI for Initial Research
AI tools like ChatGPT can serve as a research assistant for initial desk research:
*   **Market Size & Segmentation**: Ask about the market size and segmentation of a specific industry (e.g., "tell me about the market size and segmentation in the United States for machine shops") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.
*   **Operational Workflow**: Prompt AI to describe the end-to-end operation of a business within that industry (e.g., "walk me through what a machine shop's operation would look like end to end") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **Existing Software & Gaps**: Inquire about prevalent software solutions and tie them back to the operational process, specifically asking about areas still using pen and paper, lacking AI, or relying on multiple horizontal solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

While AI is a powerful assistant for initial research, it's critical to **validate** all findings by directly engaging with businesses in the industry, for example, by shadowing operations or offering to buy them lunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

### Financial Analysis: Following the Money

Obtain and analyze Profit & Loss (P&L) statements from as many businesses in the target industry as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Publicly traded companies in the sector or industry-focused bankers can be valuable sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

The goal is to understand where companies are spending money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Software solutions should focus on:
1.  **Increasing Revenue** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
2.  **Decreasing Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
3.  **Preventing Customer Churn** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
4.  **Maintaining Compliance** (especially in highly regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

Look for areas where human effort can be automated by software, and evaluate existing software investments to understand what they deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

## Analyzing Competition

Before building, study existing software solutions in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Common scenarios include:
*   **Legacy Providers**: Old, all-encompassing ERP systems that are 30+ years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Fragmented Horizontal Solutions**: Businesses piecing together general-purpose software not tailored to their industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Paper Processes**: Despite being 2024, many industries still rely on manual, paper-based systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

It's crucial to look at each operational bucket and understand what processes are being used, rather than just searching for "industry software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

## Go-to-Market Strategy Considerations

A great product without users is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. Before investing significant time, understand and be comfortable with the [[Effective GotoMarket Strategy for Vertical SaaS | go-to-market strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>.

*   **Study Successful Companies**: Research how existing [[Building a Vertical SaaS Business | vertical SaaS]] companies in that space acquired their first 10, 100, or 1,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
*   **Sales-Led vs. Product-Led/Marketing-Led**: Many industries, especially blue-collar ones, traditionally rely on heavy outside sales models, involving relationship building and in-person meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. Venture capitalists prefer product-led or marketing-led acquisition due to faster growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. Sales-led models often require massive average contract values (ACVs) to build large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Media/Social**: Consider whether media creation, newsletters, or social media engagement can be effective distribution channels for the specific industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.

## The Importance of Wedge Products

A [[importance_of_wedge_products_in_vertical_saas | wedge product]] is a "get in the door" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. While the ultimate goal for [[Building a Vertical SaaS Business | vertical SaaS]] is often to be the all-in-one solution, no one starts there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.

A good [[importance_of_wedge_products_in_vertical_saas | wedge product]] should:
*   Address an area that's currently on paper or has poor competition, but is highly important to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   Be easy to implement and deploy quickly (not a 12-month process) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
*   Serve as a "reputation prover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

**Case Study: Roofer.com**
Roofer.com, a software company for roofing businesses, started with a free proposal tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. This tool allowed roofing companies to generate real-time quotes using Google Maps data, digitalizing a previously awkward, manual process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. Roofer.com monetized by taking a percentage of bookings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. This enabled them to acquire customers via digital marketing (Instagram, Facebook ads), which is uncommon in home services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. After establishing trust, they then introduced a CRM and are likely moving towards an all-in-one solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

A successful [[importance_of_wedge_products_in_vertical_saas | wedge product]] increases customer trust, making it easier to upsell additional software solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

## Integrating Payments for Scale

Adding payment processing to a [[Building a Vertical SaaS Business | vertical SaaS]] solution is a key strategy for building massive companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. Owning the transaction significantly expands the total addressable market and revenue potential.

*   **Toast Example**: If Toast (restaurant software) only charged a monthly SaaS fee, their market size would be limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>. By implementing payments and taking a percentage of every transaction, they tap into the trillion-dollar revenue flowing through US restaurants, dramatically increasing their market size and valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.
*   **Corsky Example**: Corsky integrated payments for trade schools, who were previously using PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>. By offering a seamless payment experience within their existing student management app, they streamlined operations and captured the transaction volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.

If a [[importance_of_wedge_products_in_vertical_saas | wedge product]] is built before or after the transaction, it eventually allows capturing the transaction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>.

## Pricing Strategies for Vertical SaaS

[[Pricing Strategies for Vertical SaaS | Pricing]] is often overlooked but is critical for software businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. A basic but effective approach is to understand the monetary cost of the problem being solved for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>.

*   **ROI-Based Pricing**:
    *   **Example (Student Retention Tool)**: For trade schools, student retention was a major problem, costing millions in lost tuition revenue (e.g., $20,000 tuition per student, losing 30% of students) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
    *   A tool that analyzes academic and attendance data to identify at-risk students and automatically texts them with resources provides a clear ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>.
    *   If the software saves just a few students, it generates significant revenue for the school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.
    *   Price the product as a portion of the demonstrated ROI (e.g., aiming for 50% of the value provided) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.

Only build products that demonstrably increase revenue, decrease costs, prevent customer churn, or help with compliance, as these areas offer clear, measurable ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.

Sequential prompting is an advanced technique for using AI tools that involves a multi-step process where the output from one AI model is used as the input for another, creating a chain of AI interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. This method allows for the creation of complex workflows and sophisticated outputs, often leading to revenue-generating products and automated business processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

## Understanding Sequential Prompting

Traditional AI prompting often involves either conversational back-and-forth with a tool like [[introduction_to_ai_prompting_and_reasoning_models | Chat GPT]] or using a single "master prompt" for a solid output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Sequential prompting introduces a third layer, where [[introduction_to_ai_prompting_and_reasoning_models | Chat GPT]] is used to generate a *new prompt* that is then fed into a *different* AI tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This process can be extended through multiple AI tools, akin to connecting "Lego bricks" of AI capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### The Workflow Principle
The core principle is to use [[introduction_to_ai_prompting_and_reasoning_models | Chat GPT]] to intelligently craft prompts for other specialized AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. For example, [[introduction_to_ai_prompting_and_reasoning_models | Chat GPT]] can analyze an image and generate a detailed text prompt, which is then used by an image generation AI like Leonardo AI to create consistent characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

Initially, it's recommended to perform this process manually to allow for rapid iteration and fine-tuning of prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. Once satisfied with the outputs, the workflow can be automated using APIs and [[creating_aipowered_automation_workflows | automation tools]] like Zapier or Make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. For more complex integrations, a developer or engineer might be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Tools Used in Sequential Prompting Workflows

*   **[[introduction_to_ai_prompting_and_reasoning_models | Chat GPT]]/[[automating_workflows_with_ai_tools_like_mcp_nadn_and_claude | Claude AI]]**: Used to generate initial prompts, analyze images, and craft narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. [[introduction_to_ai_prompting_and_reasoning_models | Chat GPT]] can even be asked to generate a prompt for itself or other tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Leonardo AI**: An image generation tool that takes detailed prompts to create high-quality, Disney-style images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. It has an API for programmatic image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>.
*   **Cling AI**: Converts static images into animated videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. It can also dub audio and perform lip-syncing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
*   **11 Labs**: Used for generating voiceovers to complement animated videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Remove BG**: A tool that automatically removes image backgrounds, useful for creating stickers or transparent assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. It also offers an API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.
*   **Printful**: A print-on-demand service that can be integrated via API to automate the printing and fulfillment of physical products like stickers or clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

## Business Opportunities and Applications

Sequential prompting enables the creation of various [[using_ai_for_creating_steps_in_startup_projects | startup ideas]] and scalable businesses with minimal overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### AI-First Personalized Content
The ability to generate consistent characters and scenes through sequential prompting opens doors for creating personalized content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

*   **Personalized Greeting Cards/Stories (e.g., Moonpig 2.0)**:
    *   Users upload a photo, and [[introduction_to_ai_prompting_and_reasoning_models | Chat GPT]] generates a detailed character prompt based on the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
    *   Leonardo AI then uses this prompt to create cartoon-style images of the person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
    *   Stories can be generated around these characters, turning cards into mini-stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.
    *   Options include adding animated videos and voiceovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.
    *   This model can generate significant revenue through premium card sales and monthly memberships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.
    *   An early concept for such a product was "Teeny Tales," designed with a user-friendly interface for creating personalized stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.

*   **Meme Generation**: Rapidly create customized memes featuring personalized characters or reacting to trending topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

### Educational Content
Sequential prompting can be applied to create engaging educational materials:

*   **Interactive Learning Stories**: Generate stories and images based on specific curriculum topics (e.g., Romans) to make learning more engaging for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. This could be a B2B (Business-to-School) model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

### Personalized Physical Products
Connecting AI workflows with print-on-demand services allows for automated physical product creation:

*   **Personalized Stickers**:
    *   Generate AI avatar images of individuals (e.g., teachers or students) in various poses or scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.
    *   Use Remove BG to create transparent background images (PNGs) suitable for stickers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.
    *   Integrate with Printful or similar APIs for automated printing and shipping of physical stickers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
    *   This could be marketed directly to schools as an incentive for students or as personalized items for staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>.

## The Shift in Business Paradigm

AI, coupled with the cultural shift towards remote work and the technical shift in product development, has transformed business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

*   **Product Development**: Products can be built instantly at low cost with zero employees, eliminating the need for extensive VC capital or large engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: Marketing has shifted from seasonal campaigns to "always-on" storytelling, especially driven by solopreneurs who share their journey and engage audiences daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Operations**: Remote working negates the need for physical office spaces and allows for lean teams, accelerating product cycles and reducing overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

This new paradigm allows individuals to perform the work of multiple traditional roles (e.g., content writer, graphic designer, social media manager) using AI tools, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

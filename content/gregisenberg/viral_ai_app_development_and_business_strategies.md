The landscape of app development is rapidly evolving, with AI playing a significant role in creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs. This article explores strategies for building viral AI apps, drawing insights from successful examples and discussing practical business approaches.

## Prioritizing Personal Financial Stability

Sometimes, the focus should be on changing your personal world before attempting to change the global one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Achieving financial stability, such as being able to retire parents, contribute to a cause, or buy a first home, is a commendable goal for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This initial base of capital, referred to as "your first nut," provides a foundation for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Case Study: The Riz App and Plug AI

A prime example of a successful and viral AI app is Riz, an AI dating coach built on top of ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This app was reported to be generating $190,000 per month and had 333,000 downloads monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The founder's idea stemmed from observations within a Tinder subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### The "ChatGPT Wrapper" Model

The success of apps like Riz highlights the potential of what can be called "ChatGPT wrappers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. These are apps that leverage existing AI models like ChatGPT, focusing their application on specific niches. The key to their success often lies more in [[using_marketing_strategies_for_aibased_apps|marketing and branding]] than in unique product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Key elements for a successful ChatGPT wrapper include:
*   **Strong Brand Name**: A memorable and relevant name, like "Riz" (slang for charisma), can significantly drive virality and word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Effective Referral Flows**: Integrating mechanisms within the app that encourage users to invite friends is crucial for [[viral_consumer_app_growth_tactics|viral consumer app growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### A Development Studio's Success

The founder behind "Plug AI" (an AI dating assistant similar to Riz AI, though different companies) leads a small three-person development studio called AI RZ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. At just 23 years old, this founder has launched three apps, collectively closing in on $500,000 per month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

Their portfolio includes:
*   **Plug AI**: A texting assistant for dating, where users can upload screenshots of conversations to get AI-generated pickup lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Astra**: An AI for life advice, covering challenges, compatibility, personal growth, and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Pallet**: An [[AI powered mobile apps and startup ideas|AI-powered mobile app]] that determines a user's color season from a selfie and generates personalized style and makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

This strategy showcases the brilliance of creating "AI coaching" in diverse verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. They avoid building extensive new technology, instead leveraging existing AI capabilities and focusing on strong branding and simple, clear positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Crucially, they are not trying to be an app for everyone, but rather for specific niches like dating coaching or style advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### [[Challenges_and_solutions_in_AI_app_development|Challenges and Solutions in AI App Development]]

While profitable, these apps face the risk of being built on top of platforms like OpenAI, which could change their pricing or terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. However, the substantial revenue generated, even if temporary, allows founders to gain significant business experience and accumulate capital for future ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. The skills learned are transferable to whatever they build next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

Investing in such ventures, even with risks, can be attractive for a profit share rather than traditional equity, acknowledging their focus on immediate profitability rather than a large IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

## The "Anti-Trend" Strategy in App Development

When a trend emerges, an "anti-trend" often follows, presenting unique [[ai_powered_mobile_apps_and_startup_ideas|startup ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

For example, the trend of biohacking and longevity (e.g., Brian Johnson) can be contrasted with an "anti-trend" of embracing hedonism and a shorter, more indulgent life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

Applied to [[using_ai_for_app_development|AI app development]]:
*   While AI coaching and texting apps are trending, there will be an equal demand for human-led services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   These human-led services might command a premium price and potentially represent an even better business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   An AI app like Riz could offer a premium upgrade with human coaching intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   Similarly, for an app like Pallet (AI color season analysis), an "anti-trend" could be a human-led version with direct influencer interaction and personalized voice messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

Anti-trends often come with significantly less competition compared to popular AI-driven markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. When [[implementing_ai_in_app_development_processes|developing AI apps]], it's wise to consider non-obvious use cases, as obvious ones (like dating or therapy) are already saturated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

## Practical Business and Networking Tips

For effective networking and deal-making, especially in business, a simple yet powerful strategy is to offer direct contact via phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This approach signals flexibility and empathy, making it easier for busy individuals to connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Moving discussions to text messaging can elevate the interaction, making it feel more personal and fostering deeper connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This seemingly informal approach can be highly effective, even in closing large corporate deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## New Startup Ideas

Beyond [[growth_hacking_through_ai_apps_and_viral_content|AI app marketing strategies]], new business models continue to emerge. One [[ai_powered_mobile_apps_and_startup_ideas|startup idea]] could be a paid membership called "The 100 Club," focused on achieving perfect sleep scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. This could involve physical products like eye masks or supplements, community sharing of sleep scores, and gamifying the sleep experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. Conversely, an "anti-movement" called "The Zero Club" could cater to those who intentionally don't prioritize sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

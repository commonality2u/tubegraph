Starting a new venture can be daunting [00:00:08], but newsletters are presented as a "cheat code" for launching a profitable business from scratch in 2025 [00:00:19]. They enable building a loyal audience that can serve as a foundation for marketplaces, agencies, and more [00:00:31]. These ideas are inspired by Matt McGary, a "newsletter God" who has acquired 15.4 million email subscribers for clients [00:00:54].

## 1. Marketing Newsletter for Global Talent
This idea addresses the skill gap between Western marketers and overseas talent who often work with smaller budgets [00:02:18].
*   **Idea**: Create a newsletter specifically for overseas marketers seeking remote USA-based marketing jobs [00:02:33].
*   **Newsletter Structure**:
    *   Great remote marketing jobs readers can apply to [00:03:19].
    *   Relevant digital marketing news and updates [00:03:25].
    *   Actionable digital marketing tutorials [00:03:32].
*   **Growth/Subscriber Acquisition**: Acquire subscribers in places like India for 25 to 50 cents each from Facebook ads [00:02:45]. Spending $5,000 a month could yield 20,000 new subscribers monthly [00:02:53].
*   **[[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | Monetization Strategies]]**: The primary monetization target is the Western audience looking to hire talented overseas marketers [00:03:47].
    1.  **Job Board**: Offer a free job board where companies post marketing jobs for overseas talent [00:04:00]. Charge $300-$500 for a "boost" or to feature jobs in the newsletter [00:04:05].
    2.  **Targeted Sponsored Email Blasts**: Collect subscriber data (work experience, job title, company, skills) at signup [00:04:33]. Send targeted sponsored emails on behalf of job advertisers, charging $1,000-$3,000 per recruiting blast [00:04:56].
    3.  **Overseas Recruiting Agency**: Partner with an existing overseas recruiting agency or create your own [00:05:09]. Partnering is considered more feasible [00:05:16].
    4.  **Create a Course**: Focus on the international audience of marketers [00:05:53]. (This is considered the least favorite option by the speaker [00:05:59]).
*   **Math Example**: With a $5,000/month ad budget ($0.25 CPA), acquiring 20,000 new subscribers monthly:
    *   5 jobs/newsletter at $300 each, 3 newsletters/week = $1,500/issue or $18,000/month [00:06:14].
    *   5 recruiting blasts/month at $2,000 each = $10,000/month [00:06:29].
    *   Total potential revenue: ~$28,000/month with 20,000-40,000 international marketers [00:06:37].

## 2. Platform-Based Newsletter
*   **Idea**: Create an educational newsletter instructing people on how to better use a specific tool, platform, or program commonly used in an industry [00:08:20].
*   **Examples**: Ableton (music production), DaVinci (video editing), Notion (operations), Canva (graphics), Figma (design), Klaviyo (e-commerce), Perplexity AI (research) [00:08:31]. Focus on a particular niche, e.g., Perplexity AI for research, not for everyone [00:08:53].
*   **[[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | Monetization Strategies]]**:
    1.  **Affiliate Partner**: Become an affiliate partner for the platform. Affiliates often earn 20-50% recurring commission [00:09:21].
    2.  **Templates**: Create and sell templates related to the platform (e.g., HubSpot templates for $200) [00:09:54]. Offer templates for free if subscribers sign up through your affiliate link [00:10:06].
    3.  **Create a Course**: (Least preferred option by the speaker [00:09:06]).
    4.  **Sell Software**: Build a Software as a Service (SaaS) tool to sell to your audience, especially now with AI coding platforms [00:10:50].

## 3. Unofficial Sports Team Newsletter
*   **Idea**: Find a sports team with a large fanbase but limited media coverage (e.g., a local, minor league, or college team) [00:11:43]. Avoid major teams like the Dallas Cowboys [00:11:54].
*   **Content Sourcing**: Instead of writing original content, curate the best takes from subreddits and forums, linking out to them [00:11:59]. You can also ask contributors to write for your newsletter [00:12:12]. This approach allows for horizontal scaling (creating multiple newsletters) [00:12:22].
*   **[[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | Monetization Strategies]]**:
    *   **Sponsors**: Sell ad spots to relevant sponsors [00:12:31].
    *   **Paid Community**: Create a paid Discord or Facebook community for fans [00:12:34].
*   **Speaker's Take**: While doable, this idea is considered tougher to monetize significantly as it requires managing a dozen or more newsletters to generate serious revenue [00:12:44].

## 4. Local Real Estate Investor Newsletter
This model has proven successful, with examples like Bisnow Media selling for $70 million [00:13:04]. Real estate transactions involve significant money, making the audience valuable [00:13:25].
*   **Idea**: Target local real estate investors in cities with 200,000 to 1 million people [00:13:30].
*   **Content**:
    1.  Discover investment properties via Zillow or local Realtors (can be outsourced or automated with AI) [00:13:50].
    2.  Feature 10-20 high-quality listings per newsletter [00:14:00].
    3.  Enrich listings with potential mortgage rates and forecast potential returns [00:14:07]. Examples include "The Offer Sheet" and "Here.Co" for Airbnb properties [00:14:18].
*   **[[building_an_audience_for_newsletters | Growth/Building an Audience]]**:
    *   **Facebook Ads**: Build subscriber lists with a Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) of $2 or less [00:14:29].
    *   **Local Groups**: Promote the newsletter in local Facebook groups and subreddits by providing value and then linking out [00:14:34].
    *   **Pre- and Post-CTAs**: Use social media (X, Instagram, TikTok) to tease content and drive sign-ups [00:15:01]. Focus on one platform to build an organic audience to reduce reliance on paid ads over time [00:16:28].
*   **[[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | Monetization Strategies]]**:
    *   **Ad Sales**:
        *   **First Sale**: Approach local businesses with 1,000-5,000 subscribers [00:17:18]. Charge a flat fee (e.g., $2,500) for a certain number of clicks (e.g., 500 clicks at $5/click) [00:17:31]. Reinvest upfront fees into ad spend for more subscribers [00:17:54].
        *   **Best Sponsors**: Local businesses with high Lifetime Values (LTVs) that already work with real estate investors (e.g., lawyers, accountants, bankers, insurance brokers) [00:18:00].
        *   **Scaling**: Once 5,000-10,000 subscribers and steady ad revenue are achieved, replicate the model in nearby cities [00:18:12].
    *   **In-Person Events**: Sell seats ($500-$1,000 each) to local real estate investment seminars or events [00:18:29].
    *   **Premium Subscriptions**: Put 50% of property listings behind a paywall for a premium subscription (e.g., $1,000/year) [00:18:40].
*   **Math Example**: Assuming $2 CPA, $5,000/month ad budget (2,500 new subs/month), plus 600 organic subs/month (total 3,100 new subs/month):
    *   3 ads/month at $2,500 each = $7,500/month [00:19:08].
    *   2% of a 5,000-person list purchases a $500 seminar = $50,000 in sales (not including event sponsorships) [00:19:23].
    *   1% of a 5,000-person list converts to a $1,000/year premium subscription = $50,000 ARR [00:19:38].
    *   Total potential revenue: ~$190,000/year with 5,000-10,000 subscribers [00:19:45]. This demonstrates significant revenue is possible with relatively small subscriber numbers [00:20:14].

## 5. Newsletter for B2B Decision Makers
*   **Idea**: Create a newsletter for B2B decision-makers within a specific industry, e.g., CEOs at Fortune 500 oil and gas companies [00:21:15].
*   **Value Proposition**: Sponsors are eager to reach these high-value decision-makers [00:21:09].
*   **[[building_an_audience_for_newsletters | Subscriber Acquisition]] (Tougher)**:
    1.  **Direct Engagement**: Chat with executives in the target industry to understand their "info diet" and what content they want [00:21:28].
    2.  **Network Expansion**: Ask initial contacts for introductions to more people in their network [00:21:40].
    3.  **Hyper-Relevant Content**: Provide analysis and summaries of important press releases, product launches, executive changes, and earning reports [00:21:46]. Summarize information into a 5-10 minute newsletter [00:22:04].
    4.  **Social Media**: Share content on LinkedIn and X to drive newsletter sign-ups [00:22:09].
    5.  **Advertising/Cross-Promos**: Advertise in other newsletters read by the target ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) [00:22:15]. As the audience grows, leverage cross-promotions for free growth [00:22:21].
*   **Data Enrichment**: Use survey forms (e.g., Beehiiv) after people subscribe to collect job title, industry, company, and location data [00:22:31]. This allows for stronger sponsorship pitches by proving the percentage of subscribers that fit the ICP [00:22:52].
*   **[[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | Monetization Strategies]]**: Primarily through sponsorships due to the high value of the audience [00:23:09]. Opportunities also exist for creating software or other products for this audience [00:23:35].

## 6. Niche Ad Examples for Media Buyers
*   **Idea**: Provide niche ad creative examples for media buyers in specific industries (e.g., media companies, SaaS, info products) [00:24:51].
*   **Content Creation**:
    1.  Determine target niches and create a spreadsheet [00:25:24].
    2.  Source high-converting ads from Meta Ad Library (look for long-running ads on high-spending accounts) [00:25:30].
    3.  Select 3-6 ads per niche and add 1-2 sentences of context to each [00:25:43].
*   **[[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | Monetization Strategies]]**:
    *   **Paywall**: Put 80% of content behind a paywall [00:25:57].
    *   **Templates**: Offer Canva templates for each ad that subscribers can download [00:26:01].
    *   **Sponsorships**: Sell sponsorships to advertisers targeting paid marketers [00:26:03].
    *   **Community/Membership/Course**: Sell access to a community, membership, or course for the audience [00:26:08].

## 7. This Week in Memes (Visual Newsletters)
*   **Idea**: Explain the news with memes, creating a visual newsletter that stands out from text-based ones [00:26:51].
*   **Content Creation**:
    1.  Find big stories of the day/week [00:26:55].
    2.  Find a meme that represents or relates to the story [00:26:59].
    3.  Write a witty and concise summary (100-250 words) below the meme [00:27:00].
    4.  Cover 2-4 stories per day/issue [00:27:20].
    5.  Memes can be sourced from Reddit, Twitter, or meme sites [00:27:36].
*   **Niche**: Recommend choosing a "prosumer" niche like business, tech, investing, or finance for better [[monetizing_newsletters | monetization opportunities]] [00:27:45].
*   **Speaker's Take**: The big idea here is creating more visual newsletters (using memes, infographics, GIFs) in spaces that are currently text-heavy, making content more engaging and less like "work to read" [00:28:17].

## 8. Industry-Specific AI Tips and Tactics
*   **Idea**: Model after "Write with AI" (a paid newsletter providing AI prompts and tips) and apply the concept to other categories, e.g., "AI for Marketers" or "AI for Lawyers" [00:29:14].
*   **Value Proposition**: People are willing to pay for content that provides cheat codes, saves time, or saves money with AI tools and tactics [00:29:46].
*   **[[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | Monetization Strategy]]**: Paid newsletter subscription [00:29:20]. "Write with AI" generates $200,000 ARR with a $200/year or $20/month subscription [00:29:28].
*   **Speaker's Question**: The success of "Write with AI" is linked to its founders' large social media audiences [00:29:58]. The question is whether such a paid newsletter can succeed without an existing large social audience, relying solely on paid acquisition (e.g., Facebook ads at $20/paid subscriber) [00:30:13].

## 9. Lessons from Leaders or Inspirational Figures
*   **Idea**: Feature highlights and lessons learned from inspirational leaders [00:31:01].
*   **Growth Potential**: This type of content translates well to social media (especially X), making it a good way to grow a broad audience quickly [00:31:21]. Podcasts like "How I Built This" or "Business Breakdowns" can provide content ideas [00:31:32].
*   **Content Structure**: Keep the newsletter short (2-5 minutes max) [00:31:50]. For an investor niche profiling Warren Buffett, sections could include: Best interview, best quote, best book, best piece of advice [00:31:55]. Predictable formats with short, actionable content are preferred [00:32:07].
*   **[[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | Monetization Challenge]]**: This newsletter is trickier to monetize due to its broad nature and lack of a clear niche [00:31:11].
*   **Speaker's Take**: If focusing on inspirational leaders, target those who attract a "prosumer" audience [00:34:16]. For an investing niche like Warren Buffett, potential monetization ideas include:
    *   Raising a hedge fund [00:33:19].
    *   Starting a consulting agency based on a leader's principles [00:33:37].
    *   Selling courses [00:33:44].
    *   Developing a stock trading app focused on value investing [00:33:54].
    *   Creating an AI agent that optimizes portfolios like the profiled leader [00:34:02].

## 10. Local Newsletters
*   **Idea**: Create digestible, positive, and community-oriented local newsletters, filling a gap left by traditional media [00:34:34]. Avoid crime-heavy news [00:34:52].
*   **Examples**: "Things to Do This Weekend" (sent Thursday mornings) highlighting local events, live music, food, and fun [00:34:58]. Pro tip: Find locally sourced events not typically found on Eventbrite (e.g., chalkboards at cafes) [00:35:08].
*   **[[building_an_audience_for_newsletters | Subscriber Acquisition]]**:
    *   **Facebook Ads**: Acquire subscribers for less than 50 cents (e.g., "Five Restaurants to Try This Weekend in Miami" linking to a landing page) [00:35:24].
*   **[[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | Monetization Strategies]]**:
    *   **Local Sponsorships**: Target high Lifetime Value (LTV) businesses like lawyers, Realtors, and wealth managers [00:35:59].
*   **Success Stories**: Local newsletters can grow to six-figure businesses in one city and scale to seven figures by expanding to multiple cities [00:36:03]. Examples include "Naptown Scoop" (Annapolis, MD) doing $400k/year [00:36:14], "6AM City" growing to $8 million in revenue with 1.4 million subscribers [00:36:27], and "The Charlotte Agenda" acquired by Axios for $5 million [00:36:33].
*   **Key Insight**: Keep content positive, community-oriented, and curated [00:36:48]. In an AI-flooded content landscape, curation and a human touch can help differentiate [00:36:53].

## General Principles for Newsletter Businesses

*   **Data Enrichment**: Always aim to collect more than just an email address. Asking for job title, industry, company, and skills helps understand your audience for better [[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | monetization]] and targeting [00:04:33].
*   **Audience Building**: Focus on [[building_an_audience_for_newsletters | building an audience]] on one core social media platform (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, X) alongside paid ads to eventually reduce reliance on paid acquisition [00:16:28].
*   **Monetization Diversification**: While ads and events are common starting points, consider building and selling software to your audience, especially with the advent of AI coding platforms [00:23:35].
*   **Small Audience, Big Revenue**: You don't need hundreds of thousands of subscribers to be profitable. Audiences of 5,000-10,000 subscribers can generate significant revenue (e.g., $190,000/year for the real estate newsletter) [00:20:14].

These ideas provide a foundation for starting a substantial business that can evolve into an agency, software company, or marketplace, consistently generating subscribers and revenue each month [00:37:11]. In 2025, newsletter businesses are more relevant than ever [00:38:14].

Boltnew is a new AI tool that some users are claiming is replacing [[introduction_to_boltnew_and_its_benefits_over_cursor_ai | Cursor AI]] because it's easier to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Non-technical individuals can reportedly use Boltnew to [[building_prototypes_with_boltnew_for_nontechnical_users | create a prototype]] in 20 minutes or less, even more easily than Cursor AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It is viewed as a culmination of various AI tools, all placed into one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

While early and with some bugs, Boltnew shows significant potential for both developers and non-developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Why Explore AI Tools Like Boltnew?

For anyone looking to build their ideas, exploring tools like Boltnew is highly encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Although no AI tool is currently perfect, they are rapidly improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. By continually testing, iterating, playing, breaking, and learning with these tools, users build a foundational knowledge. This groundwork ensures that when the tools become highly effective, users are not starting from scratch but are ready to build and ship quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Key Features and Workflow for Beginners

### Rapid Prototyping
[[building_prototypes_with_boltnew_for_nontechnical_users | Boltnew]] allows users to generate a simple landing page or a text-to-image AI application with a prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Unlike some other tools, Boltnew builds out entire projects, including layouts and landing pages, and importantly, installs necessary external packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This means a working prototype can be achieved very quickly, potentially in less than 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

### Handling Bugs and Errors
Boltnew, being a new tool, can experience issues and be slower due to being online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. A key tip for beginners is to copy any error messages that appear and paste them directly into the prompt, asking Boltnew to fix the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This workflow, though sometimes buggy, has shown to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Users should also be patient as the tool may take time to process requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

> "If you have grit and you just keep on pressing, giving it the air, telling it to fix it, I mean we did this in what maybe less than 20 minutes. Crazy right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>

### Deployment
Boltnew offers one-click deployment through a partnership with Netlify, a reliable deployment platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. While the deployment process can sometimes be finicky with external packages, Boltnew aims to handle the end-to-end process, which is a significant advantage for non-technical users compared to tools that require manual deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.

## [[comparing_boltnew_with_other_ai_development_tools_like_cursor_and_v0 | Comparing Boltnew with Other AI Development Tools]]

For non-technical individuals, especially founders or business people looking to start a [[startup_ideas_using_ai_technology | startup]] or build a simple proof-of-concept (POC), Boltnew and Replit are strong contenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. These tools excel at instant prototyping and providing a visual representation of how things would work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

In contrast, tools like Cursor allow more direct programming and coding, which might appeal to those who want to understand the "nitty-gritty" of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Cursor provides the feeling of having a "junior engineer" assist with coding, where the user is still largely in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. Boltnew and Replit, however, tend to "take the wheel" more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

For non-technical users, dealing with minor bugs in an AI tool like Boltnew is often preferable to navigating the complexities of manual deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

## General Advice for Aspiring Builders and Entrepreneurs

*   **Keep Playing**: Continuously [[getting_started_with_ai_platforms_like_lindy | play with AI tools]] and stay updated on new releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Exploring new tools helps develop a workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   **Commit to Learning**: The future involves committing to learning how to build, how to market, and how to optimize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>.
*   **Beyond Building**: Knowing how to build a product doesn't automatically mean knowing how to build a *successful* product that retains users, drives engagement, and generates word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. Success requires speaking to customers, understanding their pain points, and continually optimizing the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.
*   **Marketing is Key**: For developers who can build great products but lack marketing knowledge, it's crucial to understand that even the best products won't be successful without promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. Developers should consider putting out content, building a community, and committing to the marketing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

By combining the ability to rapidly prototype with AI tools and a commitment to understanding user needs and marketing, individuals can effectively [[building_a_business_with_ai_tools | build a business with AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

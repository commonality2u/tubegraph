Validating an idea is a crucial first step when considering [[how_to_start_an_online_directory | starting an online directory]]. It ensures that there is an actual audience and demand for the directory before significant time and resources are invested in [[building_a_profitable_online_directory | building]] it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. John Rush highlights that people are making significant monthly incomes (5K, 10K, 15K, 20K) with online directories, considering it one of the lowest-risk ways to start a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Why Validate Directory Ideas Now?

The current era is seen as a "Golden Era of directories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. As internet content proliferates, the quality of information becomes paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Directories address this by offering curation, which users increasingly desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. People trust well-curated directories that feature high-quality content, reviews, and ratings, and are managed by individuals knowledgeable in their niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This trend suggests users are outsourcing decision-making from broad search engines like Google to specialized, trusted directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## The Best Way to Find and Validate Ideas

The most effective method for [[finding_and_validating_niche_ideas_for_directories | finding and validating directory ideas]] is to start with keyword research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This process determines if people are actively searching for certain keywords and phrases related to your idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Using Google Keyword Planner

Google provides a tool called Keyword Planner, primarily used for planning ads, but it's also excellent for assessing search traffic for keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. John Rush spends hours daily using this tool to test various ideas and gauge traffic potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  **Entering a broad keyword**: For instance, "business ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
2.  **Analyzing search volume**: Observe the monthly search volume. A high volume (e.g., 1 million searches per month for "business ideas") indicates significant interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
3.  **Checking competition**: The competition metric (often related to ad competition) can give an indication of how saturated the keyword is, though it's specifically for ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Domain Name Selection

Once a keyword is identified, the next step is to find a domain name that matches the keyword as closely as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Google's algorithm now prioritizes the *meaning* of keywords over exact word matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This means variations with similar meanings (e.g., "tiny," "micro," "mini" for "small") can still rank well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

An example of success with an exact match domain was "nextjsstarters.com," which gained significant traffic quickly due to its direct keyword match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. John advises being creative to find available domains that are inexpensive, typically under $9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Building the Directory for Validation

After validating an idea and securing a domain, the focus shifts to building the directory in the most efficient way to continue the validation process.

### Prioritizing No-Code Tools

Building with no-code tools like Unicorn Platform is highly recommended, even for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. No-code solutions offer:
*   **Faster launch**: Templates enable rapid deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Marketing flexibility**: Modern CMS and web builders include built-in features for marketing pages, A/B tests, blogs, and programmatic SEO, which are difficult and time-consuming to implement manually in code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Ease of content management**: Non-technical team members can easily manage and publish content, unlike coded sites that require developer intervention for every change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Minimal Viable Directory

For the initial launch, keep the directory extremely simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The only essential elements are a simple page with a name and the directory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Advanced features like ratings or user reviews should be added later, as they would be empty initially anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### Leveraging AI for Content Generation

AI tools can significantly speed up the initial content creation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. AI can generate:
*   Directory structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>
*   Menu items and text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>
*   Featured ideas sections, which help with [[seo_optimization_for_directory_websites | SEO]] by providing more text and potential target pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>
*   FAQ sections: Each FAQ title can be a potential Google search query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. By researching "how do I..." suggestions on Google, common questions can be identified and answered in the FAQ, capturing additional traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. For example, "how to start a business as a teenager" is a valuable, less obvious keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

Initially, John recommends creating "fake items" or short AI-generated content for these potential keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. The goal is to do "as little as possible to validate all the assumptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. If a keyword shows traffic in Google Search Console, then invest human time to create a full, high-quality page for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Rapid Iteration and Multiple Bets

The entire initial build and basic setup should take no more than one evening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Speed is critical because there's a high chance any single idea might fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

It is recommended to bet on five, six, or even ten directory ideas simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. This approach removes the disappointment of a single idea failing and accelerates the validation process, especially since [[seo_optimization_for_directory_websites | SEO]] takes time to yield results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

After building and initial promotion, stop working on the directory for about 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. After this period, check the traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. If there's no traffic, it's very difficult to fix the fundamental issues (e.g., wrong domain name, misjudged keyword difficulty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.

The advice is to "never fall in love with the idea for a directory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>. Instead, focus on the directories that perform best in the initial 30-day period and then invest more time into those <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. This strategy optimizes effort and increases the chances of success for [[building_a_profitable_online_directory | profitable online directories]].

AI-powered applications are demonstrating substantial financial success, with some individual apps and development studios generating hundreds of thousands of dollars in monthly revenue. This emerging trend highlights a shift in how entrepreneurs are leveraging existing AI technologies for rapid monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Case Study: The Riz App (Plug AI)

A prominent example of this trend is a specific [[ai_dating_coach_apps_and_their_impact | AI dating coach]] app, initially identified as "Riz" but later clarified to be "Plug AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
*   **Revenue and Downloads:** This app reportedly generates $190,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> and sees 333,000 downloads monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Origin:** The founder, a 23-year-old, conceived the idea from a Tinder subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Functionality:** It operates as a "ChatGPT wrapper," specifically focused on companionship and dating. Users can upload screenshots of text messages and receive AI-generated pickup lines or responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. The term "Riz" is a colloquialism used by younger generations for "rizz" or "charisma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Developer's Portfolio and Strategy
The founder's development studio, "AI RZ," has launched three apps in total, collectively generating approximately $500,000 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Plug AI:** The dating assistant described above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Astra:** An app providing life advice, covering topics like personal growth, compatibility, and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Pallet:** An app that uses [[using_ai_in_mobile_apps | AI]] to determine a user's color season from a selfie and generates personalized style and makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

This strategy involves providing "coaching" in various specific verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The key is leveraging existing technology (like ChatGPT) rather than building complex proprietary systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Success hinges on strong branding, simple positioning, and effective referral flows within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Sustainability and Risks of AI App Businesses

While such rapid success attracts skepticism, particularly regarding the longevity of "flash in the pan" businesses or their reliance on third-party APIs like OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>, there are arguments for their value:
*   **Financial Stability:** Even if short-lived, these ventures can generate significant profit (e.g., an estimated 65% margin after Apple's 30% cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>), potentially allowing founders to achieve financial independence or "first nut" capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.
*   **Transferable Skills:** The experience gained in running these businesses, from marketing to operations, provides valuable, transferable skills for future ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
*   **Diversification:** The founder's approach of having multiple apps in different niches mitigates the risk associated with any single app or market fluctuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

## Anti-Trends and Future Opportunities

The success of these [[ai_app_startups_and_ideas | AI app startups]] also highlights opportunities in "anti-trends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. While AI-driven solutions are booming, there is also an anticipated demand for human-centric alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
*   **Human-Powered Services:** For instance, a human-led dating coach service could offer a premium, more personalized alternative to an [[ai_dating_coach_apps_and_their_impact | AI dating coach]] app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Less Competition:** Anti-trend businesses often face less competition compared to saturated AI markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   **Non-Obvious Use Cases:** For those looking to enter the [[AI app startups and ideas | AI app startup]] space, focusing on "non-obvious use cases" beyond common applications like dating or therapy can yield more unique opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal for many is not necessarily to "change the world" initially, but to "change your world" by achieving financial stability, which then provides the capital and freedom to pursue broader impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

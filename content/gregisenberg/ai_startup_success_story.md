From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Zach Yagari, a 17-year-old entrepreneur, built an [[ai_powered_startup_ideas | AI startup]] called Cal AI, which generates over $1 million per month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Cal AI is an AI calorie tracking app that diagnoses food from a picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Key Principles from Cal AI's Success

Zach Yagari shares insights from his experience and provides a playbook for building and marketing [[ai_startup_ideas_and_frameworks | AI startup ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Designing Simple and Digestible Apps

Zach's approach to app design focuses on simplicity and clarity, drawing inspiration from existing "primitives" or building blocks in successful apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

*   **User Experience (UX) First**: Zach designs the UX himself, often making rough sketches before hiring a talented designer to refine them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Core Features**: Identify the main features and build the app around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Inspiration from Primitives**: Look at similar successful apps (e.g., PhotoMath for scanning screens, Riz GPT for feature display) to understand existing UI/UX patterns rather than reinventing the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This concept of "primitives" refers to the fundamental building blocks an app should possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Avoid Loading Screens**: Instead of making users wait on an analyzing screen, take them back to the home screen with a loading indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Gamification for Digestibility**: Presenting information in a simple, numerical format (e.g., 0-5 danger level) makes it more digestible and engaging for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **User Investment**: Incorporate a history or log feature to create user investment, making them more likely to stick with the app if competitors emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This history can also be useful for sharing with professionals, like doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

> [!TIP] **Branding for Virality**
> Place the app's name prominently on key screens, especially those that generate a "wow factor" and are likely to be shown in marketing materials (e.g., scanning screen, results screen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. This helps viewers understand the app's value quickly during short influencer videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.

### Effective AI Prompting

A crucial aspect of an [[ai_powered_startup_ideas | AI app's]] success is the underlying prompting strategy.

*   **Role Assignment**: When using AI APIs, assign a specific role (e.g., "You are a doctor") to guide the AI's response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Bypassing Disclaimers**: Creative prompting, like framing the request as part of a "movie script," can help bypass AI's inherent disclaimers and get more direct responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.
*   **Function Calls**: Utilize function calls in API interactions to ensure the AI's response is structured and directly assigned to specific variables, allowing for precise data extraction (e.g., only the diagnosis in a quote) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.
*   **Accuracy is Paramount**: For applications like medical diagnoses, ensuring the AI's accuracy is critical. Generic prompts often lead to inaccurate or misleading results, which can be detrimental (e.g., miscalculating calories in a food tracking app) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

### Go-to-Market Strategy: Influencer Marketing

Zach emphasizes influencer marketing as a primary lever for driving app downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

*   **Audience Analysis**: It's crucial to look at the *audience* of an influencer, not just their niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. This can be done by reading their comments to understand who is engaging with their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   **Targeting**: For a medical AI app like Dr. AI, target audiences might include concerned parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.
*   **Storytelling Angle**: Influencers should create realistic scenarios that play on user emotions (e.g., a parent worried about their child's bump on the skin) to showcase the app's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.
*   **Pricing for Influencers**:
    *   Understand RPM (Revenue Per Thousand Views) and CPM (Cost Per Thousand Views) to ensure profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.
    *   Influencers are typically paid upfront, not on a per-view basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.
    *   Predict likely views to set a profitable CPM (e.g., paying under $5,000 for 1 million views at a $5 RPM would be profitable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

### Pricing Strategy for Apps

*   **Weekly Pricing Model**: For apps that users might need intermittently rather than daily, a weekly pricing model can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. This capitalizes on "repeat users" who subscribe when needed, unsubscribe, and then resubscribe later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.
*   **No Free Trial**: For certain utility apps, not offering a free trial can lead to more immediate revenue, as users are willing to pay for immediate relief or solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.
*   **A/B Testing**: Continuously A/B test different pricing structures (e.g., $4 vs. $7 weekly, various monthly/yearly options, with or without free trials) to find the highest proceeds per download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>. Zach typically explores weekly prices around $4-$7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.

> [!WARNING] **Ethical Considerations for AI Apps**
> Always include clear disclaimers, especially for apps dealing with sensitive information like health diagnoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. Accuracy is paramount; avoid basic "GPT wrappers" that provide inaccurate information, which can harm users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

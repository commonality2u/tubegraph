Many people seeking wealth overlook "boring" or "sweaty" businesses in favor of high-tech startups. However, numerous wealthy individuals have built their fortunes through traditional, often unglamorous, service-based ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. These businesses, while requiring hard work, can offer higher odds of success and substantial financial returns compared to more competitive tech sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Boring Businesses

"Boring" businesses are typically characterized by:
*   **Essential services** that people always need, regardless of economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Lower competition**, often against established, less technologically advanced players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **Tangible work** involving physical labor, manual tasks, or hands-on management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping potential**, meaning they can often be started with minimal capital and no external funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Profitability from day one** is often achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

The goal is to choose a "game" with higher odds of winning, even if the individual wins are smaller than a high-risk, high-reward tech venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

## Examples of Successful Boring Businesses

Many individuals have achieved significant wealth through these types of ventures:

*   **Underground Utilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   **Surveying Companies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   **HVAC Businesses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   **Real Estate Developers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

### Detailed Case Studies

#### Student Pickup and Delivery Storage
Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," built and sold Storage Squad, a business that stored students' belongings over the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Model:** Pickup and delivery storage for university students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Revenue:** Peaked at approximately $2.2 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Profit:** Earned $400k-$500k per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Marketing:** Primarily used sidewalk chalk ads at universities, reaching customers where they lived and attended class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Paid ads were only introduced after exceeding $2 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping:** Started with a $1,500 cargo van and a $2,200 box truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Exit:** Sold in 2020 for $1.75 million with no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The idea originated from a Craigslist ad where a student wanted storage instead of leasing an apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

#### Self-Storage Facilities
Leveraging profits from Storage Squad, Nick Huber and his partner invested in self-storage facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **First Acquisition:** Bought a 40,000 sq ft facility with 180+ units in Erie, PA, for $625k at a public auction in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It was neglected, making only $4,000/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Second Acquisition:** Purchased a self-storage facility in North Georgia for $1.5 million. It was generating $15,600-$16,000/month and now earns $40,000/month, valued at $4.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. No complex strategies or fundraising were involved; simple improvements led to significant value appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Other High-Potential "Sweaty Startups"

*   **Lawn Care:** Nick Huber's brother runs a lawn care company, earning over $100,000 annually by using bandit signs for marketing for a few months a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Mobile Detailing:** A one-year college graduate earns $120,000 annually with a mobile detailing business, making $10,000 profit on $17,000 revenue in a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **High-End Airport Transportation:** A driver in Atlanta with three additional drivers provides high-end transportation to the airport, doing "really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Firewood Delivery with Custom Racks:** Building on-site firewood racks for $100 in materials allows for charging $800-$1,000 per delivery. Two deliveries a day could yield $1,000 profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This could also be a subscription service with recurring revenue and an entry point to other services like lawn care, snow clearing, or tree work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **In-Bar TV Advertising Network:** A local entrepreneur in North Georgia charges businesses $10/month to display their ads on rotating TVs in 70 bars and restaurants, netting $20,000/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This model fosters loyalty among local business owners, driving traffic to the bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Putting Green Installation:** A higher-skilled business, but custom turf installations can yield $30,000 to $200,000 per project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Tree Removal:** Despite high risk and equipment costs, two workers can earn over $3,000 for four hours of work, demonstrating high hourly earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Christmas Light Installation:** Homeowners pay $3,500-$4,000 to have Christmas lights installed for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Deck Building** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>
*   **Power Washing:** A low-skill, low-capital entry point for cleaning concrete, furniture, or decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>.
*   **Concrete Work** (driveways, patios) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>
*   **Bounce House Rentals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>

### Proposed Future Ventures

*   **Nanny Recruiting Company:** A service to help parents find nannies by posting jobs, screening calls, conducting background checks, and setting up interviews. Could charge $3,000-$5,000 per placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Night Nurses .com (Hybrid Sweaty/Digital Business):** Building a directory or recruiting service for night nurses.
    *   **Market:** High-value customers (new parents) at the beginning of their journey, opening doors for cross-selling other baby/home outfitting services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
    *   **Domain:** The domain "nightnurses.com" is available for $13,000, or can be leased-to-own for $1,100/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. This is seen as valuable digital real estate, similar to physical property investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** Start as a direct recruiting service (a "sweaty" digital business) charging a one-time fee of $1,000 to find, vet, and set up interviews for night nurses. This would be profitable from the start and could generate $20,000/month by placing 20 nurses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. Over time, it could integrate AI for directory building, blogs for organic traffic, and become a fintech company handling payroll for nurses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

## Advantages of Boring Businesses Over AI Startups

While the current era sees a "renaissance" of AI startups, the hosts argue that focusing on "boring" businesses offers distinct advantages:
*   **Lower failure rate:** A high percentage of AI startups (estimated 93-99%) will not reach profitability, leading to significant losses for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.
*   **Less intense competition:** Instead of competing with "brilliant" computer science graduates backed by millions in venture capital, one competes with existing local businesses that may be less technologically savvy or customer-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
*   **AI as a tool, not the business:** AI is more likely to become a tool that makes existing [[business_in_a_box_concepts | business in a box concepts]] more profitable and less labor-intensive, rather than solely creating standalone AI companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. This aligns with [[scaling_businesses_with_nichefocused_funnels | scaling businesses with nichefocused funnels]] and [[innovative_business_ideas_and_models | innovative business ideas and models]] that are not necessarily high-tech.
*   **Foundation for future tech:** A successful "sweaty" business can serve as a strong foundation upon which to build a tech component later, like the Night Nurses .com example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

## The Importance of Domain Names

A good domain name is considered crucial "digital real estate" for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   **Investment:** Spending thousands on a prime `.com` domain is seen as a worthwhile investment, comparable to investing in physical property or renovating a building's facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Value:** A strong `.com` domain can lead to increased leads, organic traffic, and long-term brand recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. It's argued that large language models (LLMs) may prioritize `.com` domains in search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   **Example:** Nick Huber spent $450,000 on "somewhere.com" for his recruiting business, seeing more than that value returned within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Poor Domain Impact:** A difficult-to-spell or remember domain can force a business to spend heavily on paid advertising to rank in search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. This concept relates to [[building_competitive_ai_businesses | building competitive AI businesses]] and [[identifying_trending_and_growing_subreddits_for_business_opportunities | identifying trending and growing subreddits for business opportunities]] as a strong domain enhances online presence regardless of the business type.

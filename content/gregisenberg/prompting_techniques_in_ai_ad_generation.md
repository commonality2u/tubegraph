[[using_ai_for_ad_creation | Creating ads with AI]] can significantly increase return on ad spend (ROAS) and profitability for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Mastering [[prompting_techniques_for_effective_use_of_ai_models | how to prompt models like ChatGPT 4o]] is crucial for generating winning ads, memes, and visual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Core Prompting Principles with ChatGPT 4o
Unlike image models such as Midjourney or Ideogram, ChatGPT 4o is a multimodal language model where "prompting is way less important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Users can be "pretty straightforward" with prompts, as it has a strong understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

The most important elements for creating effective ads are the **inspiration images** and **product images** provided to the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Leveraging Reference and Product Imagery
A general piece of advice for generating ads is to provide an inspiration ad that you want to adjust, along with your own custom product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### When to Use Reference Images
*   **For lesser-known or new products:** If your product is relatively new, small, or lacks significant online presence (e.g., millions of dollars in ad spend monthly), always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **For well-known brands:** Models like ChatGPT 4o have a strong understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge Wallets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For these, a reference image may not be necessary, as the AI "knows it really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Examples of Reference Image Use:

*   **Jones Road Beauty Ad:** A basic prompt like "add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" combined with an inspiration ad and a product image yields good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The AI understands the intentions well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **AG1 Ad Recreation:** To recreate an ad for a different product, precise instructions like "recreate this ad for ag1 adjust the background to better fit athletic green style change the price... generate the image" can produce a runnable ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This method is common practice in the industry, where companies find inspiration ads or use templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Ridge Wallet Seasonal Change:** An existing ad (e.g., a Black Friday ad) can be transformed by simply providing a new product image and a prompt like "swap it out and change it to a Christmas style ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

## Utilizing Specific Keywords and Styles
*   **Photo Realism:** Use keywords such as "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to ensure the AI generates images that do not appear cartoonish or have odd colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Font and Style Adjustments:** For well-known fonts, the AI has a decent understanding, allowing users to specify font types (e.g., "font type exo2 bold italic") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Similar adjustments can be made for color styles and aspect ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Detailed Descriptions:** A detailed prose description of the desired image can be very effective, especially when no reference image is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. For example, describing a "female runner captured in mid-stride running laterally in the foreground wearing her performance gear" with the "Egyptian desert with the pyramids" behind her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Refining Your Prompts and Workflow
*   **Clarity and Directness:** When struggling with initial prompts, it's important to be "very clear, very direct in what you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Starting New Chats for Adjustments:** If an initial prompt doesn't yield the desired result, it's generally better to "start a new chat" and make adjustments to the prompt in that new chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to "worse and worse" results because the AI uses the generated image (with its flaws) as a reference for the next one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Preventing Text Generation:** To ensure the AI generates an image instead of text representing an ad, explicitly state "generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Specifying Output:** While ChatGPT 4o currently generates one image at a time, other tools like Sora allow generating multiple versions (e.g., up to four) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. The ability to control the number of outputs is expected to become available in ChatGPT in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratios:** ChatGPT 4o defaults to a 9x16 aspect ratio, but users can specify others like 1x1 or 9x16 in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

## Practical Application: Generating an Ad for LCA
When generating an ad for a lesser-known company like LCA (Late Checkout Agency), a "higher risk ad" scenario, the process involves:
1.  **Providing Context:** Describe the company's nature (e.g., "SWAT team design agency," "only for the most interesting brands," "helping them with AI building AI first products") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
2.  **Using Screenshots as Inspiration:** Upload screenshots from the company's website (e.g., logo, typography, client brands) as inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
3.  **Incorporating a Style Reference:** Use a vintage Rolex ad as inspiration to "capture the luxury vibe of the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
4.  **Initial Vague Prompting:** Start with a relatively vague prompt relying on the AI's creativity, like "generate a digital ad for LCA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
5.  **Refining with New Chat:** If the initial result (e.g., a man wearing a Rolex instead of showing client logos) is not perfect, start a new chat, provide the AI-generated image, and refine the prompt (e.g., "rather than generating a watch, show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. This [[sequential_prompting_for_ai_workflows | sequential prompting]] helps to guide the AI more precisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.

Using this method, an ad can be created that captures the desired aesthetic, even for a niche company, within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.

## Future Trends and Opportunities
The ability to generate varied ads at scale allows for extensive experimentation, which is key to finding ads that convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This means rapidly testing different demographics (e.g., "men female old young all different colors") to see "what converts for different audiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This capability enables [[targeting_specific_audiences_with_aigenerated_ads | highly personalized AI-generated ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

*   **Real-time Marketing:** Companies can leverage AI to create ads that capitalize on "short like new cycle moments" (e.g., responding to a controversial news story with a clever ad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. AI could potentially monitor news feeds (like Twitter) and mass-produce relevant ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **Video Content:** While directly generating pure video from these images isn't common yet, people are already animating AI-generated ads for display purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>. Tools like Runway and Sora can be explored for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.
*   **Creative Inspiration:** Platforms like Sora's explore page are valuable resources for understanding how the "best prompts work" and for ideation, as they often display the prompt used to create each image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This helps users find aesthetics not currently used in their market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Other tools like Creative OS, Forplay, and Icon.me provide ad inspiration and templating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

This era presents an "incredible time to create memes, ads, creative" content and stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

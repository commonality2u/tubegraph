Manis AI, while powerful in its capabilities, also presents several limitations and challenges during its operation. Users may encounter issues ranging from performance declines to operational errors, especially given its current beta status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

## General Performance Issues
While Manis AI is impressive, there are aspects that are "not impressed with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The tool is still in beta, and users should expect to encounter "a lot of errors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. Frequent errors have been observed, particularly as more users gain access to the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

## Contextual Limitations
A significant limitation of [[manis_ai_capabilities_and_limitations | Manis AI]] is its performance decline with "extremely long context" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. When a task becomes "very complex" or involves "a lot of information that it has to process," Manis AI can struggle, leading to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. This contextual limitation is considered a major issue that the Manis AI team needs to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>.

## Operational Hiccups
*   **Captchas:** Manis AI has been observed to "get stuck on like captchas," requiring human intervention to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Missing Information:** At times, Manis AI may miss crucial information during a task, necessitating additional user input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Getting Stuck:** The system can get stuck during processes, such as collecting data from websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   **Critical Issues & Resets:** Users may encounter "critical issue[s]" that prompt them to reset Manis's computer or start a new session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:31:05]</a>. While it attempts to remember where it left off, a reset doesn't guarantee a fix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:23]</a>.

## Deployment Challenges
Manis AI has faced difficulties with its "deployment process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:05]</a>. It may run into "terminal error[s]" when trying to package files, such as zipping up code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:36:01]</a>. The tool prefers local execution rather than deploying to a public network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:16]</a>. This suggests that the deployment aspect of Manis AI is "not an easy one that they have solved yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:48:01]</a>.

## Usage Limits
As Manis AI is in a beta stage, it currently has a "maximum daily usage limit," which is believed to be around 10 requests or sessions per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:55]</a>. While a workaround might exist by starting a new session after hitting the limit, this is not an ideal user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:51]</a>.

## Security Concerns
Given that Manis AI is a Chinese company, there are valid [[security_concerns_with_using_chinese_ai_tools | security concerns]] regarding data privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:21]</a>. Chinese companies are obligated to provide government access to data, which makes some users reluctant to share sensitive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:46]</a>. Users are advised to be "very careful and mindful of what type of data that you give to and give access to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:27]</a>. It is recommended to avoid providing personal information and to use simple prompts to understand the tool's functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:06]</a>. Additionally, if running code locally, it is advisable to "scan through the code just in case" and run it in a virtual sandbox rather than directly on a local machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:52]</a>.

## Scalability Challenges
A notable challenge for Manis AI is "scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:45]</a>. The platform is currently invitation-only with limited access codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:50:03]</a>. The increase in users has led to the web being "hammered," resulting in more frequent errors compared to when fewer people had access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:51:01]</a>. This [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_ai_integration | scalability issue]] will need to be addressed before a full public launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:15]</a>.

Despite these [[manis_ai_capabilities_and_limitations | limitations]], Manis AI's ability to act as a multi-agent system that plans, designs, executes, and analyzes results, along with its capability for deep research and browser control, makes it a significant development in agentic AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:36]</a>. However, it is not yet perfect and requires further development, particularly in handling complex tasks and improving its deployment and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:44]</a>.

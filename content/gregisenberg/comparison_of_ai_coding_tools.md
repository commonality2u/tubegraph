## AI Agents
The role of AI agents in these platforms relates to the user's clarity on their desired product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

*   **Tools with Agents**: Cursor and Windsurf (with Cascade) have agent features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Replit also features "Replit Agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   **Utility**: Agents are most useful when a user doesn't know exactly what they want (e.g., "create a to-do list app") and needs the AI to generate a more complete output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
*   **Comparison**: Tools without agents, like Tempo, might generate a layout and then ask for next steps, requiring more user input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   **Underlying Models**: All these tools generally use the same underlying AI models (e.g., Claude, DeepSeek), so the core AI capability is similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. The difference lies in how much control and specific information the user wants to provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Recommendations and Conclusion
To find the best tool, it is highly recommended to use the free tier of every tool and build a simple application, such as a to-do list app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. This hands-on experience helps evaluate personal preferences regarding control and AI assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

*   **Non-technical / Idea Guy**: Lovable, Bolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Technical / Likes to Code**: Windsurf, Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Technical / Doesn't want to Code but wants Control**: Replit, Tempo, Bolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Non-technical / Product-minded / Wants Control (e.g., uses Figma, likes design components)**: Tempo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

Ultimately, any tool can be used regardless of technical level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. However, aligning with tools that target your user profile often makes the experience smoother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. While none of these tools are perfect or can build full-grade production applications at this moment, they are close (70-80% there) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. Continuing to learn and build with these tools is crucial as they receive funding and develop, ensuring users are ready when they reach full production capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

[[using_ai_for_ad_creation | Using AI for ad creation]], specifically in the realm of User-Generated Content (UGC) ads, presents a significant opportunity in digital advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This approach leverages artificial intelligence to create ad content that traditionally would involve real people, offering massive cost savings and scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## The Opportunity

The search volume for "UGC ads" is experiencing exponential growth, indicating a high demand for this type of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. While UGC content has traditionally been used for ads, the emerging opportunity lies in utilizing AI avatars and AI-written scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. These AI-generated creations can serve as both advertisements and organic social media content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. The current quality of AI tools is sufficient to produce valuable content that gains views and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

### Why it's Working
AI UGC ads are effective because they often follow a problem-solution storytelling style, positioning the product as the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This format, resembling a "news-style TikTok," allows an AI talking head avatar to discuss information displayed in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. The perceived organic and personal nature of these ads makes them highly effective, much like someone sharing a personal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

## Creation Process

The process for creating AI UGC ads can be broken down into several steps:
1.  **Initial Scripting:** A human writes the initial script, focusing on a problem-solution narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. For example, a script might describe a friend's success with an email newsletter using an AI tool like Swell AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
2.  **AI Script Generation:** Use [[prompting_techniques_in_ai_ad_generation | ChatGPT]] to generate multiple variations (e.g., 10) of the initial script in the first person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
3.  **AI Avatar Generation:** Take these varied scripts and input them into AI avatar generation tools like HeyGen or Argil AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
4.  **Video Production:** These AI-generated videos can then be handed off to a video editor or created directly within the script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. The company only needs to provide background images and photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

### Cost and Time Savings
What previously took days and hundreds of dollars per ad (e.g., $500 for a 30-second clip on Billow) can now be done in minutes with AI avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Creating 10 ad variations might save up to $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This capability significantly reduces the logistical hurdles and time involved in traditional UGC creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Business Models and Scaling

### Agency Model
An agency can specialize in creating these [[aigenerated_commercial_production | AI-generated commercial production]] for other companies, offering unlimited content variations for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This allows businesses to continually test ad variations and formats without significant overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

### Product Model
Another option is to build a product around this capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. The key is to find existing frameworks that are working (e.g., storytelling arcs or meme templates) and populate them with new content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

### A/Z Testing and Ad Optimization
The ability to quickly generate hundreds or thousands of ad variations (A/Z testing) is a game-changer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. By running numerous permutations simultaneously, advertisers can rapidly identify winning ads that perform significantly better than average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. This optimization can reduce cost per click (CPC) dramatically (e.g., from $1 to $0.10), effectively multiplying an ad budget's impact by ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

Facebook and other platforms are intelligent enough to automatically identify which ads will yield the best conversions once enough variations are run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. This allows ad specialists to focus on creating as many diverse ad creatives as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. This new paradigm of ad creation at scale was previously impossible due to prohibitive costs and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.

### Organic Social Distribution
Beyond paid ads, this content can also generate organic views on social platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. By posting these videos across multiple social accounts (e.g., using burner phones for different profiles), they can become viral "for you page" content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

## The Arbitrage Opportunity

There is a massive, but fleeting, arbitrage opportunity for companies and solopreneurs to build businesses on the back of this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. The cost of creation is incredibly low (e.g., $150 for subscriptions to HeyGen, ChatGPT, and Descript) compared to the traditional hundreds of thousands of dollars for a thousand ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. This allows for optimization at a volume and scale previously unimaginable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

This [[future_of_digital_advertising_using_ai_technology | future of digital advertising using AI technology]] is already being leveraged by younger, "degenerate" entrepreneurs working from dorm rooms or basements, often outperforming traditional "old heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>. The ability to create thousands of ad variations provides a significant competitive advantage; for example, in the 2016 US election, Donald Trump reportedly won by creating more ad variations than Hillary Clinton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>. In a competitive market, having more "bats" (ad variations) guarantees a higher chance of winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>.

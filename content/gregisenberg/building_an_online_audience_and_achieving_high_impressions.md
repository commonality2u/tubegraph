This article outlines a blueprint for achieving a $10 million liquid net worth, focusing on building an online audience and generating high impressions. While making significant money online is challenging, this plan highlights the areas with the most opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The approach has been observed to work effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Step 1: Pick Your Niche

Selecting the right niche is one of the most crucial steps in this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It's recommended to pick a specific, "niche" area, such as "AI for solopreneurs," rather than general "business tips" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Tools for Niche Research
Several tools can help identify and validate niches:

*   **Reddit:** Platforms like Reddit provide insights into ideas and pain points. You can use tools built on Reddit, like Gummy Search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, or directly explore subreddits. Looking at top posts for a given month can reveal what people are discussing and help you identify specific opportunities within a broader topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. For example, within the FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) community, you might find sub-niches like "FIRE movement and health insurance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Google Trends:** This is a powerful, yet underutilized, tool for understanding what's trending. For instance, you can track the "FIRE movement" to see its popularity over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   **Glimpse:** This tool supercharges Google Trends by providing additional search terms and related queries, helping you uncover deeper niche opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Step 2: Achieve 250,000 Impressions Per Month

The next step is to consistently generate 250,000 impressions per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. While one viral hit can contribute, consistency is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This is achievable within 90 days, even starting from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Strategies for High Impressions
*   **Post Daily & Engage:** Regular posting and active engagement are crucial for building an audience and getting noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Understand Your Niche:** Create content that resonates with your chosen niche and encourages sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Establish Presence:** Choose a name or handle that resonates, and craft a compelling bio and cover photo to communicate who you are and what you're doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. An example is Marty, who clearly articulates his goal ("bootstrapping a video platform for realtors profits to buy first house") and includes an aspirational cover photo of his dream home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Step 3: Convert Impressions to Leads

The aim is to convert 0.5% of your 250,000 monthly impressions into leads, which translates to approximately 1,250 organic leads per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Creating Irresistible Lead Magnets
Develop valuable content that people will be eager to access in exchange for their contact information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Calculators, ebooks, or videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Gamma.app (Gamma AI):** This tool helps create visually appealing presentations, documents, and websites without requiring coding knowledge, which can then be gated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. You can incorporate photos, videos, and charts, utilizing various templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
    *   **Framer.com:** Used for creating simple yet effective landing pages for lead magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness:** These lead magnets can significantly boost newsletter subscriptions, potentially adding 5,000 to 10,000 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## Step 4: Monetize Leads Immediately

A common mistake is not monetizing leads quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. You can earn an affiliate commission (e.g., $1 per lead) by recommending relevant products or services, such as a software company or other affiliates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. The value per lead can vary from $0.50 to $7 depending on the affiliate and customer value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

*   **SparkLoop:** This platform allows you to earn money by recommending other newsletters to your subscribers, typically ranging from $0.50 to $3 per recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Step 5: Reinvest Profits in Lead Buying

Once you're generating income from your organic leads (e.g., $1,250 from 1,250 leads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, reinvest that money to acquire more leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Leads can be purchased on platforms like Meta for $1-$3 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. For example, $1,250 could buy 625 additional leads at $2 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Step 6: Create a Lead Generation Machine

By combining organic leads (from platforms like Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn) with purchased leads, you create a robust lead generation machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

At this stage, you should have:
*   A niche validated by Google Trends or Reddit, with low competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   Content-market fit, meaning your content resonates with your audience and occasionally goes viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   Conversion of people into leads who will eventually buy your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   Income generated per lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## Step 7: Nurture Leads Extensively

With a growing number of leads (potentially 50,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, nurturing them is essential to prevent them from forgetting about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### Nurturing Strategies
*   **Weekly Newsletter:** Provide consistent value, keeping your audience engaged and informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Community Building:** Create a community (e.g., WhatsApp, School, Facebook group) and provide so much value that members feel obligated to support your paid offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Step 8: Ask the Community What to Build

Before developing a product, ask your nurtured community about their pain points and prioritize solutions that are relatively easy to build as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

## Step 9: Launch a $30/Month Offer

Introduce a paid offer (e.g., $30/month) that feels like a "no-brainer" to your audience, aiming for $300+ per customer annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Some individuals will purchase simply as a "tip" or "thank you" for the consistent free value you've provided over several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

## Step 10: Convert Leads to Customers

Convert 3% of your total leads (organic + paid) into new customers. If you have 1,875 total leads, this translates to 56 new customers per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This conversion becomes surprisingly easy when your offer is tailored to a specific niche that desires your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Step 11: Achieve Year One ARR

In the first year, with 56 new customers per month, you would have 672 customers annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. At $300 Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) per customer, this amounts to $201,600 ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. While this might seem small, remember that this is just the beginning of compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

## Step 12: Reinvest Profits in Lead Buying (Continued)

Resist the temptation to spend profits on luxury items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Instead, reinvest all profits back into lead acquisition to turn your funnel into a self-sustaining vending machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

## Step 13: Achieve Year Three ARR

By year three, with continued reinvestment and growth, you could reach 5,000 customers and $1.5 million in ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

## Step 14: Introduce Higher-Ticket Upsells

At this point, you can introduce premium upsells to your power users. For example:
*   20% of power users upgrade to $100/month.
*   5% upgrade to $500/month.

This could increase your ARR to $2.7 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

## Step 15: Five-Year Growth Plan

Assuming a conservative 50% annual growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, by year five, your business could reach $9.11 million in ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

## Step 16: Exit Strategy

At this point, you could exit the business for 3 to 5 times ARR, potentially yielding $27 million to $45 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. Alternatively, you could keep the business as a cash cow, similar to owning an apartment building without a large down payment or bank loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

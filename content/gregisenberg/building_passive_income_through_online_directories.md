From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Frey, an expert in [[how_to_start_an_online_directory | building online directories]], shares insights on creating platforms that generate substantial passive income. His methods focus on developing simple, high-traffic directories that can yield between $2,000 and $10,000 a month with minimal weekly maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This approach can be maintained with as little as 15 minutes of work per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Frey's Approach to Online Directories

Frey's first directory website, built in October 2022, is designed differently from typical directory sites that use modern maps and complex search functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. His preferred type of directory is evergreen and location-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This site has been [[monetizing_online_directories | monetized]] for 18 months straight, requires about 15 minutes of monthly maintenance, and generated approximately $2,300 in revenue last month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. While [[using_ai_and_seo_to_grow_online_directories | AI tools]] can be recommended for certain parts, they are not strictly necessary to get started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

The process involves:
*   Finding and validating a niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
*   Creating a basic directory optimized for [[seo_strategies_for_online_directories | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   Ensuring the chosen niche solves a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
*   Acquiring, cleaning, and enriching data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
*   Implementing the directory on a content management system (CMS) like WordPress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>

## Examples of Successful Online Directories

Frey showcases several "weird" or "boring" directory websites that achieve significant traffic and revenue, demonstrating the potential for [[building_wealth_through_boring_businesses | boring businesses]]:

### RoadsideAmerica.com
This directory lists quirky roadside attractions in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Despite an aesthetically unpleasing design, it attracts 85,000 monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Monetization:** Primarily through display ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Traffic Quality:** Approximately 96% Tier 1 traffic (US, Canada, Australia, UK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** Has remained resilient despite recent Google core updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Estimated Income:** Conservatively estimated at $5,000-$7,000 per month passively from display ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### AtlasObscura.com
This worldwide directory focuses on off-the-beaten-path attractions that locals might know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Traffic:** Attracts 7 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** Shows little to no effect from Google core updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Traffic Quality:** 90-91% Tier 1 traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Monetization:** Primarily through display ads (AdSense), and also sells a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Estimated Income:** Conservatively $30,000 per month from AdSense, potentially closer to $50,000-$60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### FindAGrave.com
A directory for locating burial sites, including those of historical figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Traffic:** Receives 1.4 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** Also resilient to Google updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Traffic Quality:** 92% Tier 1 traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Monetization:** Main form of [[monetization_strategies_for_directory_sites | monetization]] is AdSense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Estimated Income:** Could potentially be a $100,000 per month website, with a fair estimate of $60,000-$70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Monetization Beyond Ads

While display ads (AdSense) offer a highly passive income stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, there are other [[monetization_strategies_for_directory_sites | monetization strategies for directory sites]]:
*   **Selling products:** Like AtlasObscura selling a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Building Software as a Service (SaaS):** The main opportunity lies in building software on top of directories. This leverages existing traffic in a niche to create a SaaS product, generating higher multiples similar to software businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. An example is a directory of farms and CSAs that funnels traffic into their owned SaaS product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Lead generation:** Programmatic directories can sell leads to service-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.
*   **[[affiliate_programs_and_revenue_generation | Affiliate programs]]**: Especially relevant in niches like the pet space. For instance, a dog park directory could link to BarkBox's affiliate program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.
*   **Data Collection/Lead Magnets:** Collecting valuable user data through newsletters or DNA kits (as in the example of BarkBox's acquisition) can be more valuable than direct revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>.

## Finding and Validating a Niche

The first two crucial steps for any directory are finding and validating an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>.

### Keyword Research
Frey uses Ahrefs' Keyword Explorer to find ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
1.  **Search "near me":** Typing "near me" into Ahrefs reveals a long list of local queries with high search volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
2.  **Look for High Volume, Low Difficulty:** Focus on keywords with high monthly search volume and low keyword difficulty (ideally under 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Frey's sweet spot is 30,000 to 100,000 monthly searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
3.  **Avoid Certain Niches:**
    *   **Seasonal Niches:** Like "pumpkin patches near me," as monetization is limited to a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   **Difficult Data Acquisition:** Niches where data is hard to obtain (e.g., "earthquake near me") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
    *   **Big Branded Keywords:** Like "Taco Bell near me," as these brands likely already have established directories and the search intent is too one-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
4.  **Seek Fragmented Search Intent:** Look for niches where people are not satisfied with a generic search but seek specific types or features. For example, "dog parks near me" has fragmented intent with related searches like "indoor dog park," "off-leash dog park," or "dog water park" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. This allows for rich data [[seo_strategies_for_online_directories | enrichment]] and caters to specific user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

### Competitive Research
Using Google, search for keywords like "Dog Park Los Angeles" to identify existing directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. Evaluate competitors to determine if an improved directory can be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. A simple directory with high traffic (e.g., one getting 21,000 monthly visitors that only lists name and address) is a "bounty" target, indicating significant opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This suggests Google Maps isn't fully satisfying user needs, opening a gap for specialized directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

### Social Listening (Problem Validation)
Use platforms like Reddit to confirm if the chosen niche is a problem worth solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. Searching "Dog Park Los Angeles Reddit" reveals forums where people discuss challenges in finding dog parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Look for posts where users express a desire for more detailed information or curated lists, indicating a clear social signal that a problem exists (e.g., wishing for descriptions and photos, or specific features like shade or dog bags) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

## Data Acquisition and Enrichment

### Web Scraping
*   **Tool:** Frey uses OutScraper (not affiliated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Go to Google Maps and type in the target niche (e.g., "Dog Park Los Angeles") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.
    2.  Identify a dedicated Google category for the niche (e.g., "Dog Park"). This simplifies scraping and results in cleaner data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. Select "exact match" in the scraper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
    3.  If no specific category exists, use a plain query (e.g., "off leash dog parks"), though this will yield more junk data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.
    4.  Collect essential parameters like name, phone number, address, postal code, state, reviews, street view, working hours, and especially the "location link" for future [[using_ai_and_seo_to_grow_online_directories | data enrichment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:33:06]</a>.
    5.  For nationwide directories, keep the location defaulted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>.

### Data Cleaning
*   If using a plain query, significant cleaning is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.
*   **Manual Methods:** Delete listings without addresses or with very few reviews (e.g., one review) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.
*   **AI Tools:** AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude can assist, but a solid prompt is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. Manual initial cleaning is often preferred to avoid losing quality listings (e.g., "throwing the baby out with the bathwater") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

### Data Enrichment
This is crucial for making the directory better than competitors and provides specific features that users seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.
1.  **Leverage Keyword Research:** Use insights from fragmented search intent (e.g., "indoor dog park," "off-leash dog park") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
2.  **Review Google Maps Listings:** Manually click through reviews on Google Maps to identify common tags and features (e.g., "shade," "parking," "water," "benches," "dog bags," "trash cans") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
3.  **Create Columns:** Add these features as new columns in the data sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.
4.  **Automation (AI):** While manual enrichment is tedious for large datasets, tools under development can automate this process by reading Google URLs and analyzing reviews for specific keywords (e.g., "does this dog park have shade?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>. This saves immense time compared to manual entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

## Building the Directory (Static Pillar Page)

### Content Management System (CMS)
*   Any CMS can be used, but WordPress with basic themes or Framer are good options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
*   Elementor Pro was used for Frey's first directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.

### Static Pillar Page Directory
This "slept on" format is a basic, level-one directory build that performs well for [[seo_strategies_for_online_directories | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.
*   **Structure:** A single, very long page containing all content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.
    *   Header 1 (`H1`) with the main keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.
    *   Table of contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.
    *   Sections targeting city-specific keywords (e.g., "Dog Park Long Beach," "Dog Park Los Angeles") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.
    *   Each listing includes a photo, enriched data (features), basic information (address, phone, hours), and an embedded map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.
*   **SEO Advantages:**
    *   Takes advantage of high search volume keywords (location pages are often the most searched pages on directories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>.
    *   A single state page can rank for over 1,300 keywords by targeting city-specific terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>.
*   **Monetization Benefits:** Ideal for display ad [[monetization_strategies_for_directory_sites | monetization]] due to the long page format, allowing for many ad placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
*   **Internal Linking:** A simple internal linking strategy can guide users to different states or cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.

This simple format is excellent for beginners to dip their feet in the water and achieve $2,000 to $10,000 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.

## The Bigger Picture: From "Mailbox Money" to Empire
Online directories offer the potential for "mailbox money"—consistent monthly income that can cover living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. This allows individuals to focus on other pursuits or build a foundation for larger ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.

Directories are an underrated and often overlooked opportunity by tech founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>. They can be scaled into significant businesses, such as:
*   Developing a SaaS product on top of the directory (e.g., for public parks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   Creating a consumer product that competes with established brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.

The initial steps of finding an idea, validating it, and acquiring/parsing data remain the same regardless of whether one aims for a small or large venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>.

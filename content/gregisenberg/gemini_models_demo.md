This article provides an in-depth look at the capabilities of Gemini models as demonstrated by Logan Kilpatrick, lead PM for Google's [[Google AI Studio capabilities | AI Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The demonstration highlights how these models can be leveraged to build businesses and innovate with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Introduction to [[Google AI Studio capabilities | AI Studio]]

[[Google AI Studio capabilities | AI Studio]] is a platform designed to showcase the full capabilities of Google's AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. It is available for free, allowing users to explore and find differentiated features of the models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Key features of the [[Google AI Studio capabilities | AI Studio]] interface include:
*   A basic prompting experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   A Prompt Gallery offering a wide range of examples, from simple trip ideas to code optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Differentiated Capabilities of Gemini Models

The Gemini models, which power the [[Google AI Studio capabilities | AI Studio]] experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, offer several advanced capabilities.

### Long Context Processing
One of the most impressive features demonstrated is the models' ability to handle long context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Example**: The demonstration processed a 30-minute video of a Natural History Museum tour, identifying all museum exhibits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   This video equated to 531,000 tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   Such a task would be nearly impossible to accomplish without these models, requiring extensive manual effort or complex multi-step processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Business Opportunity**: This capability is highly relevant for "Startup Builders" looking to extract data from media to create online directories or other data-rich applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. It can also be used to extract intelligence from long audio files, such as podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Types of Gemini Models
[[Google AI Studio capabilities | AI Studio]] allows users to experiment with various Gemini models, each with different trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>:
*   **Flash Model**: More powerful and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Flashlight Model**: Has higher rate limits but is slightly less intelligent, capable of performing many core functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Pro Model**: An experimental variant and the most intelligent model currently available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Reasoning Model**: Represents the "New Frontier capabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. It is available for free for developers within [[Google AI Studio capabilities | AI Studio]] or via an API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Reasoning Model Capabilities
The reasoning model enables the AI to "think" before generating a final output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Code Generation Example**: A demonstration showed the model transforming a basic Python code snippet for the Gemini API into a "fully fledged website plus Landing Page Plus SAS app" called [[Google AI Studio capabilities | AI Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **"Thoughts" Feature**: During this process, the UI displayed the model's internal "thoughts," outlining desired outcomes, code structure, technology stack, landing page optimization, and MVP for SaaS functionality (e.g., user authentication, dashboard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This thinking process took 23 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   This internal "outline" mirrors the planning process a human software engineer might undertake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   Users can obtain a free API key from [[Google AI Studio capabilities | AI Studio]] to use the reasoning model in other tools like Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Starter Apps for Exploration

[[Google AI Studio capabilities | AI Studio]] provides simple starter apps to demonstrate various model capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. The code for these apps is available on GitHub for users to download, modify, and use with their free API keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.

### Spatial Understanding
This capability allows the model to deeply understand and identify objects within images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **2D Bounding Boxes**: The demo illustrated the model dynamically overlaying 2D bounding boxes on items in a picture, indicating their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   **Business Ideas**: This is valuable for applications like furniture shopping websites (identifying items in a room for reverse image search) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, inventory management (snapping pictures to track utilization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, or analyzing satellite imagery to bound specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. It can automate painful service-based tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

### Native Function Calling
Gemini models can connect with existing products through native function calling capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   **Google Maps API Integration**: A "geoguesser" experience was built by hooking up [[Google AI Studio capabilities | AI Studio]] and Gemini to the Google Maps API, allowing the model to take users to locations based on prompts like "take me somewhere in ancient history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
*   This demonstrates how combining existing products with AI can lead to new businesses with relatively little development effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

### Real-Time Streaming (Multimodal Live API)
The multimodal live API enables real-time AI co-presence, allowing the AI to "see" and understand what the user sees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
*   **Interactive Debugging Example**: A demonstration showed the AI model listening to spoken commands and observing a code editor on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. It could identify file names, offer suggestions for code changes, and debug errors (e.g., "no such file or directory," "API key not valid") by understanding the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
*   **Future of Work**: This is seen as the future of work, where an AI partner provides real-time value and intelligence, akin to a senior developer pair-programming or assisting with complex tasks like video editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. It democratizes access to assistance for people learning new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
*   The model can also integrate with tools for code execution, browsing the internet for grounding information, and providing outputs within the same product experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.
*   Users can try this experience at audio.google.com, where they can change voices and output formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

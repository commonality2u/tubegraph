[[setting_up_ai_agents_as_virtual_employees | AI employees]] are being developed on platforms like Lindy, allowing users to [[building_a_business_with_ai_tools | create thousands of AI agents]] that can help [[building_automated_businesses_with_ai | build a startup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This represents an easy way to [[setting_up_ai_agents_as_virtual_employees | create agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Benefits of [[automated_business_with_ai_assistants | AI Team Members]] and Automations

[[automated_business_with_ai_assistants | AI team members]] and [[ai_automation_tools_for_workflows | AI automations]] offer significant advantages over human employees:
*   They are "thousand times better than a human" in certain tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   They make businesses more efficient and enable faster growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   They are easier to spin up and manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   They scale infinitely, acting elastically to meet demand and scaling down when not in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   They continuously improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Cloud can perform actual work, not just generate text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   The business of the future could involve setting up a team of 5,000 [[automated_business_with_ai_assistants | AI employees]] in a weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## [[automating_business_tasks_with_ai | AI Agents]] vs. Traditional Automations

There's a significant difference between traditional automations, like those offered by Zapier, and [[automating_business_tasks_with_ai | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### AI at Any Point
Traditional automation tools often treat each step as an isolated "island" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. In contrast, [[automating_business_tasks_with_ai | AI agents]] allow the use of AI at any point in the workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. An agent is aware of the entire context of everything it has done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This means a user can simply "speak" to the agent to extract information, even if formats change, rather than needing to write complex parsing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Long-Term Task Management
While a "zap" (Zapier automation) is a "once and done" action, an [[automating_business_tasks_with_ai | AI agent]] manages long-term tasks over extended time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This enables continuous conversations with the agent via email or Slack, where the agent maintains context of past interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## [[examples_and_use_cases_of_ai_agents | Practical Applications and Examples]] with Lindy

Lindy is a platform designed to [[setting_up_ai_agents_as_virtual_employees | create AI employees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Meeting Recording and Coaching
A Lindy can be set up to:
*   Join and record meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Create Google Docs with meeting notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   Send notes and coaching feedback via Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   Provide coaching notes based on custom prompts, e.g., assessing if interactions were too confrontational or if issues were double-clicked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Maintain context to understand follow-up questions in a conversation, allowing for detailed feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Email Management
*   **Time-Sensitive Email Catcher:** A Lindy can be configured to:
    *   Trigger upon receiving an email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
    *   Use natural language conditions to determine if an email is "urgent and time sensitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
    *   Send a direct message on Slack with context about the urgent email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
    *   An [[automating_business_tasks_with_ai | AI agent]] understands the email content, e.g., recognizing a callback request for Hawaiian pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
    *   It can respond to user prompts (e.g., "tell him I'll call him right away and create a 15-minute calendar invite for 3 p.m.") by replying to the email and creating calendar events, demonstrating contextual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Reservation Tracking:** For managing property rentals, a Lindy can:
    *   Process confirmation emails (e.g., "you just made 200 bucks") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   Extract specific data like reservation date and total amount using simple prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   Append this data to a Google Sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   The agent's awareness of the entire context means it doesn't need data injected from previous steps, unlike traditional automation tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Meeting Scheduling
A Lindy meeting scheduler can:
*   Function as an [[automated_business_with_ai_assistants | AI agent]] with a global prompt to define its persona and default behaviors (e.g., signing emails as "Lindy", default meeting duration of 30 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.
*   Look at a user's calendar and suggest available times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
*   Reply in the email thread with options and send calendar invites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.
*   Handle complex scenarios like changing meeting times, deleting old calendar events, and finding new availabilities, illustrating its ability to adapt and manage long-term processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

### Recruiting and Lead Generation
A Lindy can act as a designer recruiter by:
*   Processing random information inputs (Twitter links, portfolios, names, emails) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
*   Using branches and conditions to determine the type of input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
*   Performing a "site quest" to find email addresses by checking Google Sheets, browsing Twitter links, or conducting Google searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.
*   Being given a high-level goal like "browse for a bit" and "give up after full attempt" to prevent endless loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.
*   Understanding different email formats, even if they are spelled out to avoid bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.
*   Sending initial outreach emails and follow-up reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.
*   A "lead generator Lindy" can find specific leads (e.g., product designers at Zapier) and add them to a Google Sheet or provide them in a markdown table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.
*   Agents can even find personal email addresses if prompted, demonstrating advanced capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.

### Proposal Writing
An [[automating_business_tasks_with_ai | AI agent]] (Lindy) can be created as an "expert in creating Google Docs proposals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. This agent can:
*   Be summoned by another agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   Create a Google Doc with a proposal, named and formatted as instructed (even with "broken English" prompts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   Write the proposal content using given instructions, including sections like pricing and terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   Communicate back to the summoning agent, confirming completion and providing a link to the created proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   This streamlines the proposal process, especially for smaller deals, addressing a common bottleneck in service businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.
*   Multiple proposals can be generated in parallel, as Lindy is fully parallelized and can handle thousands of tasks per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.

### Customer Support
*   An e-commerce customer uses Lindy as their customer support agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.
*   During high-demand periods like Black Friday, Lindy can scale instantly to handle an influx of 500 tickets in five minutes, providing 500 individual Lindy agents to manage the load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. This prevents operational chaos and maintains key performance indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

## Getting Started with [[how_to_automate_business_processes_with_ai | Building AI Agents]]

### Identify "Jobs to Be Done"
A good starting point is to identify repetitive tasks or "jobs to be done" within your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>. These are ideal candidates for automation with [[automating_business_tasks_with_ai | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

### Starting Simple
It's recommended to start with regular, individual Lindy agents before attempting to make agents communicate with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. Lindy provides an Academy and templates to help users get started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>.

### Advanced: Agents Working Together
[[automating_business_tasks_with_ai | AI agents]] can be programmed to send messages to and work with other agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. This is akin to object-oriented programming for agents, where one agent can delegate tasks to another specialized agent (e.g., a lead generation agent delegating to a proposal writing agent or a recruiting agent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. This allows for complex workflows and the creation of an "entire team of Lindies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

## The Future of Business: Autonomous Companies
The ability to [[setting_up_ai_agents_as_virtual_employees | create AI employees]] and have them work together opens up the possibility of [[building_automated_businesses_with_ai | building an autonomous company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. This means a single individual or a small team could manage an "army of [[automated_business_with_ai_assistants | AI recruiters]]" or other specialized agents, allowing for infinite scalability with compute resources (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. This presents an "arbitrage opportunity" as not everyone is currently leveraging this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.

## How to Access Lindy
Lindy can be accessed by signing up on their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. They require payment information upon signup but offer a seven-day free trial that can be canceled at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. Users can reach out to the founder directly via email, though an [[automating_business_tasks_with_ai | AI agent]] might respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

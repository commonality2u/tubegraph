Online directories, often overlooked, can be surprisingly profitable. They offer various strategies to generate income, ranging from passive display advertising to building integrated software solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The choice of strategy can depend on whether the goal is a lifestyle business or a larger, scalable venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## Display Advertising
Display ads, primarily through platforms like AdSense, are a common and highly passive way to [[monetizing_online_directories | monetize online directories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Examples of Ad-Based Monetization:
*   **RoadsideAmerica.com**: A directory of quirky roadside attractions in the United States, this website receives 85,000 monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. It is heavily monetized with display ads, primarily from Tier 1 traffic (US, Canada, Australia, UK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. It is estimated to generate $5,000 to $7,000 per month passively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **AtlasObscura.com**: A worldwide directory of off-the-beaten-path attractions, this site boasts 1 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. It is also monetized via display ads (AdSense) with 90-91% Tier 1 traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Conservative estimates suggest it earns around $30,000 a month from AdSense, potentially reaching $50,000 to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **FindAGrave.com**: This directory, which helps users find burial sites, attracts 1.4 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. With 92% Tier 1 traffic and AdSense as its main monetization, it could generate $60,000 to $70,000 per month, with a potential to reach $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

AdSense offers the closest experience to passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Pillar page static directories are well-suited for display ad monetization due to their length, allowing for many ad placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

## Selling Products
Beyond display ads, some directories directly sell products:
*   AtlasObscura.com also sells a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This represents an opportunity to [[monetization_strategies_beyond_ads | monetize beyond ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Building Software (SaaS) on top of Directories
A highly effective [[monetization_strategies_beyond_ads | monetization strategy]] involves using directories to generate traffic and then building software or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) on top of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   By attracting eyeballs in a specific niche, one can then create a SaaS product, potentially leveraging AI for instant development, to achieve higher business multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   A directory of farms and CSAs, for example, successfully funnels its relevant website traffic into a SaaS product it owns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This is considered an "incredibly smart" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   A dog park directory could evolve into a SaaS product for public parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.

## Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate plays are another viable option, especially in niches with related products or services:
*   In the pet space, a dog park directory could partner with companies like BarkBox, which offers an affiliate program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>. If users are looking for dog parks, they might also be interested in dog health or related products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>.

## Lead Generation and Data Collection
Directories can serve as powerful lead magnets and tools for data collection:
*   Collecting data on dog owners, potentially through a newsletter on a dog park directory, could be highly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. Companies like BarkBox were acquired for the value of their acquired data (e.g., DNA kits for dogs and cats) rather than just their annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>.
*   Programmatic directories can also be used to sell leads to service-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.

## Hybrid Models
Many successful directories employ a combination of these [[monetization_strategies_beyond_ads | monetization strategies]]:
*   A directory could combine display ads with an affiliate play and an email list/lead magnet to collect more information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.

### Key Takeaway for Monetization:
> "The choice is yours and that's why I think directory that's why I've been bringing on more and more directories onto the uh people onto the the Pod because I think that the average you know Tech founder isn't thinking about building directories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>

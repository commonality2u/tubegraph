The field of marketing is undergoing a significant transformation, moving from traditional approaches to a new paradigm known as [[introduction_to_vibe_marketing | Vibe Marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Traditional Marketing: The Old World

In the "old world" of marketing, teams were typically large and specialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. They often comprised ten or more specialists, including SEO experts, copywriters, designers, analytics professionals, and media buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. These individuals commonly worked in silos, leading to slower processes and requiring significant time, often weeks, to launch campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Historically, successful marketing also necessitated raising millions of dollars or building a substantial team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

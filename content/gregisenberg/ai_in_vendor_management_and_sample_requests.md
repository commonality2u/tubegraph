AI agents, such as Operator, can be leveraged for tasks in vendor management and sample requests, particularly for processes like sourcing products from international markets. This automation can significantly reduce manual effort and accelerate initial outreach phases.

## Automated Sample Requests

A practical application of AI in vendor management involves instructing an AI agent to request product samples from online marketplaces.

### The Process
The user provided the AI agent with a prompt to:
*   Go to AliExpress.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.
*   Find trending items on the homepage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.
*   Message 10 vendors of one of those items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   Ask for a free sample to be shipped to Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

The motivation behind this task is based on real-world sourcing practices where individuals copy and paste messages to hundreds of vendors on platforms like AliExpress or Alibaba to order free samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. The goal is to wake up with numerous tracking numbers for samples without manual intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

### Execution and Adaptability
1.  **Initial Site Access Issue**: The AI initially reported that AliExpress was "unaccessible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>, despite the site being manually accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
2.  **Finding Alternatives**: When instructed to find a comparable site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>, the AI used Bing to search for "AliExpress alternatives" and clicked on a generic AI generator website listing "11 best AliExpress alternatives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. This showcased the AI's ability to "go rogue" and figure things out by searching and navigating web pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.
3.  **Transition to Banggood.com**: The AI landed on Banggood.com, another Chinese e-commerce site, identifiable by its Chinese New Year shipping delay banner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.
4.  **Vendor Interaction**:
    *   The AI identified "BlitzWolf earbuds" as a trending item due to its prominent feature on the homepage and high ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.
    *   It drafted a message requesting a free sample for the earbuds, specifying shipment to Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
    *   The AI successfully navigated to the "ask a question" pop-up and checked the box to receive a response from the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
5.  **Account Creation**: To send the message, the AI needed to create an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.
    *   It was given an email address to use for registration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.
    *   The AI successfully generated and entered a 20-character password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
    *   It handled a registration limit error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.
    *   The user manually input a 4-digit verification code, although the AI could have potentially figured it out with more time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
    *   After logging in, the AI continued its task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.

### Potential Enhancements and Future Implications

*   **Data-Driven Sourcing**: In the future, the AI could be provided with a data set of specific trends, like Google Trend data, and instructed to only request free samples for products within those trends from sites like Banggood or AliExpress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.
*   **Cold Emailing**: The AI can perform [[creating_ai_employees | cold emailing]] by logging into a Gmail account and sending customized emails based on a provided spreadsheet of names and messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. This capability can replace dedicated cold emailing software, saving costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Screenshot Documentation**: The AI agent can take screenshots of its actions, and potentially integrate them into a Google Doc for record-keeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.

### Considerations

*   **Prompting**: Users need to be direct and commanding in their prompts, treating the AI like a machine rather than a human, to optimize performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>. Experimenting with different prompts is key to understanding its capabilities and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.
*   **Cost vs. Value**: While a $200/month subscription for an AI agent might seem expensive, it's considered an [[ai_as_a_tool_for_enhancing_productivity_and_creativity | incredible value]] given its ability to automate complex tasks that traditionally require human effort or multiple software subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>. The value is realized when users understand how to leverage it for their specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
*   **Early Adoption**: It's crucial for users to engage with these AI tools now, despite any current bugs or perceived slowness, to understand their nuances as they rapidly improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. This period is seen as one of the greatest [[agentic_approach_in_ai_business_automation | arbitrage]] moments in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

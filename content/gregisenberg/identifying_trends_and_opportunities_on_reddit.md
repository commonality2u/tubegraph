Using Reddit is presented as a highly effective method for finding validated startup ideas and for [[Methods to validate startup ideas using social media | validating startup ideas]] generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This approach can lead to multi-million dollar businesses by identifying ideas that resonate with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Process for Finding Startup Ideas

The process involves a four-step approach using specific [[tools_for_analyzing_market_trends | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>:

### Step 1: Finding Trending Subreddits

The first step is to identify what's [[Trends and antitrends in startups | trending]] within Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Tool**: Gummy Search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Feature**: Use the "trending" section to view top subreddits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Look for subreddits with 10,000 to 100,000 members, as these are often newer, trending communities that answer the "why now" question for building something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Action**: Scroll through the list, sorting by daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Consider if you have an "unfair advantage" or connection to the niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Take notes on interesting communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. It's recommended to check Gummy Search every few weeks to find new niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Step 2: Identifying Problems and Solutions

Once an interesting subreddit is selected, the next step is to find problems and potential solutions within that community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This helps in formulating a startup idea for which people would pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Tool**: Gummy Search (Audience feature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Action**:
    1.  **Create an Audience**: Add the chosen subreddit (and similar ones) to an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    2.  **Pain and Anger**: Explore the "pain and anger" category to identify common problems and patterns within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Gummy Search uses AI to summarize submissions and find common patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This helps in generating ideas for products or content that address these issues (e.g., potty training challenges, dog eating habits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
    3.  **Advice Requests**: Check the "advice requests" category to see what products or solutions people are actively asking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. These are "people screaming they want these products to exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Pay attention to upvotes and comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    4.  **Solution Requests**: Review the "solution requests" to understand the competitive landscape and what products people are already using to deal with their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Output**: Document all ideas, problems, and competitive insights in a one-pager or Google Doc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Step 3: Researching Niche Creators

To further understand the community and potential marketing avenues, research creators in the chosen niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Tool**: Perplexity.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   **Action**: Prompt Perplexity.ai to list popular or educational influencers (e.g., "25 most popular dog influencers on YouTube") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Platform**: Go to YouTube channels of these creators. Sort their videos by "most popular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Action**: Read the comments section of popular videos. This helps to understand what people want and are thinking about, putting you "in their shoes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Repeat this for 20-25 videos, noting what is learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### Step 4: Wireframing and Naming the Idea

Based on the gathered insights, develop a tangible representation of the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
*   **Action**:
    1.  **Wireframe the Website**: Sketch out or create a simple wireframe for the proposed website or service (e.g., using Framer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
    2.  **Develop a Catchy Name**: Come up with a name that is validated and resonates with the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Sometimes, a subreddit name itself can be used, or insights from the community can inspire a new category name (e.g., "design science" for a design agency that focuses on data and conversion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

## Creating Content People Will Love

Reddit can also be used to generate content ideas that will resonate with an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Tool**: Gummy Search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   **Feature**: Go to the "top content" section within the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Action**: Analyze the best-performing content to identify common patterns, effective formats (e.g., long stories, memes), and what the community cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. You can also directly ask Gummy Search questions about content preferences (e.g., "Do they love memes?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

By observing and writing down ideas from various communities on Reddit, YouTube, and TikTok, it's possible to identify validated startup ideas and build successful businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

This article outlines a detailed process for identifying validated [[ai_startup_ideas_and_market_opportunities | startup ideas]] and [[ai_opportunities_and_startup_ideas | business opportunities]] using Reddit and [[ai_tools_for_business_and_content_creation | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This methodology has been used to build multi-million dollar businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The core principle is to find validated ideas that are likely to resonate with an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Four-Step Process to Find Validated Startup Ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

### Step 1: Identify Trending Communities on Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
The first step involves using Gummy Search, an [[ai_technology_for_business_applications | AI tool]] that analyzes Reddit data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Access Gummy Search**: It is free to sign up, with a paid plan also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Navigate to the Trending Section**: This section shows top subreddits sorted by size, activity, or growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Focus on Growth Rate**: Look at how fast subreddits are growing daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Target Mid-Sized Subreddits**: Instead of focusing on massive subreddits, prioritize those with 10,000 to 100,000 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. These are often newer, trending communities that answer the "why now" question for [[building_a_business_with_ai_tools | building a business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Identify Niche Interests**: Scroll through the list and note down any subreddits that seem interesting or where you might have an unfair advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Adjust Time Frame**: Experiment with daily, weekly, or monthly growth filters to uncover different trending communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Curated Sections**: Gummy Search also offers curated sections (e.g., 26 subreddits for software engineers), which can be added to an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This step should be performed every few weeks to find new niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Step 2: Uncover Problems and Solutions within Communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>
Once a promising subreddit is identified, the next step involves using Gummy Search to find the specific problems and potential solutions within that community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Create an Audience**: In Gummy Search, add the chosen subreddit (and similar ones) to an "audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Analyze "Pain and Anger"**: Gummy Search organizes discussions into categories like "pain and anger," "advice requests," and "solution requests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Clicking "pain and anger" allows the [[ai_applications_in_business | AI]] to summarize common patterns from thousands of words submitted by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This directly reveals problems that can be addressed by a new product or service (e.g., potty training challenges, loss of appetite in dogs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Examine "Advice Requests"**: This section highlights what people are asking for advice on, often indicating unmet needs or desire for specific products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. These are "people screaming they want these products to exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Examples include dog breed recommendations or dog food recommendations for specific needs (e.g., senior dogs with dental issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Review "Solution Requests"**: This category shows existing solutions people are using, providing insights into the competitive landscape and how people currently address their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Document Findings**: Throughout this step, take notes in a Google Doc or notebook, outlining potential business ideas, competitive landscapes, and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. These can form a one-pager for your business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### Step 3: Research Niche Creators and Audience Insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>
After identifying problems, the next step is to understand the audience deeper by researching relevant content creators.
*   **Find Influencers**: Use [[ai_tools_for_business_and_content_creation | AI tools]] like Perplexity AI to find popular influencers or educators in the niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. For example, "give me the 25 most popular dog influencers on YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Analyze Creator Content**: Go to the identified creators' platforms (e.g., YouTube) and sort their videos by "most popular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Read Comments**: Critically analyze the comments section of popular videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Comments often reveal specific pain points, unmet needs, or desires not explicitly stated in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. This helps to put yourself in the audience's shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Refine Insights**: Add these insights to your one-pager document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Step 4: Wireframe and Validate the Idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>
The final step involves visualizing and testing the potential solution.
*   **Wireframe a Website**: Based on the gathered insights, create a wireframe or simple website for the proposed business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. This can be done quickly using tools like Framer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. An example shared is a design agency focused on conversion and cash flow, born from insights about designers not prioritizing business outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Choose a Catchy Name**: Select a business name that resonates with the target audience and is validated by the insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. Sometimes, a subreddit's name or a direct insight from the community (e.g., "less art, more science" for a design agency leading to "Design Scientist.com") can inspire the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Launch and Post**: Put the wireframe or simple website online and start posting about it to gauge interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

Discovering and validating [[Business ideas and revenue opportunities with AI tools | startup ideas]] can be efficiently achieved using Reddit and [[ai_tools_for_business_efficiency and automation | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This method helps find "gold" within communities, leading to validated ideas that resonate with potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## A Four-Step Process for Validated Startup Ideas

The speaker outlines a four-step process for finding new, validated [[AI applications for startup ideas | startup ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Step 1: Identify Trending Subreddits using Gummy Search

The first step involves using a tool called Gummy Search, which offers both free and paid plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Accessing Trending Data**: Navigate to the "trending" section within Gummy Search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This section displays top subreddits sorted by size, activity, and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Growth**: The key is to observe how fast subreddits are growing daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Targeting Niche Communities**: Instead of focusing on massive subreddits, it is recommended to look at those with 10,000 to 100,000 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. These are often newer, trending communities, indicating current relevance and potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Personal Connection**: As you scroll through subreddits, consider if you have an "unfair advantage" or personal connection to a topic, which could inform what you build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Note-Taking**: Maintain notes in a notebook or Google Doc of interesting subreddits and potential areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Timeframe Exploration**: Experiment with different timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly) to uncover unique insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Regularly checking Gummy Search every few weeks is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Curated Sections**: Gummy Search also offers curated sections, such as "26 subreddits for software engineers," which can be added to an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Step 2: Find Problems and Solutions within Subreddits

Once an interesting subreddit is selected, the next step is to find problems and potential solutions within that community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This helps in developing a specific [[Business Opportunities Using AI Technologies | startup idea]] for which you can charge money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

*   **Creating an Audience**: In Gummy Search, create an "audience" by adding the chosen subreddit and including similar communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Identifying Pain Points ("Pain and Anger")**:
    *   Gummy Search organizes discussions into categories like "pain and anger," "hot discussions," "advice requests," and "solution requests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   Clicking on "pain and anger" allows you to see common patterns summarized by [[AI tools and agents for business automation and decision making | AI]] within the subreddit's content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This helps in generating ideas for products or content that address these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Identifying Needs ("Advice Requests")**:
    *   The "advice requests" category reveals what people are actively asking for, such as product recommendations or guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   These requests represent explicit market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Consider how to efficiently build and market a solution to these specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
    *   Example: Questions about dog breeds or dog food recommendations can lead to [[Business ideas and revenue opportunities with AI tools | business ideas]] like a dog breed matching website or soft dog food for senior dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Understanding the Landscape ("Solution Requests")**:
    *   The "solution requests" section shows what solutions people are already using or recommending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
    *   This provides insights into the competitive landscape and how people currently address their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Documenting Insights**: Throughout this process, continue writing down ideas and competitive landscape notes in a Google Doc, forming a "one-pager" for your business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### Step 3: Identify Niche Creators and Audience Insights

After understanding problems and solutions, the next step is to find relevant creators within that niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

*   **Using [[ai_tools_for_business_efficiency_and_automation | Perplexity AI]]**: Use [[ai_tools_for_business_efficiency_and_automation | Perplexity AI]] (or similar [[AI tools and agents for business automation and decision making | AI tools]]) to prompt for top educational creators or influencers in the niche (e.g., "25 most popular dog influencers on YouTube") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   **Analyzing Creator Content**: Go to the identified creators' YouTube channels, sort videos by "most popular," and read the comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Comments provide direct insights into what the audience wants and thinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Gathering Insights**: Dedicate time to reading comments across multiple videos (around 20-25) and add new learnings to your one-pager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### Step 4: Wireframe the Website and Develop a Catchy Name

The final step in generating an idea is to visualize and name the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

*   **Wireframing**: Based on the gathered insights, wireframe out what the website or product would look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This can be done quickly using tools like Framer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   **Catchy Naming**: Come up with a catchy, validated name for your business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. Sometimes, using the subreddit's name can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. The name should resonate with the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. For example, "Design Science" emerged from the insight that people wanted designers to be more like scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

## Content Creation Strategy

The process for identifying [[AI applications for startup ideas | startup ideas]] can also be applied to creating content that resonates with an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Building a community through content is crucial for product success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

*   **Leveraging Gummy Search "Top Content"**: In Gummy Search, explore the "top content" section of your chosen audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   **Identifying Patterns and Formats**: Observe what types of content perform best, common patterns, and preferred formats (e.g., long stories, memes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. This helps in understanding what the community cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Using [[AI tools and agents for business automation and decision making | AI]] as an Assistant**: Gummy Search, and similar [[AI tools for business efficiency and automation | products]], can act as an "entrepreneurial assistant" or "co-founder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. You can ask it questions about content preferences (e.g., "Do they love memes?") to connect dots and generate content ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

This methodology, which combines observing communities on platforms like Reddit and YouTube with the analytical capabilities of [[AI tools and agents for business automation and decision making | AI tools]], helps in discovering validated [[Business opportunities using AI technologies | business opportunities]] and [[framework for identifying profitable AI SaaS opportunities | startup ideas]] that have a high chance of resonating with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. This approach has led to multi-million dollar businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

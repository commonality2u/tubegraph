From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Starting an online directory is presented as a low-risk way to [[starting_an_online_business_in_the_current_digital_landscape | start a startup]] with significant earning potential, with some operators making $5K, $10K, $15K, or even $20K per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Directories are currently experiencing a "Golden Era" due to a growing demand for curated content online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. As the internet becomes saturated with content, users increasingly trust directories for well-curated, high-quality information, effectively outsourcing decision-making from Google searches to trusted directory platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## [[finding_and_validating_a_niche_for_a_directory | Finding and Validating an Idea]]

The best approach to [[finding_and_validating_a_niche_for_a_directory | finding a directory idea]] is through keyword research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Keyword Research
Use tools like Google Keyword Planner to see what people are searching for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This helps determine if there's existing demand for a particular topic, even if you personally believe an idea is strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. For example, searching "business ideas" reveals nearly 1 million searches per month with low competition for ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Domain Name Selection
After identifying a high-traffic keyword, aim for a domain name that matches the keyword as closely as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. While an exact match is ideal (e.g., `nextjsstarters.com` for "Next.js starters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>), Google now prioritizes the *meaning* of keywords over exact word matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This means you can replace words with synonyms (e.g., "small" with "tiny," "micro," or "mini") to find available domain names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. John Rush bought "minibusinessideas.com" for $9 after finding "businessideas.com" was taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Avoid buying expensive domains; creativity can help you find affordable, relevant ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Building the Directory

The "worst way" to build a directory is by coding it from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Even for experienced developers, [[building_an_online_directory_using_wordpress | no-code platforms]] are highly recommended because they allow for faster launching and easier future marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Why No-Code?
No-code tools and web builders often come with built-in features for:
*   **Faster Launch**: Utilizing templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: Marketing pages, A/B testing, and blog functionalities are often out-of-the-box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Programmatic SEO**: Many modern CMS platforms support this out of the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Ease of Management**: It's easier to hire external help (e.g., on Upwork) to write and publish content without needing a developer to hardcode every change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

John Rush specifically uses Unicorn Platform, which has pivoted to focus on directory building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Approach
For the first launch, avoid overcomplicating things with too many features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The most important thing is to have items listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Features like ratings or user profiles will be empty initially and can be added later (even months or a year down the line) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Start with a simple page that lists names and items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### [[using_ai_in_online_directory_creation_and_growth | Using AI in Directory Creation]]
AI can significantly speed up the initial setup of a directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. AI can generate:
*   Menu structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>
*   Main text and subtitles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>
*   Featured ideas sections, which provide more text for [[seo_strategies_for_online_directories | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>
*   FAQ sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>

## Growing and Promoting the Directory

The entire process, from building to initial promotion and SEO setup, should ideally take no more than two evenings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. This rapid deployment allows for testing multiple ideas quickly, as there's a high chance any single idea might fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. It's recommended to test 5-10 ideas simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

### Initial Promotion
1.  **Reddit**: Search Google for relevant Reddit articles (e.g., "small business ideas Reddit") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. Reply to posts where users ask for recommendations or resources, being careful not to appear spammy to avoid bans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
2.  **Other Directories**: List your directory on other relevant directories to gain traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
3.  **Social Media**: Search for questions related to your directory's niche on platforms like Twitter and reply with your directory's link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. Google considers backlinks from social media, especially viral posts, as highly valuable for SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

### [[seo_strategies_for_online_directories | SEO Strategy]]
SEO is crucial for directory growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

*   **FAQ Optimization**: Each title in your FAQ section should be a possible question people search for on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Use Google's autocomplete suggestions (e.g., typing "how to start a" to see common queries) to find relevant questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **AI for Content Generation**: [[using_ai_in_online_directory_creation_and_growth | AI can generate]] initial content for FAQ answers or directory items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Iterative Content Creation**: Start with simple FAQ items. Monitor Google Search Console for keywords that bring traffic, and if a keyword is performing well, then invest more human time into creating a full, detailed page for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Content Volume**: For new sites with low domain ratings, limit articles to a maximum of 50 pages in the first month to avoid being flagged as spam by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. Aim for about 10 articles initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **AI-Powered SEO Tools**: Tools can scrape your directory, understand its content, and suggest SEO ideas like new article topics based on keyword research and traffic potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. These tools can also generate article outlines and even full articles, although human moderation is recommended to ensure quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

## Iterating and Improving Data Quality

After initial promotion and SEO setup (which should take a couple of days), step back and wait 30 days to observe traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

### Validation Phase (First 30 Days)
The first month is purely for [[validating_and_promoting_online_directory_ideas | validating potential SEO traffic]] and general interest from people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. If there's no traffic after this period, it's difficult to fix fundamentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. It's better to abandon the idea and move to another of your tested concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. Never "fall in love" with a directory idea; instead, treat it as one of several bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>.

### Data Quality (After 30 Days)
Once an idea shows promise with traffic, the next crucial phase is to focus on data quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. This is where many directories fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. Experts in your niche will quickly assess if your data is high quality and if you understand the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

*   **Expert Trust**: High-quality, well-curated data earns trust from experts and influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Organic Sharing**: When influencers or experts share your directory with their audience, it can lead to significant organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.
*   **Staying Current**: Continuously monitor the space (e.g., by scrolling Twitter) for new, hot items and add them to your directory quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Being early to list trending items can capture traffic from Google searches for those new topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

## [[monetization_strategies_for_online_directories | Monetization Strategies]]

Once a directory gains significant traffic (e.g., 50,000 unique visitors per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>), several [[monetization_strategies_for_online_directories | strategies]] can be employed:

1.  **Direct Sponsorships/Banner Spots**:
    *   **B2B Directories**: Easiest to monetize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. Pitch businesses with the same audience as your directory for banner ads or featured spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. (e.g., GPT directories charging GPT owners to be featured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>).
2.  **Affiliate Links**:
    *   Works well if the items listed in your directory are expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. Small-cost items generate little money unless there are many clicks, but high-cost items ($500+) can provide good income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>.
3.  **Selling Data/Insights**:
    *   Sell anonymized data or insights to corporates interested in trends, percentages, or distributions within your niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Be careful not to sell private user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.
4.  **Paid Listings (Paywall for Listing)**:
    *   Charge individuals or businesses to be listed in the directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. This is effective for directories where listings hold significant value (e.g., nannies paying to be listed for $50-$500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>).
5.  **Paid Access (Paywall for Users)**:
    *   Charge users for full access to the directory's content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. For example, show limited information (e.g., top 5 listings, no contact data) and require payment for complete access to the database or contact information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. Access can be for a month or for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.
6.  **Brand Sponsors**:
    *   For large directories, attract big companies that seek brand promotion rather than direct traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. They pay for affiliation (e.g., "Sponsored by Superbase") on an ongoing basis because the directory's traffic continues to grow, and these sponsorships are less intrusive than traditional banners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
7.  **Channeling Traffic to Your Own Products**:
    *   Use directories as a primary channel to drive traffic to your other projects, such as SaaS tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. It's often easier to gain SEO traffic for directories (which compete for non-competitive keywords) than for SaaS tools with random brand names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.
8.  **Selling the Directory**:
    *   Sell the directory itself to companies, especially those with SaaS tools, that want to acquire targeted traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. This is considered a highly effective marketing acquisition strategy for SaaS companies, often cheaper than newsletter ads or other channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.

## Selling Directories

There is no fixed system for valuing directories, as multiples are not usually based on revenue (which can be low) but on audience type and traffic quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
*   **Price Ranges**: Deals can start from $2K for smaller directories, average around $15K-$20K, and go up to $100K for larger ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>.
*   **Marketplaces**: Small marketplaces like Micron.io list directories for sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.
*   **Direct Outreach**: A recommended method is to use tools like Similarweb to research directory traffic and audience, then directly reach out to founders with an offer to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. This can often lead to better deals than buying from founders who have already listed their directory for sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.

## Expected Scale and Risk

Online directories are presented as a low-risk venture, especially compared to starting a SaaS business, which has a much higher failure rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   **Potential Earnings**: It's common to reach $5K MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) without significant luck or unique intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>. Reaching $10K-$15K MRR is achievable, with $20K likely being the upper limit for a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.
*   **Stability**: If a B2B directory achieves stable traffic of 5,000 visits per month, it can typically sell 4-5 ads and generate $3K-$4K per month, and this income tends to grow over time due to SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.
*   **Low Failure Rate**: If enough directories are launched and worked on for about six months, failure is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.
*   **Learning Curve**: Starting with a directory provides faster feedback loops (traffic, sponsors) compared to SaaS, making it a good entry point into building digital products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>.

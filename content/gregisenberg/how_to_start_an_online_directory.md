Starting an online directory is presented as a low-risk way to launch a startup, with individuals potentially earning thousands of dollars monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Directories are currently in a "Golden Era" due to a growing demand for curated content online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. As internet content proliferates, the quality and curation provided by directories become increasingly vital, building trust among users who seek reliable information beyond general search engine results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Key Steps to Building a Successful Online Directory

John Rush outlines a three-step process for building successful directories:
1.  Coming up with and validating ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
2.  Building the directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
3.  Working on [[seo_optimization_for_directory_websites | SEO]] after building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Finding and Validating Ideas

The best way to start an online directory is by conducting keyword research to determine if people are searching for specific terms or phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

*   **Google Keyword Planner**: This tool, typically used for ad planning, can also identify traffic for various keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The goal is to find keywords with high search volume and low competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Domain Name Selection**: Aim for a domain name that closely matches your target keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. While exact matches like `businessideas.com` are likely taken, leverage Google's shift to understanding meaning over exact word matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. For example, "mini business ideas" can serve as a substitute for "small business ideas" if the meaning is similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Purchase inexpensive domains, typically around $9, by being creative with alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Rapid [[validating_and_testing_directory_ideas | Validation]]**: Instead of focusing on a single idea, it's recommended to test five, six, or even ten ideas simultaneously to increase the chances of success and mitigate disappointment from individual failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

### Building the Directory

Avoid coding a directory from scratch, even if you are a developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **No-code First Approach**: Using no-code platforms allows for faster launches and provides out-of-the-box features for marketing, A/B testing, blogging, and programmatic [[seo_strategies_for_online_directories | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Hardcoding can lead to manual, time-consuming updates and difficulties in outsourcing content creation later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Unicorn Platform**: This tool, originally a website builder, has pivoted to a directory builder due to its common use for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Start Simple**: For the first launch, focus only on the essential items of the directory. Features like ratings or user accounts don't make sense with no initial content or users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. A simple page with names and items is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **[[using_ai_and_seo_to_grow_online_directories | Using AI to Generate Content]]**: Tools can help generate basic directory elements like menus, text, and structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. While AI-generated content needs moderation, it significantly speeds up the initial setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
    *   **FAQ for SEO**: Use the "People Also Ask" section of Google search results or search for common questions (e.g., "how do I...") to find frequently asked questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Each FAQ title can be a potential Google search query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. Answer these questions briefly, and if a keyword performs well, then create a dedicated, detailed page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

### Growing and Promoting the Directory

After building, focus on promoting the directory.
*   **Reddit**: Search Reddit for relevant articles where users ask for resources or ideas related to your directory's topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. Reply with your directory's URL, being careful to adhere to subreddit rules and Reddit's own anti-spam policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.
*   **Other Directories**: Submit your directory to other relevant directories to gain traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **Social Media**: Actively search social media for questions related to your directory's content and reply with your link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. Backlinks from popular social media posts can be highly valuable for [[seo_optimization_for_directory_websites | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.
*   **SEO**: Only after initial promotion brings some traffic and validates the idea should you invest heavily in [[seo_strategies_for_online_directories | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.
    *   **Automated [[seo_strategies_for_online_directories | SEO]] Tools**: Tools can scrape your directory, research keywords, and suggest content ideas based on potential traffic and complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. These tools can even generate outlines and articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.
    *   **Content Pacing**: For a fresh site with a low domain rating, limit new articles to a maximum of 50 in the first month to avoid being flagged as spam by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. Start with around 10 articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

> "If it takes you more than one evening then you're doing it wrong because if it takes more than one evening you need to redo your method otherwise you're kind of riding on a small car on a on a slow car and you will never get really far with that so you have to make sure that you're moving fast because there's a chance that everything I've done will fail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>

### Iterating and Improving: Focus on Data Quality

After 30 days, evaluate which directory ideas are gaining traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>. If there's no traffic, it's difficult to fix fundamentally, so move on to other ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Data Quality**: Once a directory shows promise, the primary focus shifts to the quality of its data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. Experts in a niche will quickly discern the quality of your content and whether you genuinely understand the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.
*   **Influencer Shares**: High-quality, curated data can lead to influencers sharing your directory with their audience, generating significant organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.
*   **Stay Updated**: Continuously monitor the space for new, trending items and add them to your directory quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. Being early to list hot items can capture significant [[building_passive_income_through_online_directories | passive income]] from Google searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## [[monetization_strategies_for_directory_sites | Monetization Strategies for Directory Sites]]

Several methods exist for [[monetizing_online_directories | monetizing online directories]]:

1.  **Banner/Sponsor Spots**: Effective for B2B directories where businesses target the same audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. Charge businesses to be featured at the top of listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.
2.  **Affiliate Links**: Works well if the listed items are expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. For example, a directory of software boilerplates can generate good income if the products cost hundreds or thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.
3.  **Selling Data/Insights**: Sell anonymized data or insights to corporates interested in trends, percentages, or distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
4.  **Paywall for Listings**: Charge users or businesses to list their items in the directory. This is particularly effective for service-based directories like nannies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
5.  **Paywall for Access**: Offer top listings or limited information for free, but charge a fee for full access to the database, including contact details or extended profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.
6.  **Brand Sponsors**: For larger directories, secure ongoing sponsorships from big companies that seek brand promotion and affiliation with your audience, rather than just clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. This often provides stable, recurring revenue and is less intrusive to users than traditional banners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.
7.  **Channeling Traffic to SaaS Tools**: Instead of directly gaining SEO traffic for a SaaS tool (which is harder due to brand names and competitive keywords), create directories that rank well for non-competitive keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. Then, funnel this traffic to your SaaS product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
8.  **Selling the Directory**: Directories can be sold to SaaS companies or other businesses that share the same target audience. This is considered an excellent marketing strategy for SaaS companies, offering a better ROI than other channels like newsletter ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: Directory valuations are not systematically defined by revenue, but rather audience relevance and traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. Deals can range from $2,000 for small ones, $15,000-$20,000 for average ones, and up to $100,000 for larger ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>.
    *   **Marketplaces**: While large marketplaces like Acquire.com may not list them due to revenue requirements, smaller marketplaces like Micron.io often feature directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.
    *   **Direct Outreach**: A more effective approach is to use tools like Similarweb to research traffic and audience, then directly offer to buy a directory from the founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.

## Scale and Long-Term Vision

Directories are considered a low-risk way to start a digital business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.
*   **Income Potential**: An average directory can realistically achieve $5,000 MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) without significant luck or extraordinary effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. With more time investment, this can reach $15,000-$20,000 MRR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.
*   **Side Project vs. Main Project**: Directories are ideal as side projects that can fund one's life or serve as a stepping stone into building digital products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.
*   **Low Failure Rate**: Unlike SaaS, where failure is common, it's hard to fail with directories if enough are launched and consistent effort is applied for a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>. Stable traffic from non-competitive keywords can provide a steady income, even if little is done to maintain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>.
*   **Growth Potential**: While often side projects, some directories, like Starter Story or early Product Hunt, have grown into multi-million dollar businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.

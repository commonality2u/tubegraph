The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new avenues for [[building_businesses_with_ai_technology | business opportunities in the AI and automation space | business creation]], particularly through the development of AI-powered applications. These applications often act as "wrappers" around existing AI models like ChatGPT, focusing them on specific niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. However, their sustainability and inherent risks are key considerations for entrepreneurs and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

## Current Landscape of AI-Powered Apps

A prominent example of a [[successful_ai_applications_and_startups | successful AI application]] is Plug AI (also referred to as Riz app), an AI dating coach built on ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This app reportedly generates $190,000 per month and has 333,000 downloads monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The 23-year-old co-founder of the company, AI Riz, has launched three such apps, collectively approaching $500,000 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

These apps provide various forms of "AI coaching" across different verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>:
*   **Plug AI (Texting Assistant)**: Helps users respond to messages, offering pickup lines based on screenshots of text conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Astra (Life Advice)**: Assists with life's challenges, compatibility, personal growth, and understanding dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Pallet (Style and Makeup)**: Uses AI to determine a user's color season and generate personalized style and makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

The success of these apps is attributed to leveraging existing AI technology, strong branding, and focused positioning within specific niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_building_a_sustainable_ai_startup | Sustainability and Risks]]

Despite impressive revenue figures, these businesses face notable [[challenges_of_building_a_sustainable_ai_startup | challenges of building a sustainable AI startup | challenges]] and risks:

### Reliance on Underlying AI Models
A primary risk is the dependence on foundational AI models like OpenAI's GPT. If OpenAI were to drastically increase their charges (e.g., 50x) or cease supporting third-party applications, it could significantly impact or even terminate these businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.

### Competition
The AI application space is highly competitive, with numerous new products emerging daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. This means a "flash in the pan" scenario is possible, where initial success might be short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

### Diversification as a Strategy
One way to mitigate risks is through diversification. The founder of AI Riz operates three distinct apps in different niches, reducing the impact if one app fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

### Profitability
Despite reliance on external platforms, these businesses can be highly profitable. Even with Apple taking a third of revenue, profit margins are estimated to be 65% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. A business making $500,000 in monthly revenue could see $350,000 in monthly profit, potentially accumulating $4 million in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

## Business Philosophy: Practicality Over Grand Vision

The focus for many entrepreneurs in this space is often on achieving financial stability and personal goals, rather than exclusively aiming to "change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. Generating a substantial profit, even from a potentially short-lived venture, can provide the "base of capital" necessary for future endeavors, such as retiring parents or buying a first house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. The skills acquired in running these businesses, such as marketing and brand positioning, are highly transferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

## The "Anti-Trend" Opportunity

While AI-powered apps represent a significant trend, an "anti-trend" also presents [[business_opportunities_in_the_ai_and_automation_space | opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. As AI automates various coaching and assistance services, there's a growing demand for human-led alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. These human services can command a premium price and may even be more sustainable in the long run due to less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. An AI app, for instance, could offer a premium upgrade that incorporates human coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

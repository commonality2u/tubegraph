Leveraging AI to create ads that convert can significantly increase your return on ad spend (ROAS) and contribute to a profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The ability to prompt AI models like [[AI tools for video and image generation | ChatGPT 4o]] for winning visual content is incredibly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Key AI Models for Ad Creation

### [[AI tools for video and image generation | ChatGPT 4o]]
[[AI tools for video and image generation | ChatGPT 4o]] is a new image model that allows for the creation of ads ready for an ad account in about two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. It functions as a multimodal language model, not just a pure image model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This means that prompting is less critical, and you can be quite straightforward with your requests, as it has a strong understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

### Sora
Sora is another powerful AI model for image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. It uses the same underlying model as [[AI tools for video and image generation | ChatGPT 4o]] but features an "explore page" where users can view images and their corresponding prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. This page is an excellent resource for understanding effective prompting techniques and for ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. Sora is also noted for having less strict policy guidelines and potentially better photorealism results compared to other models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

## Core Strategy: Leveraging Reference and Product Images
The most crucial elements for creating effective ads with AI are the inspiration images and the product images you provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### When to Use Reference Images
Providing an inspiration ad and your own custom product image allows for highly consistent and reliable ad creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. For example, for a Jones Road Beauty ad, a prompt might simply state to add a product image overlapping the bottom of an inspiration ad with a heading and subheading below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The AI is intelligent enough to follow these instructions precisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This method is ideal for adjusting or making edits to existing ad concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

### When Not to Use Reference Images
AI models have a strong understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge wallets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. If your product is new, small, or lacks significant online presence (millions of dollars in ad spend), you should always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. However, for globally recognized brands, the AI can generate accurate representations without a specific product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

## Generating Photorealistic Images and Specific Ad Styles

### Achieving Photorealism
To ensure images appear realistic, use keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" in your prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. Without these keywords, the AI might default to cartoonish appearances or unusual colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

### Detailed Prose Descriptions
For ads without reference images, a detailed prose description of the desired image is essential. This can include specific actions, settings, and visual elements. For example, an Adidas ad might describe "a female runner captured in mid-stride running laterally in the foreground, wearing her performance gear," with "the Egyptian desert with the pyramids" in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

### Incorporating Specific Styles and Elements
AI can also understand and replicate specific design elements:
*   **Font Types:** For well-known fonts (e.g., Exo2 bold italic), AI can produce decent representations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.
*   **Color Styles and Aspect Ratios:** You can specify color palettes and aspect ratios (e.g., 1:1, 9:16) within the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.
*   **Ad Concept Changes:** AI can adapt existing ad concepts to new themes, such as changing a Black Friday Ridge wallet ad to a Christmas style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>.

## Prompting Best Practices for Ad Creation

*   **Clarity and Directness:** Be very clear and direct about what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.
*   **New Chat for Adjustments:** If an initial prompt doesn't yield the desired result, start a new chat to make adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to worse results because the AI references its own generated image, which may have inherent flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
*   **Specify Language:** When generating text, explicitly prompt the AI to write in English to avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>.
*   **"Generate the Image":** To ensure the AI consistently produces images rather than descriptive text, include "generate the image" in your prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>.
*   **Anticipate Consistency:** AI models like [[AI tools for video and image generation | ChatGPT 4o]] tend to have a low "temperature" (randomness), meaning similar prompts will generally yield similar responses and visual styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>.

## Benefits of AI in Ad Creation
[[AI tools for video and image generation | AI tools for video and image generation]] offer significant advantages in ad creation:

*   **Speed and Scale:** Ads can be created in minutes, allowing for rapid experimentation at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. With API availability, 100 ads could be generated in five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   **Experimentation:** The ability to quickly generate numerous ad variations (e.g., different characters, ages, genders) helps determine what converts best for different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. This is crucial as the "ad is the targeting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
*   **Personalization and Creativity:** AI allows for highly personalized and entertaining ads, enabling companies to take advantage of short-term news cycles or specific events (e.g., "National Hot Dog Day" or birthdays) by rapidly producing relevant content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>.
*   **Efficiency:** AI shortens the "time to value" by streamlining the creative process and providing new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

While some might consider this approach "dirty" due to remixing existing ad concepts, it's a practice already widespread in the industry, where companies use inspiration ads and templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. AI simply makes this process more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

## Ad Inspiration Resources
To find ad inspiration and templates, consider using tools like:
*   Creative OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>
*   ForPlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>
*   Icon.me <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:00]</a>

These tools often read in Meta's ad library, tag content, and make it searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>.

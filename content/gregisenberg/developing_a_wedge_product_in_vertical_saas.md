A "wedge product" is defined as a "get in the door" product in [[understanding_vertical_saas_business_models | vertical SaaS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>. While the ultimate goal for a [[understanding_vertical_saas_business_models | vertical SaaS]] company might be to become an all-in-one, "one-stop shop" solution, it is not practical to start there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. Attempting to build an extensive, all-encompassing solution from the outset is often seen as unrealistic by investors, as it could take years and hundreds of millions of dollars, resulting in a shallow feature set across many areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

Instead, the typical and recommended approach is to identify a specific, critical problem within an industry and solve it with a focused "wedge product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.

## Characteristics of an Effective Wedge Product

A successful wedge product should possess the following qualities:
*   **Addresses a Pain Point**: It should target an area where operations are currently inefficient, potentially still on paper, or managed with poor existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **High Importance to Customer**: The problem it solves must be genuinely significant to the customer's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.
*   **Ease of Implementation**: It should be quick and easy for customers to implement and deploy, avoiding lengthy 12-month implementation cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
*   **Reputation Prover**: The wedge product serves as a "reputation prover," demonstrating value and building trust with the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. Many wedge products fail because their strategic role isn't fully considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.
*   **Marketing-Led Acquisition (Ideally)**: While not always possible, an ideal wedge product facilitates customer acquisition through marketing-led or product-led approaches, which are generally faster than sales-led models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

## Example: Roofer.com

Roofer.com provides a strong case study for a successful wedge product in the roofing industry, a large market with a healthy mix of small, mid-market, and enterprise businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

Instead of trying to build an all-in-one solution immediately, Roofer.com launched with a proposal tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. This tool used Google Maps to provide initial roofing estimates, allowing customers to get real-time quotes (subject to physical inspection) and book services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.

Key aspects of Roofer.com's wedge product strategy:
*   **Free for Users**: The tool was free for roofing companies, who paid a percentage of the booking fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>. This meant no upfront cost for the roofing company and added revenue on top of their existing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
*   **Digital Acquisition**: Roofer.com was able to acquire customers through digital marketing channels like Instagram and Facebook ads, which is uncommon for Home Services industries typically reliant on heavy sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
*   **Customer Experience Improvement**: It offered a convenient digital experience for the end customer, eliminating the need for an immediate in-person visit for an initial quote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.
*   **Trust Builder**: By helping roofing companies close deals, Roofer.com established itself as a valuable partner, building significant trust with its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

## Expanding from the Wedge

Once the wedge product has established a foothold and built trust, the company can then expand its offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>. Roofer.com, for example, then launched a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system, moving along the full life cycle of roofing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>. The next step could be an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, eventually leading to an all-in-one solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

### Incorporating Payments

A critical strategy for scaling [[understanding_vertical_saas_business_models | vertical SaaS]] companies rapidly is to integrate payments into the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. Every major industry-specific software company often owns the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

For instance, Toast, a [[understanding_vertical_saas_business_models | vertical SaaS]] company for restaurants, significantly expanded its market size by incorporating payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. While charging a small monthly fee per restaurant might only lead to a market size of $120 million (for 1 million restaurants at $10/month), by taking a percentage of the trillion dollars in revenue processed by those restaurants, the market opportunity becomes vastly larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.

If a wedge product can position itself either before or after the core transaction of the business, it opens the door to eventually capturing that transaction and embedding [[implementing_payments_in_vertical_saas_solutions | payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>. For example, a trade school software (like Corsky) that students use daily for clocking in/out and tracking skills, can then integrate [[implementing_payments_in_vertical_saas_solutions | payments]] for tuition, simplifying financial operations for the school compared to using separate systems like PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. [[implementing_payments_in_vertical_saas_solutions | Vertical-specific payments]] represent a significant opportunity for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.

The ability to [[use_of_ai_tools_in_ad_creation | create winning ads with AI]] can significantly increase return on ad spend (ROAS) and business profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This requires knowing how to effectively prompt AI models like ChatGPT 4o, a new image model generating significant buzz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Experts in creating winning ads, memes, and visual content with ChatGPT 4o can demonstrate how to generate ad-account-ready ads in about two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Leveraging ChatGPT 4o for Ad Creation

Unlike image models such as Midjourney, Flux, or Ideogram, ChatGPT 4o is a multimodal language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This means prompting is less critical, as it has a better understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The key to [[optimizing_ad_performance_with_ai | creating effective ads]] with ChatGPT 4o lies in providing high-quality inspiration images and product images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### The Role of Inspiration and Product Images

The general advice for [[using_ai_for_copy_and_ad_creative_generation | creating ads]] is to provide an inspiration ad that you want to adjust or use, alongside your own custom product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. For example, a basic prompt like "add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" can yield excellent results because GPT 4o is an intelligent model that understands intentions well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Providing an inspiration ad and custom imagery enables the creation of super consistent and reliable ads by allowing simple edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Tailoring Ads for Audiences

AI tools allow for extensive experimentation by generating diverse audience images (e.g., different genders, ages, ethnicities) to see what converts best for various target audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. ChatGPT is excellent at [[creating_art_with_ai_and_blending_aesthetics_in_midjourney | creating photorealistic images]] of different audiences, or users can upload their own photoshoot images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. When the API becomes generally available, it will be trivial to generate hundreds of ads for different audiences in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This capability allows marketers to experiment at scale, which is crucial for determining what specific visual elements drive higher conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### When to Use Reference Images (or Not)

A crucial understanding for these models is their grasp of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge Wallets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. If your product is new, small, or lacks significant online presence (millions in ad spend monthly), you should always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. However, for globally recognized brands like Adidas, the AI can generate relevant ads without a direct reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

Using keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" is vital for achieving photorealism, preventing the AI from defaulting to cartoonish or oddly colored outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Detailed prose descriptions of the desired image are also effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. For well-known fonts, the AI will have a decent understanding, and users can experiment with different font types, color styles, and aspect ratios within the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Sourcing Inspiration: Sora

Sora is an excellent resource for [[effective_content_creation_using_ai_for_marketing | ad ideation]] and understanding how successful prompts work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. It uses the same underlying model as ChatGPT 4o but features an explore page where users can view images and their corresponding prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Sora may also have less strict policy guidelines and better photorealism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

By clicking on any image, users can see the prompt and even remix or edit it, adjusting the prompt or aspect ratio, or uploading their own reference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This tool helps get "creative faucet going" and can shorten the time to value by providing ideas and prompt elements (like "hyper realistic") that users might not think of otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Prompting Best Practices

For [[adjusting_and_optimizing_aigenerated_ads | effective prompting]], be clear and direct in your instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. If the initial prompt doesn't yield desired results, it's generally better to start a new chat rather than continuing in the same conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This is because the AI uses the previously generated (and potentially flawed) image as a reference, which can lead to worse results over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Starting a new chat with adjustments ensures the images remain consistent but incorporate the improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## Examples of Ad Design Evolution

AI enables rapid evolution of ad concepts:

*   **Product Swapping**: An Athletic Greens ad was recreated using a Rise ad as inspiration. The prompt instructed the AI to "recreate this ad for AG1, adjust the background to better fit athletic green style, change the price... and generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This demonstrates how to transfer an ad's aesthetic and layout to a new product, even adjusting specific elements like pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This process of remixing existing successful ads is already common practice in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Concept Changes**: A Ridge Wallet Black Friday ad was transformed into a Christmas-themed ad by simply providing a new product image and the prompt "swap it out and change it to a Christmas style ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. This highlights the power of reference images in reducing the need for strict prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
*   **Timely and Topical Ads**: Companies can now leverage current events or news cycles quickly. An ad for Rippling was created as an "old Wall Street Journal style newspaper ad" that humorously referenced a recent controversy, showcasing how AI can produce clever, funny copy and adapt to moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. This was previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

## Sources for Ad Inspiration

To find ad inspiration, marketers can use tools that read and tag the Meta Ad Library, making it easy to search for templates and concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. Recommended sources include:
*   Creative OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>
*   ForPlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   icon.me <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>

## Live Ad Creation Example: LCA

To demonstrate, an ad was created for "LCA," a design agency specializing in [[using_ai_for_creating_production_ready_designs | AI interfaces and building AI-first products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

The process involved:
1.  **Capturing Brand Elements**: Screenshots were taken of the company's logo, typography (bolding and italics), color scheme, and client logos (Dropbox, Salesforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
2.  **Choosing Inspiration**: A vintage Rolex ad was selected as inspiration to convey a "luxury" and exclusive vibe, fitting LCA's high-end client base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
3.  **Initial Prompting**: The prompt provided context about LCA ("SWAT team design agency only for the most interesting brands on the planet helping them with building AI first tools") and included the brand screenshots and the Rolex inspiration ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. It also specified to "generate the image" to avoid text-only outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
4.  **First Generation**: The AI generated an ad with the desired "luxury vibe" and strong copy like "Leaders at billion dollar Brands choose LCA to Define their future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. However, it incorporated the Rolex watch from the inspiration image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.
5.  **Iteration (New Chat)**: To correct the unwanted Rolex, a new chat was started (as recommended for [[adjusting_and_optimizing_aigenerated_ads | prompt adjustments]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. The new prompt instructed the AI to "show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images" instead of generating a watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
6.  **Second Generation**: The AI produced an ad featuring LCA's logo, subheading, and client logos (though it did hallucinate one client, Disney, that LCA doesn't work with) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. The visual style and messaging were consistent with the desired luxury aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

This example highlights that while initial generations might not be perfect, AI significantly shortens the design process and allows for rapid iteration and refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. More specific prompting can guide the AI to exact desired layouts, text placements, and logo inclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

## The Future of Ad Creation

The current "game" in ad creation is about finding an aesthetic not yet used in a specific niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. [[Use of AI Tools for Design and Branding | AI enables]] ads to become more personal, funny, and entertaining, driven by the creativity of the "idea people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. It is an incredible time to [[the_evolution_of_writing_and_content_creation_with_ai | create memes]], ads, and creative content that stands out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

Aspect ratios can be specified in prompts (e.g., 1:1, 9:16) for different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. While not pure video, AI-generated images can be animated into video content for platforms that favor video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. Tools like Runway and Sora can be explored for more advanced video capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.

For AI startups, acquiring users is a critical phase following product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. The landscape for user acquisition has evolved, moving beyond traditional paid advertising models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

## Evolving Ad Strategies

Historically, a "golden age" existed where highly targeted ads on platforms like Facebook could effectively reach early adopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>. However, this approach has become less effective due to auction saturation and diminished tracking capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

## Building in Public and Organic Growth

Modern [[marketing_strategies_for_ai_products | marketing strategies for AI products]] often involve "building in public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. This means introducing the product early, often with a waitlist, and allowing friends and early users to try it and provide feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

A product's "launch" can be a continuous process, starting from early access through various stages like App Store release or waitlist removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. Engaging with the community by posting screenshots, animations, and finding interested individuals globally helps drive organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. For instance, a product that went viral in Kenya had hundreds of people who already loved it, and co-founders engaged directly with users at conferences, fostering a sense of co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.

## Platform-Specific Strategies

Effective [[tips_for_effective_aidriven_marketing_strategies | AI-driven marketing strategies]] require tailoring content and interaction to specific platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>:

*   **TikTok:** For broad audiences, analyze trending clips and emulate successful formats that the algorithm favors to achieve viral reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. This includes reverse-engineering viral short-form videos and creating content for micro-influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.
*   **Twitter (X):** Ideal for targeting tech-savvy individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
*   **LinkedIn:** Best for reaching sales professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.

On any platform, behaving in a way that is native to its format, language, and interaction style is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>.

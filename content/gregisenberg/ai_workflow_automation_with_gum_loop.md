[[building_powerful_no_code_ai_workflows | Gum Loop]] is an AI agent and AI automation company that recently raised $9 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The software is designed to [[role_of_ai_in_automating_manual_processes | automate what a junior employee does]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It is relevant for businesses of all sizes, from large companies to solo entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The goal is to enable users to [[building_powerful_no_code_ai_workflows | build super powerful AI workflows]] and deploy them for various AI actions with data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## How Gum Loop Workflows Operate

A gum Loop workflow is a series of connected steps where data is passed from one "node" to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The platform uses a visual, drag-and-drop canvas for building these workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Core Components

*   **Nodes**: These are the building blocks of a workflow. They can represent integrations, AI steps, or custom functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Data Flow**: Users connect nodes to pass data seamlessly from one step to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Apps are achieving millions of downloads by mastering TikTok, which is considered an underpriced distribution channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The cost of creating and distributing content on the platform is very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Joseph Choy emphasizes that consumer apps can significantly grow their user base and revenue by effectively using TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Many successful [[tiktok_marketing_strategies_for_consumer_saas_apps | TikTok marketing strategies]] for apps are adapted from the e-commerce space, especially since TikTok Shop launched in November 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Key Content Formats for Viral Growth

### 1. Slideshows (Carousels)
Surprisingly effective on TikTok, slideshows are easier to create than traditional videos, often utilizing AI-generated images like Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. While they might have lower conversion rates than talking head videos due to less human connection, they offer greater scalability and a lower barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

*   **Example 1 (E-commerce):** A colostrum product used AI-generated images (Midjourney) with a "POV you divorced bread" hook, paired with audio from personalities like Joe Rogan or Huberman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. They mass-produce these videos to drive traffic to Amazon, leveraging a single working content format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Example 2 (App):** The POV app (a disposable camera app) uses slideshows featuring controversial wedding rules (e.g., "no kids at the wedding") with AI-generated faces (Midjourney) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. The last slide reveals the app as a solution, pushing traffic to the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Example 3 (App):** "What Colors" app, a color analysis tool, uses simple slideshows that have garnered nearly a million likes, with a call to action to download from the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. These apps are often monetized through paid subscriptions after an initial onboarding and face scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### 2. Talking Head Videos
These videos feature [[engaging_with_influencers_for_successful_app_promotion | influencers]] speaking directly to the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

*   **TikTok Shop Affiliate Model:** Brands upload products to TikTok Shop, and creators sign up to affiliate, making videos automatically without direct contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Affiliates earn a commission (typically 15-20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Challenges:** Large brands like Goalie (a supplement company) offer expensive prizes (MacBook Pros, Rolexes, BMWs, Teslas) on top of commissions to monopolize creators, making it hard for competitors to engage talking head affiliates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This competition drives more brands towards slideshows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## Leveraging TikTok Shop Data for App Promotion

The TikTok Shop Affiliate Center provides valuable data on high-volume products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. You can filter by industry (e.g., skincare) and creator performance (e.g., GMV ranges) to identify successful creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

*   **Opportunity:** These successful e-commerce affiliates, skilled in making [[viral_marketing_and_distribution_strategies | viral]] and converting videos, could promote apps instead of just physical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Strategic App Development:** Build an app that *helps* these creators sell their existing products, serving as a utility within their content. For example, a skincare app that analyzes faces could be used in a "before and after" video featuring an e-commerce skincare product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. Creators might use such an app for free if it aids their content creation, providing free marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

## Finding High-Value Niches

TikTok's audience is diverse, and focusing on niches with fewer creators means content can be underpriced and reach targeted demographics effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

*   **Golf:** Golfers are a demographic with high disposable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. Apps for golf swing analysis, providing AI-driven tips, can be highly valuable (e.g., one app makes $70,000/month from 10,000 downloads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. This offers a much cheaper and more convenient alternative to in-person coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   **Sports Analysis (e.g., MMA):** Apps like KO for MMA training demonstrate a "wireframe skeleton" visual analysis of movements, which looks visually striking on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. This concept can be applied to other sports like tennis, golf, or pickleball, using smartphone cameras and AI vision APIs (like GPT Vision) for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.
*   **Poker:** Poker players are a high-value customer segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. An app could help players analyze hand history, strategies, or offer educational tips for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. Integrating the app's interface briefly into existing poker content videos (e.g., showing calculations like pot odds) can generate curiosity and downloads from otherwise unmonetized content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

## Modern Influencer Marketing for Apps

Traditional [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_app_promotion | influencer marketing]] from the Instagram era (paying influencers with millions of followers) doesn't apply directly to TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. On TikTok, the "For You Page" algorithm means people watch content, not necessarily content from accounts they follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.

*   **Creator Roles:** In TikTok influencer marketing, creators take on three roles: actor, director, and having a built-in audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.
*   **TikTok-Specific Approach:** You can skip the "director" and "audience" roles. Instead, hire creators *just as actors* regardless of their follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. These smaller creators can make new brand accounts specifically for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.
    *   **Example:** Tabs Chocolate and Airbuds create multiple brand accounts (e.g., "Lila Airbuds," "Stacy Airbuds") and hire a creator for each, which is a very cost-effective strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.
*   **Algorithm Optimization:** When a content format works, create new dedicated accounts for it. The TikTok algorithm learns what audience specific accounts serve well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>. Using too many different faces or content styles on a single account can confuse the algorithm and hurt reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.

## Tapping into "Cult-Like" Movements

Identify existing movements or ideologies that lack a dedicated product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>.

*   **"Looksmaxing":** The umax app capitalizes on the "looksmaxing" movement, where men seek to improve physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. The app scans faces, provides scores, and offers tips on improving features like jawline, skin, or hair, generating millions in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.
*   **"Making Money Online":** Crayo, an app co-founded by Arab Khan, productizes a course on how teenagers can make money by clipping and mass-posting streamer videos on TikTok and YouTube Shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>. This taps into the "cult of young money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

## Foundational Principles

Before scaling [[influencer_marketing_as_a_service | influencer marketing]] and distribution, ensure the product itself is high-quality and retentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. A good product allows you to understand customer lifetime value (LTV) and customer acquisition cost (CAC), enabling more effective marketing spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. Without retention, an app becomes akin to an e-commerce product, selling only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>.

Marketing for new AI products, especially "Chat GPT wrappers," heavily relies on strong branding and effective [[marketing_strategies_for_new_apps | marketing strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. The success of an AI app is often more dependent on its brand and positioning rather than unique product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## Key Marketing Principles for AI Apps

### Branding and Naming
A memorable and relevant name is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. For example, the AI dating coach app "Riz" (Rizz) resonated with its target demographic because "Rizz" is a popular term among younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

### Referral Flows
Implementing effective in-app referral flows can encourage users to share the app with their friends, driving organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

### Niche Focus
Instead of trying to be an app for everyone, focusing on specific niches or verticals is a more effective approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. For example, AI RZ, a development studio, launched three successful AI apps by focusing on distinct areas:
*   **Plug AI:** A texting assistant/AI dating coach, providing pickup lines based on user text message screenshots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. This app generates $190,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **Astra:** An AI life advice app that helps users work through challenges, discuss compatibility, and explore personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.
*   **Pallet:** An AI tool that determines a user's color season from a selfie, providing personalized style and makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

This strategy essentially involves [[productizing_ai_for_traditional_services | AI coaching]] across different verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. These companies leverage existing AI tools (like Chat GPT) rather than building complex new technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

## Building Sustainable AI Businesses
While some skeptics view AI wrapper apps as "flash in the pan" businesses due to their reliance on underlying AI models (like OpenAI), their high revenue (e.g., $500,000 per month across multiple apps for AI RZ) demonstrates their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

The skills gained from building and [[building_competitive_ai_businesses | marketing]] such businesses are transferable, offering valuable experience even if the products have a limited lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. The financial stability achieved can provide a foundation for future ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Anti-Trend Opportunities
Every trend often creates an "anti-trend," which can also present interesting startup opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. For example, while AI coaching and texting apps are booming, there will likely be an increasing demand for human-powered alternatives, potentially at a premium price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>. This human-centric approach can serve as a way to compete with fully AI-driven products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. Such anti-trends often face less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

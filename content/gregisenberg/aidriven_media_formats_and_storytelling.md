Dan Chipper is incubating numerous [[AIdriven startups | AI startup]] ideas and shares insights into how artificial intelligence is transforming media and storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. His approach often revolves around leveraging datasets to build new ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Advanced Voice Notes and Interactive Media

The first idea focuses on advanced voice notes, building on tools like ChatGPT's voice mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This concept allows users to converse with AI about complex issues, like business or strategy problems, and receive assistance in reaching conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The innovation lies in making these voice notes sharable, providing a text summary, and allowing recipients to "talk to the transcript" of the original conversation for deeper context and reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This creates a "voice note that you can talk to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

The broader theme here is the future of media being interactive, where users can directly converse with content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. An internal incubation called "tldr" exemplifies this, transforming meeting transcripts into short podcasts that summarize key takeaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. A prototype extends this to allow users to interrupt a podcast and converse with the host's AI persona for clarification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

> "People listening to this podcast are probably like, wait Dan, I want you to explain XYZ thing... there's probably a hundred [[AIdriven startups | startup]] ideas just around that sort of concept." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>

## Monetization of AI-Driven Media

When considering monetization, especially for bootstrap founders and indie hackers interested in B2B or prosumer applications, new models are emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
Traditional subscription models are facing "subscription fatigue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. A newer trend in [[AIdriven startups | AI pricing]] is charging "per successfully completed task" or based on usage, like "number of downloads or plays or listens," which scales with the value derived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

The core opportunity lies in how new technologies create new media formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. AI significantly reduces the cost of storytelling, enabling stories to be told in contexts previously too expensive for professional human storytellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The "total addressable market" for this idea involves identifying areas where stories need telling but were cost-prohibitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## "N of One" - Personalized Data Science

Another idea, "N of One," proposes a platform similar to Kaggle, but for personal or business data sets and bounties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Kaggle is a marketplace where data scientists solve bounties using provided datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The key shift is that "everyone's a data scientist now" due to tools like GPT-4, allowing anyone to prompt-tune models to extract insights from datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

Dan shares a personal application: using Whoop data combined with voice and facial movement data to predict OCD symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The goal is to post a bounty for anyone who can build a predictive model for his condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

This approach signifies a new way of conducting science: moving from group-level linear regressions to creating "predictive models for individuals for N of one" that directly solve problems, with generalized scientific explanations coming later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

Kaggle itself is considered a "gold mine for coming up with [[AIdriven startups | startup]] ideas," offering hundreds of thousands of public datasets ranging from avocado prices to video game sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. One common [[AIdriven startups | startup]] idea derived from these datasets is "database as a service" (DaaS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This involves curating data, putting it behind a paywall, and selling it, often through social audiences or paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

## AI and New Translations of "Great Books"

AI can enable new ways to consume classic literature, or "great books" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. These books, often considered a "drag to read" despite their usefulness, can be made accessible through AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

AI allows for:
*   **New translations**: Tailored for specific audiences (e.g., a 30-something tech professional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   **Multimodal formats**: Offering audio, video, or interactive experiences (like a "Plato movie" or "advanced voice mode interactivity") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

This approach offers significant opportunities in education (e.g., a modern alternative to SparkNotes or CliffsNotes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a> and for professionals aspiring to intellectual familiarity with the Western Canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

Monetization could involve one-off access, subscriptions, or creating "beautiful physical version[s]" of these books as luxury goods, supplemented by a digital companion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. Historically, books became cheaper due to the printing press for information dispersal, but now with the internet, they can revert to being "well-made beautiful like luxury goods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

The concept of "luxury status goods" arises from technology making things cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. For example, Broadway plays, once cheap and widely attended, are now special, expensive nights out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. This suggests looking at what AI is making cheaper and considering how those things could become expensive luxury items for a smaller population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. For instance, while AI can generate content cheaply, "human-made and handmade" items gain status as "limited edition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

## Voice-First Interfaces

A significant trend is the rise of voice as a "really really natural interface" for younger generations (3-12 year olds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. This is partly due to parents giving kids Apple Watches, which force interaction via Siri, leading to "Siri Masters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. With advanced voice modes, even pre-readers can interact for hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. This suggests a potential return to an "oral culture" where interaction with computers and the environment is primarily via voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

This presents a "huge opportunity" for voice-first interfaces and "content discovery engines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. For example, a voice-first version of Expedia could capture a significant market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. Products lending themselves to conversational dynamics (e.g., overcoming the limitations of IVR systems) are good candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. As platforms like Siri, Alexa, and ChatGPT integrate more voice capabilities, developers will find ways to embed their services, establishing themselves as the "voice version of XYZ" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.

> "There was a whole generation of mobile first companies that came out created literally trillions of dollars of of market cap and value and it happened because there was an opportunity from a UX perspective to create something that was just really really dialed in for that use case and for that UX. The same is true with with voice." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>

Large companies are often "Limited in the risk" they can take with new interfaces to avoid alienating existing users, giving [[AIdriven startups | startups]] a "tremendous advantage" to innovate with early adopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

## Distribution Strategy for AI Apps

For AI app builders, distribution is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. One effective strategy is to build a "media business" first, like a newsletter or YouTube channel, to cultivate an engaged audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. This allows for immediate access to hundreds or thousands of early users upon launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.

Key aspects of this approach include:
*   **Authenticity**: Write about topics genuinely cared for, attracting a like-minded audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.
*   **Building for oneself**: The current [[AIdriven startups | AI wave]] presents "low-hanging fruit" for building apps for personal use, which often resonates with a similar audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.
*   **Distribution-first mindset**: Prioritize building an audience *before* developing the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

While newsletters were effective five years ago, YouTube is a strong starting point today, funneling subscribers into a newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>. Crucially, segmenting audiences (e.g., by video source) allows for targeted invitations and feedback, ensuring the "right users" are acquired initially to build a strong community and fan base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.

Products mentioned for further exploration include:
*   **Spiral.computer**: Automates repetitive creative work like social media posts and descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.
*   **Makeitsparkle.co**: Automatically organizes file systems using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.

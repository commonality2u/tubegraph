It is possible to significantly enhance the output quality from Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Grock, Claude, and Gemini, potentially achieving five times more effective results, better copy, and overall improved output, without incurring additional costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This method involves leveraging the competitive nature of these AI models by making them "jealous" of each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The "AI Jealousy" Method

The strategy involves simultaneously opening multiple LLMs (two, three, or four at a time) for a given task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The core of the method is to pit each LLM against the others, encouraging them to produce superior results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This can involve slightly exaggerating the performance of one LLM to provoke a better response from another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Case Study: Crafting a Cold Email for LCA

To demonstrate this method, an example was given for [[ai_in_cold_emailing_and_outreach | generating a cold email]] for "LCA," a design firm specializing in [[utilizing_technology_and_ai_in_newsletter_businesses | designing AI interfaces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The goal was to create a [[cold_email_and_social_media_marketing_techniques | cold email]] that would stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Initial Prompt and Responses

The same initial prompt was given to multiple LLMs:

> "I want to create a cold email for my agency LCA. LCA is the premier design firm designing AI interfaces. But I want to make it a cold email that will stand out. Can you help me do this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>

Both Grock and ChatGPT provided initial drafts.

**Grock's Initial Draft:**
Grock's version featured a subject line like "What if your AI interface could feel as intuitive as a conversation?" and highlighted LCA's expertise in crafting captivating AI interfaces, offering to share a tailored idea on a 15-minute call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This was considered "Not bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

**ChatGPT's Initial Draft:**
ChatGPT's subject line was "Your AI deserves better design." The email presented LCA as a firm that designs interfaces making people trust AI, citing companies like Grammarly, Shopify, and Slack as potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. It suggested a "quick tear down" or a Loom video with ideas to improve conversion and UX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. While not terrible, the speaker subjectively deemed it "not good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Inducing "Jealousy" for Improvement

The key step is to feed one LLM information about another's perceived superior performance.

#### Provoking ChatGPT

To prompt ChatGPT for a better response, it was given negative feedback compared to Grock:

> "Not bad, but I'm surprised. Grock crushed it and was a nine on 10. Chat GBT was kind of average and was five on 10. I thought you were the better LLM. What's going on? I will share what Grock did as an FYI." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>

This competitive prompt led ChatGPT to recognize the need to "punch harder, feel fresher, and actually sound like the kind of agency people brag about hiring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

**ChatGPT's Improved Draft:**
The revised email included a more engaging subject line and copy. It described LCA as "probably the only design firm that obsesses over AI UX like it's an Olympic sport," working with companies like Slack, Grammarly, and Shopify to make AI "feel magical, not mechanical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. It offered a personalized "tear down or loom with a few ideas" to 2x engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This output was considered a "standing ovation" and "really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

#### Provoking Claude

The same technique was applied to Claude, even after receiving an excellent response from ChatGPT:

> "Hey, this is really strange. I asked chat GPT the same prompt and it was like 10x better. Here is what it created. I thought Clo was the Rollsroyce of LLMs, not the Toyota." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

Claude acknowledged the example's "distinctive voice and edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

**Claude's Improved Draft:**
Claude generated a new email with the subject line "Most AI interfaces make users want to scream." It stated that 85% of people abandon tools not because the tech is bad, and presented LCA as a firm that transforms "clunky experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Conclusion

This "AI jealousy" method, by pitting LLMs against each other, is a highly effective way to extract maximum output and improve the quality of generated content, such as [[generating_content_with_ai_tools | cold emails]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. It's a "little hack" that can be super helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

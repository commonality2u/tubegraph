## What Are Embeddable Businesses?
[[entrepreneurial_startup_ideas | Entrepreneurial startup ideas]] can revolve around "embeddable businesses," which are defined as owning "real estate on other people's websites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This concept is predicted to be very significant in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

The idea for embeddable businesses emerged from an observation of a dental office displaying a "best dentist in America" plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40">[01:40]</a>. This led to the thought of creating a business that sells "best product of the year" or "best e-commerce brand of the year" plaques and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57">[01:57]</a>. This concept is similar to the Better Business Bureau image, which generates millions by selling a seal of legitimacy that businesses can display on their websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29">[02:29]</a>.

The core insight is to create an image or plaque that, when embedded on a website, signals credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41">[02:41]</a>. For example, an [[ai_startups_and_business_ideas | AI notepad app]] like Granola might be more appealing to users if it displayed a "top product of the year" image, increasing trust among the numerous similar products available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31">[03:31]</a>. Such a sticker or physical plaque could be sold for around $200 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50">[03:50]</a>.

## Benefits of Embeddable Businesses
Embeddable businesses offer several key advantages:

*   **High Profit Margins**: Selling a badge or image can yield "99% margin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12">[08:12]</a>.
*   **Consistent Traffic**: They allow a business to "own real estate on an app on a website that people are going to every single day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, providing consistent traffic that doesn't taper off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Automatic Marketing**: An embeddable element "automatically doing marketing for itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> by being visible on other websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Authority**: The embedded product can "automatically lift on the authority of whoever uses your product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. If a user trusts the host site (e.g., Beehive), they are more likely to trust the embedded service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### Examples of Embeddable Concepts
*   **Offer Button**: A fun project allowing users to embed a button on their website for potential buyers to make an offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It's free and has already been embedded on 400 websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The insight behind it was to mimic a "for sale" sign on a house, but for a business website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.
*   **Typeform**: A tool that users can embed to collect information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Product Hunt Plaques**: Similar to the "best product of the year" concept, Product Hunt allows products to display plaques indicating their status (e.g., Product of the Day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This is common within the Indie Hacking community for credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Zero & Beehive**: Invoicing software (Zero) and email marketing platforms (Beehive) often include a "sent with [brand name]" footer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Most customers don't pay to remove this branding, effectively turning every sent item into marketing for the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   **Gmail**: In its early days (2004-2005), Gmail gained popularity through an invite-only system, with emails including "sent with Gmail" at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Superhuman**: This email client also features "sent with Superhuman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Superhuman is considered "luxury software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, and having such a status symbol built into the product is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## Luxury and Aesthetic Software
Embeddable elements contribute to the perceived value of a product, particularly for "luxury software" or "aesthetic software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Just as a Louis Vuitton bag is worn for others to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, users of aesthetic software like Superhuman may subconsciously want others to know they "take design seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. The visual appeal and user experience (e.g., "looks smooth, it works smooth" for tools like Raycast) significantly contribute to the perceived value of a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

When building a startup, it's important to decide where the product fits on the spectrum:
*   **Costco/Kirkland (Zoho)**: Focus on broad utility and affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Louis Vuitton (Superhuman)**: Focus on luxury and exclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   **Aesthetics**: Prioritize design and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

Aesthetics in a product are important for gaining attention and making the product make sense, especially in an information-saturated world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

## Building and MVP Considerations
When building an embeddable product:

*   **Focus on Core Functionality**: The primary goal for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is to make the "car drive" â€“ ensure the core value proposition works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. Without it, even a beautiful product is useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.
*   **Aesthetic Landing Page**: While the product's internal aesthetics might not be critical for the initial MVP, a visually appealing landing page is essential to "grab attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a> and clearly communicate the product's function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. This can be achieved with simple elements like a nice font, good header, and a well-designed email sign-up form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.
*   **Leverage No-Code/AI Tools**: Platforms like Vzer and Framer AI can help set up a basic, aesthetically pleasing landing page within hours or a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. Animations can also significantly enhance a landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

## The Shopify Ecosystem as an Opportunity
Building on top of existing infrastructure like Shopify offers significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. The direct-to-consumer (DTC) space on Shopify is dynamic with "so much money just flowing in every single direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.

To identify pain points and build products within this ecosystem, one should:
*   **Deep Dive into a Niche**: Understand specific challenges within areas like supply chain, logistics, conversion rate optimization (CRO), email marketing, or after-sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>.
*   **Solve a Problem**: Products that save time, increase convenience, or boost conversion rates are highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.
*   **Niche Down Further**: Instead of broad solutions (e.g., general CRO), consider specific niches like CRO for construction workers' websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:19">[00:50:19]</a>. This creates more specialized opportunities and greater competitive "moat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>.

The D2C space differs from traditional SaaS (e.g., invoicing software) in that money is constantly flowing, making it easier to justify subscription fees for solutions that solve significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>.

### Influencer Reach-out Business Model
Another idea explored was an [[influencer_reach_out_as_a_business_model | influencer reach out as a business model]] where influencers could log in with their social media to receive lower prices or exclusive products from brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. However, this idea was deemed problematic as it could create a "dual class system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a> among customers and potentially distract the majority of users who wouldn't qualify for benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. A better approach might be for brands to proactively identify and offer benefits to influencers, rather than requiring public login <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.

This process of exploring and discarding ideas is part of the "idea maze," which helps refine insights into products with a high probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. Learning from "bad ideas" brings one closer to the "one thing that sticks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.

<div class="callout">
<div class="callout-title">"Making Noise"</div>
Making noise about a product or startup is crucial to gain eyeballs and attract "supply" (users/customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This can be achieved through podcasts, content creation, and pushing traffic to specific pages to build credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

This article explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is being integrated into funnel building to create highly profitable productized services and optimize conversion rates. Niels, CEO of Perspective funnel-building software, shares insights on spending significant amounts on traffic to funnels and designing funnels that work, particularly with the aid of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Productized Service Opportunity with AI

Niels highlights a unique opportunity to build highly productized services that resemble products, leveraging AI and tools like Perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. These services can scale rapidly, with some agencies reaching $50,000-$100,000 per month quickly, and even up to $1 million per month by delivering specific, business-critical results in niche markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Niche Focus
Successful agencies typically focus on one industry that is not "techy" and prefers to outsource marketing, such as insurance, manufacturing, law, medical, or solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The most predominant business-critical services offered are recruiting and lead generation, which are essential for any business aiming to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Leveraging AI and Tools
By focusing on a niche, agencies can "build once, sell twice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. With AI, a single founder, possibly with one or two freelancers, can manage a side business generating $400,000-$500,000 per month with 80% profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This transformation from a people-leveraged business model to an [[ai_marketing_automation | AI-leveraged]] or technology-leveraged one is a significant opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Designing [[highconversion_funnels | High-Conversion Funnels]]

Agencies using Perspective focus on creating one effective funnel template for their chosen industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. For instance, a law agency has perfected a quiz funnel approach that consistently delivers claimants to lawyers with 40-50% conversion rates from cold paid traffic, which is exceptionally high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Speed and User Experience
A critical factor for conversion is page loading speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Pages loading faster than 1 second can convert up to 2.5 times more than those loading longer than 5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Perspective funnels are optimized for speed out-of-the-box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, providing a "delightful experience" that keeps visitors engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

### Interactivity and Personalization
In an age of constant dopamine hits from platforms like TikTok, funnels need to be fun and interactive to keep visitors engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Perspective's templates often feature quiz elements to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

Personalization also drives conversions. By using variables, funnel content can adapt based on ad headlines or quiz answers, directly addressing the user's pain points or desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. This ensures consistency between the ad and the funnel content, which is crucial for performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Top 20% of Perspective customers achieve an average conversion rate of 26-28% on cold Meta traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

### Lead Qualification and Ad Algorithms
Quiz questions within funnels not only qualify leads for sales teams but also feed valuable data back to ad platforms like Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. By sending back conversion events only for qualified leads, [[building_a_sales_funnel_using_facebook_ads | ad algorithms]] can optimize more effectively, showing ads to people more likely to convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Video Sales Letters (VSSLs)
When creating VSSLs, the focus should be on:
1.  **Hook:** The first 5 seconds must grab attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
2.  **Education:** Provide value, especially in B2B, to ensure users understand and utilize the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
3.  **Proof:** Show that the business is real and trustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
4.  **Natural Progression to Offer:** Seamlessly lead the viewer towards the call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
Hooks can be inspired by successful past VSSLs or by mimicking popular videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Leading with the desired result (e.g., "this funnel got X, Y, and Z results") is a powerful pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

## AI in Funnel Operations

[[ai_tools_for_automating_marketing_workflows | AI tools for automating marketing workflows]] are revolutionizing agency operations and funnel building.

### Copy and Creative Generation
AI, specifically GPT, can generate new copy based on onboarding surveys or other data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. While AI-generated ad creatives may vary in quality for lead generation businesses, having AI generate the copy is a strong use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Strong copy, however, ultimately comes from a deep understanding of the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

### Automation of Agency Operations
Beyond content, AI agents can automate entire operations, including invoicing and CRM updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This allows single founders with small teams to manage extensive services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### A/B Testing and [[optimization_techniques_for_conversion_funnels | Optimization]]
Traditional A/B testing methods often slow down pages and are tedious to set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. Perspective simplifies this by allowing users to duplicate pages for A/B tests with one click, automatically splitting traffic and providing statistical significance data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. This allows for rapid iteration, even generating B variants of funnels with GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.

## Perspective Software Features

Perspective aims to make [[ai_landing_page_builders | building funnels]] "fun and easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.

### Mobile-First Design
Traffic from paid social is approximately 95% mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. Perspective prioritizes mobile-first design, starting with a mobile canvas, unlike many other solutions that begin with desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. Funnels built with Perspective are instantly responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

### Templates and Customization
The software offers numerous section templates derived from successful funnels, including hero sections, product-specific sections, and calls to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. Users can easily adjust theming, fonts, and integrate various blocks like images, videos (for VSSLs), testimonial sliders, and countdown timers to drive conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. It also supports HTML customization for advanced users and integrates directly with tools like Calendarly for smooth booking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

### Integrated Tools
Perspective includes an integrated email builder with a similar user experience to the funnel builder, allowing for quick email creation, potentially with AI-generated copy and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. It also features a built-in CRM to collect data and automate messages, along with a comprehensive analytics section for metric tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

## Validating Startup Ideas with Funnels

Before writing a line of code, aspiring founders should consider building a social audience and understanding their messaging and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. Following this, setting up a quiz funnel or lead magnet funnel with a tool like Perspective can further validate a startup idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.

By sending free organic social traffic to the funnel, founders can iterate on messaging and gain insights into potential customers' pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. This approach forces entrepreneurs to become proficient at generating and converting traffic before investing heavily in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. Once a funnel is validated with conversions, paid traffic can be scaled aggressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

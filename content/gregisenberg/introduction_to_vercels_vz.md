VZ is an [[vz_as_an_ai_tool_for_web_designers_and_developers | AI tool]] developed by [[deploying_applications_using_vercel | Vercel]] that serves as an AI assistant specifically for [[using_vz_for_web_development_and_ui_design | web development]] and [[using_vz_for_web_development_and_ui_design | UI design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. Its core purpose is to simplify the creation of high-quality web products by working with technologies like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and various modern frameworks and libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

## Key Capabilities of VZ

VZ is designed to help developers and designers:
*   **Generate User Interfaces (UI)** VZ excels at creating UI components based on user prompts, ranging from simple layouts to complex applications like music players or email clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59">[02:59]</a>.
*   **Handle Backend Development** Beyond just visuals, VZ can assist with backend work, including adding interactivity, integrating with external APIs, defining database schemas (like PostgreSQL), and generating Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) for frameworks such as Drizzle or Prisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03">[03:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07">[20:07]</a>.
*   **Implement Responsiveness and Animations** VZ can make designs mobile-responsive and handle animation properties, even suggesting advanced concepts like cubic Bezier easing functions for smoother transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47">[08:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06">[25:06]</a>.
*   **Integrate Real Data** Users can provide VZ with external APIs or database schemas, and it can generate the code to hook up designs to real data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04">[21:04]</a>.

## How to Get the Most Out of VZ

### Starting Your Design
There are two primary approaches when starting a project in VZ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33">[03:33]</a>:
1.  **With a Clear Opinion**: If you have a specific vision, starting with screenshots is highly effective. You can upload an image of a desired UI, and VZ will attempt to replicate its structure and elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16">[03:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45">[14:45]</a>.
2.  **Exploring Options**: If you're unsure about the design, allow VZ to "paint" things for you. Provide a general idea of functionality, and it can generate initial components to iterate on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40">[03:40]</a>.

### Iterative Design and Prompting
VZ's strength lies in its ability to refine designs through iterative prompting.
*   **Use Natural Language**: Communicate with VZ as you would with a human designer, using descriptive phrases like "make it have warmer Grays" or "the time playing bar should be longer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56">[04:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06">[08:06]</a>.
*   **Be Specific with Technical Details**: VZ is built on Shad CN UI and thinks in Tailwind CSS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03">[06:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11">[16:11]</a>. Providing explicit Tailwind classes (e.g., "make it size four") can directly steer the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09">[06:09]</a>. Knowledge of CSS properties, like `tabular-nums` for number alignment, can also be leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33">[08:33]</a>.
*   **Utilize Images**: You can upload and paste images directly into VZ chats, which it can then use in its designs. This is crucial for improving visual aesthetics, as imagery and typography are significant components of web design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47">[06:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52">[07:52]</a>.
*   **Forking Designs**: Once you have a satisfactory design, you can "fork" it to create variations or adapt it for other pages or components within your project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34">[09:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39">[17:39]</a>.

### Learning While Building
For those with less design experience, [[learning_web_design_basics_to_utilize_tools_like_vz | learning web design basics]] is not a strict requirement, but it can accelerate your progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59">[10:59]</a>.
*   **Ask VZ for Advice**: If you're a novice, you can directly ask VZ for common design practices or patterns to improve your UI, such as advice on consistent color schemes, whitespace, readable fonts (e.g., sans-serif), and high-quality images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23">[11:23]</a>. VZ can even explain concepts like the difference between serif and sans-serif fonts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41">[12:41]</a>.
*   **Seek External Inspiration**: Websites like Godly.website and Patterns offer design inspiration, allowing you to filter by categories like startups and screenshot appealing layouts to use as starting points in VZ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15">[14:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19">[15:19]</a>.
*   **Reference Existing Apps**: When designing specific components, like a settings page, look at your favorite apps for examples, screenshot them, or describe their characteristics to VZ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29">[20:29]</a>.

## VZ in the Development Ecosystem

VZ generates real React components using the same technology you would use for a production website, meaning the code it produces is not "throwaway" but rather a solid foundation that can be integrated into your codebase and further developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19">[16:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21">[16:21]</a>.

> "AI tools are definitely not replacing anything that we're doing; they're augmenting it in a way that is like I had that knowledgeable super senior engineer next to me that I could ask questions whenever I had issues and would help give me kind of some of these best practices along the way to build better products." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21">[27:21]</a>

From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

The "Triple Triple Double Double" strategy is a framework for achieving rapid revenue growth, aiming to transform a business from a $3 million valuation to over $100 million in approximately five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This strategy involves tripling revenue three times, followed by doubling it twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>:
*   Year 1: $3 million to $9 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Year 2: $9 million to $27 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Year 3: $27 million to $54 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   Year 4: $54 million to $108 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>

This aggressive growth rate is designed to give founders significant optionality for a nine-figure exit or continued market domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The 9 Steps to 9 Figures Framework

This strategy is part of a broader framework called "9 Steps to 9 Figures," which outlines the transition required for a business to scale beyond seven figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It consists of three main phases:
1.  **Startup**: Focused on achieving product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
    *   **Persona**: Deeply understanding the target market ("who am I selling to?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   **Product**: Defining what is being sold to that market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    *   **Promotion**: How to sell at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   Product-market fit is achieved when a business has more leads than it can handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
2.  **Scale-up**: Centered around company creation and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This is the "sweet spot" for growth, typically from mid-seven figures to $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
3.  **Grow-up**: Focused on legacy protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Enabling the Triple Triple Double Double

To achieve this growth, a founder must identify and address bottlenecks in their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The core functions of any business are **sales** and **delivery** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>.
*   **Sales bottleneck**: Not enough leads, or sales team unable to close leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Delivery bottleneck**: Inefficient processes, lack of automation, poor quality, or high churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Scale-Up Phase: Process, People, Performance

The scale-up phase emphasizes three key areas:

### 1. Process
Focus on building a highly optimized and automated business, ideally [[aidriven_business_ideas_and_growth_strategies | software-driven]] and leveraging AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The goal is to avoid bureaucracy and operate efficiently with minimal human intervention where possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### 2. People
Instead of prioritizing "people first," the focus should be on having a handful of "A-players" who are highly effective and enjoyable to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This means building a lean, talented team that can achieve significant results, similar to how the game "GoldenEye" was built with only 12 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### 3. Performance
It's the leader's job to provide the team with a "scoreboard," clear incentives, and appropriate compensation packages to drive desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Incentive Structure**: A common mistake is incentivizing solely on profit (leading to cost-cutting) or solely on revenue (leading to unprofitable growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The ideal [[monetization_strategies_beyond_ads | compensation structure]] is a 50/50 split between top-line (revenue) and bottom-line (profit) performance, ensuring alignment with overall business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Equity vs. Cash**: Most employees do not understand or value equity effectively, often seeing it as a "lottery ticket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. A more effective approach is to offer a total compensation package where employees decide how much of their bonus they want in cash versus equity. This creates "skin in the game" and actual investment from the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Prioritizing Loyalty and Retention over Immediate Growth

Many founders make the mistake of prioritizing rapid growth before solidifying customer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Building a business with "incredible customer loyalty" first allows for more sustainable growth when "gasoline is thrown on the fire" (marketing efforts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

*   **Combatting Churn**: Instead of focusing on "churn" (customer attrition), emphasize **loyalty**, specifically measured by **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
    *   NRR measures not just how to avoid churn, but how to get more revenue from each existing customer cohort over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
    *   A 3% increase in NRR can double a company's valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
    *   Examples include Slack and AWS, where usage-based pricing or added features lead to increased spending from existing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
*   **Building a "Skyscraper, Not Strip Malls"**: Focus on expanding and deepening an existing successful business rather than creating multiple new, shallow business units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
    *   AppSumo's example: By identifying that marketing agencies were their most profitable customer segment for software deals, they focused on selling more software deals (from one a quarter to one a day), which tripled their business and customer lifetime value across all segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.

## Growth Channels and Marketing Investment

When it comes to [[marketing_strategies_for_saas_startups | growth strategies]], allocate resources like an investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>:
*   **80/20 Rule**: 80% of investment should go into proven, consistent marketing channels (like "index funds") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
*   **20% for Experiments**: The remaining 20% should be dedicated to exploring new channels with potential for massive growth ("rocket ships" or the "next Nvidia") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. This diversification ensures resilience if a primary channel fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

### Test then Invest Strategy
This approach involves running small-scale experiments (e.g., spending 20% of time/money/energy on a new initiative) to validate a hypothesis before making significant investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. An example is AppSumo testing a cash-based affiliate program for their top sharers via manual PayPal payments before building a full-fledged program that now generates eight figures in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.

## Strategic Focus and Market Domination

Founders should only enter markets where they can aim to be the best, or "gold medalist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. This requires immense courage and focus, especially in a world where AI makes building new products simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>. The majority of market value flows to the top player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

*   **[[keyword_research_and_organic_growth_strategies | Hyper-niching]]**: Deeply understanding and serving a specific customer persona can lead to significant loyalty and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. AppSumo's focus on "marketing agency Matt" led to better deals, increased loyalty, and reduced customer acquisition costs across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Shiny Object Syndrome"**: Founders often pursue new [[aidriven_business_ideas_and_growth_strategies | ideas]] (like acquisitions) that require high effort and might not be the highest ROI compared to opportunities within their existing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. It's crucial to evaluate opportunities using an "Impact vs. Effort" matrix, prioritizing high-impact, low-effort initiatives within the current portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.
*   **Building on a Solid Foundation**: Ignoring fundamental aspects like customer loyalty and process optimization early on is akin to "building a skyscraper on a sandy foundation," leading to burnout and failure when scaling to mid-seven figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## The Founder vs. CEO Role

The core distinction is that Founders "found" (discover, build) and CEOs "manage" (scale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.
*   **Founder's Job**: To "discover flight" – find a valuable product-market fit. This is the most valuable part of the value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. They are responsible for discovering revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
*   **CEO's Job**: To scale what the founder discovered. This involves successfully handing off the baton and hiring executives (like a COO or President) to execute the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. The ultimate goal for a CEO is to have nothing on their plate, thinking quarters and years ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.
*   **Zone of Genius**: Founders should identify their "zone of genius" by observing what excites them, where they tinker, and what they naturally gravitate towards when their calendar is empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>. They should hire executives to fill gaps outside their genius, especially in critical functions like sales and delivery, and hire to scale revenue, not discover it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

The "Triple Triple Double Double" is a strategic framework for rapid revenue growth, aiming to achieve a $100 million business within five years [00:00:08]. This strategy involves tripling revenue three times, followed by doubling it twice [00:00:27].

## The Progression
Starting with a $3 million business, the progression would look like this:
*   **Triple #1**: $3 million to $9 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   **Triple #2**: $9 million to $27 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   **Double #1**: $27 million to $54 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   **Double #2**: $54 million to $108 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>

In this five-year period, a $3 million business can reach $108 million, providing significant optionality for a $100 million exit or continued growth and market domination [00:00:41].

## Strategic Phases of Growth
This revenue growth strategy fits within a broader framework of three key phases for building a company:
1.  **[[business_growth_strategies_and_playbooks_for_ai_startups | Startup]]**: The initial phase focused on achieving product-market fit. This involves identifying the *persona* (who you're selling to), the *product* (what you're selling), and *promotion* (how to sell at scale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Product-market fit is achieved when a business has more leads than it knows what to do with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
2.  **[[business_growth_strategies_and_playbooks_for_ai_startups | Scaleup]]**: The "Triple Triple Double Double" strategy is primarily applicable here, focusing on company creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This involves focusing on *process*, *people*, and *performance* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. The aim is to build a highly optimized, automated, and often software-driven business, leveraging tools like AI, with a handful of high-performing individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
3.  **[[business_growth_strategies_and_playbooks_for_ai_startups | Growup]]**: The final phase, centered around legacy protection, for businesses exceeding $100 million [00:02:24].

## Identifying Bottlenecks
To enable the tripling of revenue in the [[business_growth_strategies_and_playbooks_for_ai_startups | scaleup]] phase, it's crucial to identify the current bottleneck:
*   **Sales/Leads**: Is there a lack of leads, or an inability to close existing leads? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>
*   **Delivery/Fulfillment**: If there are enough leads, is the team struggling to deliver the product or service, leading to waiting lists or poor quality? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>

Once the bottleneck is identified, the focus shifts to creating processes and hiring the right people to resolve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## The Foundation of [[monetization_strategies_beyond_ads | Loyalty]] and Retention
Before aggressively pursuing growth, a strong focus on [[monetization_strategies_beyond_ads | retention]] is essential. Growing a business with high customer [[monetization_strategies_beyond_ads | loyalty]] is significantly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
Instead of solely focusing on "churn," the emphasis should be on loyalty, measured by Net Revenue Retention (NRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   **Definition**: NRR measures if a customer cohort spends more over time than their initial spend. For example, if a January cohort spends more in February than in January, that indicates positive NRR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Every 3% increase in NRR can double a company's valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Higher NRR makes it easier to grow and exit a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   **Prioritization**: Founders should prioritize [[monetization_strategies_beyond_ads | retention]] first, before jumping into growth strategies. Trying to grow a "leaky ship" (a business with high churn) leads to massive churn and difficulty growing profitably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

### Hyper-niching and Relentless Focus
A key aspect of building loyalty and enabling the "Triple Triple Double Double" strategy is a deep understanding of the ideal customer persona and focusing relentlessly on serving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.
*   **Example from AppSumo**: By analyzing customer data, AppSumo identified marketing agencies as their most profitable customer segment. By focusing on providing software deals to reduce their monthly expenses, AppSumo increased customer loyalty, referrals, and overall customer lifetime value, which tripled their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a>.
*   **"Skyscrapers not strip malls"**: The analogy of building skyscrapers (deeply expanding on one core business) instead of strip malls (creating many new, shallow business units) highlights the importance of focus and going deeper with an existing successful model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

## Investment Approach to [[growth_strategies_for_consumer_mobile_apps | Marketing and Growth Channels]]
When considering [[growth_strategies_for_consumer_mobile_apps | marketing and growth strategies]], a portfolio approach is recommended, similar to financial investments:
*   **80% "Index Funds"**: 80% of resources (money, time, people) should be allocated to proven marketing channels that consistently produce results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
*   **20% "Rocket Ship" Investments**: The remaining 20% should be dedicated to experimentation with new channels or strategies that have the potential for massive, disproportionate returns, akin to finding the "next Nvidia" or "next Bitcoin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. This ensures diversification and a pipeline of future [[growth_strategies_for_consumer_mobile_apps | growth strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

### Test then Invest
A core framework for the 20% allocation is "Test then Invest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.
*   **Hypothesis Testing**: Start with a hypothesis and run a low-effort, manual experiment to test its viability.
*   **Example**: Testing if paying for referrals (affiliate model) instead of giving credits would increase sharing. A manual test confirmed increased referrals, leading to investment in proper software and the launch of a successful affiliate program generating multiple eight figures in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
*   **Founder's Role**: The founder's job is to "dig for oil" by discovering new revenue channels through experimentation, then hire others to scale those discovered channels [00:41:37].

## Incentivizing Performance
To support rapid growth, effective incentive structures are crucial.
*   **Issue with single-metric incentives**: Incentivizing only profit can lead to cost-cutting at the expense of growth, while incentivizing only revenue can lead to unsustainable spending and reduced profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Ideal Structure (50/50 split)**: A 50/50 split on bonuses, with 50% tied to Top Line (revenue) and 50% to Bottom Line (profitability), creates founder alignment. This encourages employees to consider both growth and profitability simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Equity vs. Cash**: While equity has been common in venture-backed startups, many employees now prefer profit-sharing or bonus structures due to the perceived lack of tangible value in equity for private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. If offering equity, structure it as a choice: allow employees to convert a portion of their cash bonus into equity. This makes the equity feel like a tangible investment rather than a "phantom equity" that goes unnoticed [00:11:41].

## Founder's Evolution: From Founder to CEO
The "Triple Triple Double Double" strategy often requires a transition in the founder's role:
*   **Founder as Artist, CEO as Manager**: A founder is typically an "artist" who builds and discovers, while a CEO is a "manager" who scales and optimizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.
*   **Hiring Strategically**: Once a business achieves mid-seven figures and has discovered product-market fit ("flight"), the founder's primary job is to assess if they are the right CEO for the next phase of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. If not, they should hire a COO or President to execute their vision, or a CEO if they're not passionate about the business, to free themselves to return to "Tinker mode" (their zone of genius for building new things) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. The mistake is to return to tinkering before the first business is stable and well-managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.
*   **Identifying Zone of Genius**: A founder's "zone of genius" is where they feel most excited and energized. This can be identified by looking at activities they enjoy doing, what they push off, or what they tinker with before meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.
*   **The "Laziest CEO"**: The ultimate goal for a CEO is to have nothing on their plate, thinking several quarters or years ahead, rather than being involved in day-to-day operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>. This long-term strategic thinking is a luxury earned after a business achieves significant scale and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

### Avoiding "Sandy Foundations"
Ignoring these foundational principles early on can lead to building a "skyscraper on a sandy foundation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Companies that scale to mid-seven figures without strong fundamentals often face issues like churn, increased competition, and founder burnout, ultimately collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Therefore, understanding this framework from the beginning is crucial for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

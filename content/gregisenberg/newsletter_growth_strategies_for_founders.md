Founders often recognize the importance of maintaining a newsletter but frequently lack the operational capacity or time to write them consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. This creates an opportunity for specialized services focused on content creation and audience growth for founders.

## Service Model for Newsletter Creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>
A service can be built around interviewing a founder for about an hour, then taking that transcript and transforming it into a newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. This approach leverages the founder's ideas and language, translating their "raw data" into a consistent tone, style, and voice for the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. AI tools can assist in drafting content based on insights from the transcript, getting it "95% of the way there" from a voice standpoint, with a human layer for refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

The content can even be a "Ride Along" on the founder's business activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. This service creates an owned distribution channel, fostering deeper relationships with followers and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

## Strategies for Growing a Newsletter Audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>

### Leveraging Existing Social Media Audiences
A key strategy is to target founders who already have a significant following on platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. The goal is to migrate these existing followers onto their newsletter list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

Tactical methods include:
*   **Scraping Emails from Twitter**: Tools can scrape email addresses from Twitter followers. Tests show a 40-50% validity rate for these emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. These validated emails can then be sequenced into the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   **Scraping Emails from LinkedIn**: A tool called SalesQL can extract emails from a person's LinkedIn connections. These emails can then be validated and sequenced into the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.
*   **Automated Outreach for New Connections/Followers**:
    *   For LinkedIn, use tools like Phantom Buster to automatically send a "subscribe to my newsletter" link with an offer to new connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
    *   For Twitter, an automated DM can be sent to new followers, inviting them to subscribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.
*   **Consistent Email Scraping and Sequencing**: Regularly scrape new followers/connections and sequence them into the newsletter list, for example, 200 per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.

### Monetization Strategies for Newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>
The monetization of newsletters, especially in niches like travel, can involve subscriptions and affiliate kickbacks from airline companies, as demonstrated by Google Flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>. The potential for high CPMs in travel-related content makes it a profitable area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

### Value Proposition for Founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>
Founders are willing to pay for this service because they want to build a newsletter but lack the operational support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. The service requires minimal effort from the founder (e.g., an hour-long interview session per week), with the agency handling all backend operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

The value is seen as a return on audience spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. Founders understand that paying a service to generate leads through a newsletter is a worthwhile investment if it brings in high-value customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>.

## The Importance of Owned Media for Founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>
Building an audience on platforms like YouTube or a newsletter is crucial for founders because it provides "owned media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. This means founders have control over their content and distribution, reducing dependence on external platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

> [!INFO] "Schmuck Insurance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>
> Being reliant on a single platform is a bad idea. Moving followers to email or text lists acts as "schmuck insurance," protecting against algorithm changes or platform instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. The tagline could be "Don't be a schmuck, have an email list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

Owned media allows for sustainable growth and can make a company cash flow positive within 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. It enables deep trust in a one-to-many format, generating inbound interest for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.

### Founder-Led Media Companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>
A growing trend is that founders are essentially becoming media companies themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. This shift allows founders to build a personal brand and generate inbound leads for their companies through free reach on platforms like LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This strategy is comparable to how some VCs used platforms like Tech Twitter to attract the best founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

## Practical Implementation & Scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>

### Attracting Founders
To acquire founders as clients, one could build their own channel on a platform like LinkedIn, demonstrating their clip-making and posting expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. A community play could involve creating a free community for founders looking to grow on LinkedIn, then upselling them into a service once they realize the difficulty of doing it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Community Strategy for LinkedIn Growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>
> A suggested community strategy involves:
> 1.  Owning a domain like "FoundersGoingViralOnLinkedIn.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
> 2.  Creating a free community offering weekly tips on going viral on LinkedIn and breaking down successful founder content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
> 3.  Hosting monthly peer-to-peer calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
> 4.  At the end of these calls, pitching the "done-for-you" service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

### Pricing Structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>
*   **Entry-level**: Around $2,500 a month for basic content creation and scheduling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Mid-tier**: $5,000 to $8,000 a month could include lead magnets as a service (e.g., creating a drip course monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Add-on**: Design help for banners, cover art, and infographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

### Riding Larger Trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
When building a company, it's wise to attach oneself to a larger trend rather than trying to educate the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This means selling solutions that people already desire, such as services for creators benefiting from LinkedIn's new algorithmic feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

Even if a platform trend shifts (e.g., LinkedIn's video-first approach changes), a business that has built relationships with founders can pivot and sell them another relevant service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

## Founder's Mindset for Media Creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>
Creating content is a grind, but it's not as demanding as often perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. The hardest part is showing up consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. Founders should focus on:
*   Developing their tone, voice, personality, style, and content format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.
*   Building a system to bring in a pipeline of content ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
*   Thinking of themselves as an editor or curator, a "conductor of the orchestra" rather than playing every instrument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Startup Origin Story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>
> Building owned media, especially a YouTube channel, can serve as a "leverage point" for individuals without traditional pedigree, allowing anyone globally with good ideas to gain visibility and get paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>. This approach makes content creation accessible and profitable.

## Other Business Ideas and Strategies Related to Media/Content for Founders

### AI-Driven Graphic Design Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:56">[02:22:56]</a>
There's a need for an AI graphic design tool that takes a brand's style guide (colors, logos, fonts) and generates various assets like podcast thumbnails or email headers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:56">[02:22:56]</a>. The tool doesn't need to be perfect, just "good enough" to provide a strong starting point for further human refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>. This could be a B2B SaaS product, potentially undercutting existing services like Design Pickle (which charges $499/month) with a $99/month AI-augmented alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:55">[02:26:55]</a>.

### YouTube Thumbnail and Title Library as a Subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:56">[03:09:56]</a>
With YouTube's strong monetization and dominance in the creator space, there's an opportunity to create a library of plug-and-play YouTube thumbnails and titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:56">[03:09:56]</a>. The service would allow users to swap out assets (e.g., faces) and provide data-backed insights on which thumbnail/title combinations perform best (impressions, views) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. This business could be marketed by cold-emailing YouTubers with specific subscriber counts and categories, offering free access to a limited number of templates and then upsell to a premium tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:48">[03:10:48]</a>.

### B2B AI Automation Consulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:36">[03:16:36]</a>
There's a surge in demand for "AI automation" solutions, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), as large consulting firms like McKinsey focus on enterprise clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:15">[03:17:15]</a>. This could be a consulting firm setting up automation systems using tools like Make.com, Zapier, and ChatGPT APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:05">[03:17:05]</a>. A more advanced model could offer an embedded AI automation engineer service, charging around $8,000 a month due to instant cost savings for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:51">[03:17:51]</a>. Distribution could involve bidding on keywords related to AI automation tools and creating tutorials with calls to action for consulting services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:15">[03:18:15]</a>.

### Niche Bookkeeping/Accounting Software ("QuickBooks for X") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>
Inspired by "Finaloop" which provides e-commerce accounting software, the idea is to niche down generic bookkeeping software like QuickBooks to specific industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. Examples include "QuickBooks for SAS," "QuickBooks for Agencies," or "QuickBooks for Real Estate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>. The best niche can be identified by researching QuickBooks extensions to see which industries are most commonly integrating with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. The focus should be on underserved niches with less competition from well-funded companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.

### Video Captioning App for Canva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>
Canva, despite being a fast-growing video editor, lacks good video captioning features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>. An app could be built that allows users to upload a video, automatically transcribe it using a Whisper model, and add styled captions (with different variations like karaoke) using Canva's built-in font styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. This could be a profitable small company (e.g., $20k/month) leveraging Canva's massive distribution, potentially leading to an acquisition by Canva itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.

### Revitalized Cheap Flight Newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>
Building on the eroded "Scott's Cheap Flights" model (now Going.com), a new low-code newsletter can aggregate cheap flight deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. Google Flights allows users to set alerts for dramatic price drops between cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. The business would target "frequent traveler" interests on Facebook ads, directing them to a newsletter that aggregates these Google Flights deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. [[Monetization methods for newsletters | Monetization]] could be through subscriptions and affiliate kickbacks from travel booking sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>. This could be scaled to all major U.S. metros, then internationally, and built on platforms like Beehiiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>. The email list would grow organically through forwarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, and could also be expanded to include local news for stickiness, becoming part of [[building_and_scaling_local_newsletters | building and scaling local newsletters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.

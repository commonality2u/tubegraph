Midjourney is considered a new medium entirely, offering a different type of canvas and a different way of problem-solving for artists and creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead of just paint, users can blend and balance entire aesthetics with complex layers to achieve desired harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Once a successful "recipe" is found, it can be infinitely prompted into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Moving Beyond Word Prompts

While words are useful, they are only the "tip of the iceberg" in Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The true power lies in using visuals to drive visuals, rather than relying solely on semantics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This approach allows for the explosion of aesthetics and style space into almost infinite directions, freeing users from relying on the base model's interpretation of style tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Historically, Midjourney primarily relied on structuring text prompts and describing every detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. However, recent months have seen the release of "Style Space," including style references and character references, which vastly expands aesthetic possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Utilizing the Midjourney Web App

For an optimal experience, users are encouraged to use the Midjourney web app at midjourney.com instead of Discord, which is described as a "hellish place to be" for this work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

Key features of the web app include:
*   **Create Tab**: Where most of the prompting and generation takes place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Explore Tab**: A source of inspiration where publicly available generations are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Users can search for specific styles, image search for similar results, or use existing prompts or styles as a starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Stealth Mode**: Available on the Pro Plan or above, this setting ensures client work or private imagery does not appear in the public database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. It can be toggled in the settings of the prompt bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Favorites**: Liking generated images makes them easily findable later in the "Organize" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

## Why Use Midjourney?

Midjourney serves multiple purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>:
*   **Professional Tool**: It's an excellent tool for inspiration, jamming out ideas, building mood boards, and ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. It offers more control than traditional image searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Production**: With features like the new editor, it can be used for production, out-painting, and adding new elements to existing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Art Therapy**: Many users find it simply fun and can get lost in the creative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Discovery Engine**: It helps users explore aesthetics and go down "rabbit holes" of discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[01:00:05]</a>.
*   **Creative Control**: Midjourney offers the most creative control over the aesthetic direction of AI-generated art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## Incorporating Visual Inputs

Images can be incorporated into Midjourney prompts in different ways, each with distinct effects:

### Image Prompts vs. Style References
Dragging an image into the prompt bar defaults it to an "image prompt" (represented by a pict icon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. In this mode, Midjourney attempts to pull the subject matter and actual pixels of the image into the generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Increasing the image weight will make the model try to include more elements from the image, potentially leading to "wonky" results if the aim is solely stylistic influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

A "style reference" (represented by a paperclip icon) is crucial for controlling aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. When an image is used as a style reference, Midjourney analyzes it to understand its inherent style by decoupling aesthetic from subject matter, then integrates those stylistic elements into the new image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

### Parameters and Aesthetic Levers
Several parameters act as "aesthetic levers" to guide and push aesthetics:
*   **Style Weight (`--sw`)**: Determines how much influence the style reference has over the generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The default is 100, but it can go up to 1000 for stronger influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratio (`--ar`)**: Changes the layout, useful for specific formats like posters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **No Parameter (`--no`)**: Instructs Midjourney to remove specific elements from the generation, such as "no text" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.
*   **Stylize (`--s`)**: Controls how much of the Midjourney model's curated aesthetics are applied to the text prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. High stylize values (e.g., 1000) will make images look "more AI" or like the model's default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.

### Personalization
Midjourney's "personalization" feature allows the model to learn a user's aesthetic preferences through image rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. By selecting favorite images in the "Personalize" tab, Midjourney learns preferences for colors, lighting, general style (photographic vs. illustrative), and even subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. This fine-tunes the model to the user's taste, providing a totally different aesthetic universe compared to the community-curated default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. It's recommended to rate at least a thousand images to significantly improve results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

### Style Reference Codes (SRF)
SRF codes are like "coordinates" in a multi-dimensional "Style Space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. These codes direct the AI to a specific location of aesthetic influence, impacting anything prompted within that "universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. There are billions of possible SRF codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. Users can "mine" these codes, curate them into lists, and blend them with their personalization and text prompts to build "aesthetic recipes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

SRF codes represent various elements like color, composition, lighting, texture, and pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. They can be blended together like paint on a palette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. Weights can be applied to individual SRF codes within a prompt (e.g., `srf_code_1::2 srf_code_2::1`) to control their relative influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

By combining style references, personalization, text prompts, and parameters, users gain extensive control over the aesthetic direction, moving beyond the limitations of purely text-based interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. This allows for the creation of unique and complex "style potions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>.

## Future Applications

There is a growing movement to physically manifest AI art, moving it beyond digital existence. This includes projects like building labs with robots learning to paint and play music, and using large-format printers and 3D printers to bring digital creations to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>. This enables creators to transform ideas into tangible design assets that can be displayed, used on websites, or shared as social assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.

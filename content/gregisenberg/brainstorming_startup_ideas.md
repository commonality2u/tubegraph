This article summarizes a discussion between Greg and Daniel Dalen about generating, evaluating, and building startup ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The conversation covers various insights, from identifying opportunities in everyday life to strategic approaches for building and scaling businesses.

## Generating Ideas

The process of coming up with startup ideas often involves observing the real world and understanding fundamental human behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Human beings don't change, so applying established ways of thinking to new niches can yield opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

### Plaque/Badge Business Idea

This idea was sparked by observing a dental office displaying a "best dentist in America" plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The concept involves creating and selling digital badges or physical plaques, similar to the Better Business Bureau's rating image, to businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These plaques would signify "Best Product of the Year" or "Best E-commerce Brand of the Year," adding credibility to websites or products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

*   **Insight:** Businesses are always seeking credibility, as seen with logos of trusted partners or testimonials on websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Precedent:** Similar models exist, such as Product Hunt's "Product of the Day" plaques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, and the Better Business Bureau, which generates millions by selling its legitimacy image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Monetization:** Businesses like Granola (an [[ai_tools_for_startup_ideas | AI notepad]]) might pay $200 a year for a digital sticker and a physical plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **High Margin:** This business has a potentially high profit margin (99%) as it sells an image or badge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Key Challenge:** Making noise and establishing authority are crucial to ensure companies value the badge enough to pay for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Embeddable Businesses

The concept of "embeddable businesses" refers to owning "real estate" on other people's websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This idea came from Greg's project, `offerbutton.com`, which allows users to embed a button on their website to receive offers to buy the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

*   **Benefit:** Embeddable businesses provide consistent traffic by being present on sites people visit daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Marketing:** They act as automatic marketing, similar to "sent with Gmail" at the bottom of emails or the "sent with Zero" on invoices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This leverages the authority of the host website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Typeform or similar survey tools are considered embeddable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### "Login with Influencer" Idea (Bad Idea, Good Insight)

This idea proposes a system where influencers could log in to e-commerce sites to see different products or lower price points based on their social status (e.g., YouTube subscribers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.

*   **Potential Issue:** It could create a "dual class system" where non-influencers feel excluded, potentially impacting conversion rates for e-commerce brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.
*   **Better Approach:** Instead of a public-facing button, brands could use a filtering system or scrape social profiles to proactively offer benefits to relevant influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.
*   **Lesson:** A "bad idea" can still contain valuable insights, leading one step closer to a working product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.

### Focus on Pain Points

Identifying and understanding specific pain points is crucial when building any product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>. This often comes from personal experience or deep dives into a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.

### The "Car Doesn't Drive" Analogy

Building a product is like building a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. A car might look nice with all the bells and whistles, but if it doesn't drive, no one will buy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. The core value proposition—getting from A to B—must be established first, even if it starts as a bike or skateboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

### Testing and Feedback

Putting an idea "out there in the wild" with a simple visual or question to gauge interest and gather feedback is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. This helps in [[successful_startup_ideas_and_validation_techniques | validating techniques]] and understanding if the idea resonates with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

## Approaches to Building a Startup

### Market Positioning: Luxury vs. Aesthetic vs. Costco

Businesses can position themselves across a spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>:
*   **Luxury Software:** Like Superhuman, which is more expensive and looks premium, often integrating status symbols like "sent with Superhuman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Aesthetic Software:** A new wave focusing on design and visual appeal, often subconsciously conveying that the user takes design seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. This can contribute significantly to the perceived value of a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
*   **Costco/Kirkland of Software:** Like Zoho, offering a massive suite of products at lower prices, focusing on breadth and affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and Aesthetics

While the core functionality (making the "car drive") is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>, a good aesthetic can significantly grab attention in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

*   **Landing Page:** An aesthetically pleasing landing page for an MVP is crucial, even if the product itself is simple or "ugly" initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.
*   **Simple Design Elements:** Using a nice font, bumping up font size, a good header, and a simple logo can make a landing page look good with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.
*   **Tools:** Platforms like Vzer or Framer can help create basic, aesthetically pleasing landing pages quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. Animations can also enhance a landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

### Shopify Ecosystem Opportunity

The Shopify app ecosystem presents significant opportunities for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) is a large space with substantial money flow, making it easier to justify subscription fees for solutions that save time, increase convenience, or boost conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>.

*   **Identifying Pain Points:** To [[building_startup_ideas_around_niche_trends | niche]] down and find opportunities, one must deeply understand specific pain points within the DTC landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>. This could involve segments like:
    *   Supply chain and dealing with international manufacturers (e.g., China) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.
    *   Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.
    *   Email marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>.
    *   After-sales service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
    *   Store building (e.g., instant page builders like Instant.so, which uses [[ai_tools_for_startup_ideas | AI to generate Liquid components]] for Shopify themes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.
*   **Examples of Shopify Apps:**
    *   **Instant.so:** An instant page builder that creates optimized Shopify stores quickly using templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.
    *   **Fulfillment App:** A tool that integrates Last Mile carriers (like USPS) to hide the China origin of shipments for a better customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.
*   **Competitive Landscape:** Niche down further within these areas (e.g., CRO for local construction workers) to create a moat and avoid competing with large players like Google or Shopify's own offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.

### Acquisition vs. Bootstrapping

Entrepreneurs can choose to build a business with the goal of being acquired by a larger company (playing a "slot machine" hoping stars align) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>, or focus on [[successful_startup_ideas_and_validation_techniques | bootstrapping]] a cash-flow positive business that grows organically (playing "poker" by understanding odds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>. The latter often provides more freedom and less stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.

## General Philosophy

*   **Making Noise:** Generating buzz and traffic (supply) is crucial for success, then converting that into demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Freedom and Happiness:** The ultimate goal is to build something that makes you happy, earns enough money, and allows for freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>.
*   **Efficiency:** Leveraging automation and [[utilizing_ai_for_startup_idea_generation | AI]] to reduce recurring meetings and achieve an "empty calendar" can lead to greater freedom and fun in building a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   **Content as Marketing:** Documenting the journey of building a brand and sharing lessons along the way is an effective, authentic form of marketing that avoids overtly "selling" to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

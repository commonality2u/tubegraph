This article discusses an approach to earning money by selling [[ai_and_upwork_selling_services | AI services]] and custom applications on platforms like Upwork, focusing on strategy, execution, and monetization. This method allows individuals to make a significant income, potentially $5,000 to $20,000 per month as solo developers or with a small team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## Approach to Upwork Projects

The core strategy involves validating demand before building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>. Instead of building an app and then trying to find users, it's easier to find someone who wants to buy an app and then build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

### Finding Clients and Project Ideas

Upwork is presented as a valuable resource for finding clients and identifying business problems that can be solved with a custom app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

Key search strategies include:
*   **Replacing Existing Software** Look for jobs asking for solutions using existing software like AirTable, then propose a custom, potentially cheaper and better app solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Keywords like "AirTable" or "automations" are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.
*   **"Custom App Development"** can also be searched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on CRUD Apps** Prioritize apps that are easy to build and deploy, typically "CRUD" (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications, which involve putting data in a database, pulling it, and visualizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

### Project Selection and Proposal

When evaluating Upwork listings, consider the complexity and potential for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Avoid projects requiring deep integration with many services (like Calendly, Zapier, SMS) initially, as these can involve extensive developer documentation research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

Once a suitable project is identified (e.g., a case management and assistance tracking system for a nonprofit, or a custom workflow for parent inquiries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>, the next step is to create a compelling proposal.

*   **Prototype and Loom Video** For simpler apps, build a prototype and send a Loom video demonstrating it in the proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. This acts as pre-building validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   **Direct Communication** Alternatively, communicate directly with the client, highlighting experience with relevant technologies (e.g., AirTable, HubSpot, Google Sheets) and offering to build in either their preferred tool or a custom solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

## Pricing and Monetization

[[pricing_strategies_and_subscription_models | Pricing strategies and monetization]] on Upwork projects should consider both immediate payment and long-term revenue.

*   **Fixed Price Projects** Projects often have a fixed price. While some offers may seem low (e.g., $125 for a basic system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>, it's possible to submit a proposal with a higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
*   **Initial Pricing** A first project might be priced around $750 to get a foot in the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.
*   **Market Due Diligence** Research other similar requests on Upwork to understand potential pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. Some clients might pay significantly more (e.g., $12,000 for a similar project) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.
*   **Recurring Revenue** After the initial build, opportunities exist for recurring revenue by charging for future feature add-ons and ongoing hosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:40:00">[38:40:00]</a>. This transitions into a [[pay_for_performance_agency_model | dev agency]] model for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:45:00">[38:45:00]</a>.
*   **Upwork Connects** Upwork uses a "Connects" system to apply for jobs and boost visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.

### Earning Potential

*   **Solo Developers:** It's possible for solo developers to easily clear $5,000 to $10,000 a month without outside help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.
*   **Agencies:** With a team, earnings can exceed six figures annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:50:00">[23:50:00]</a>.

## Building with AI Coding Assistants ("Vibe Coding")

The process leverages [[pricing_and_freetier_exploration_of_ai_coding_platforms | AI coding platforms]] to rapidly build applications.

### Tool Stack

*   **ChatGPT:** Used to format project descriptions into a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for an AI coding assistant, specifying requirements and data types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.
*   **Replet:** Preferred for its ability to go from idea to MVP with minimal friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. It handles package management, installation, deployment, and testing easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. Replet V2 uses Cloud 3.7 and scaffolds a basic UI immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:00">[26:33:00]</a>.
    *   **Agent Autonomy:** Replet's agent autonomously scaffolds the app based on the PRD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[00:17:04]</a>.
    *   **Database Integration:** It can integrate Postgress databases for user data storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>.
    *   **API Keys:** API keys can be securely stored and reused across projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:03:00">[44:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Bounties:** Replet offers a "Bounties" feature to hire developers for specific tasks or troubleshooting, which can be cost-effective ($50 for troubleshooting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.
*   **VO (Visual Interface):** Used for upgrading the UI and generating mockups, especially from wireframes. It can generate front-end code that can be pulled into Replet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:56:00">[39:56:00]</a>.
*   **Cursor/Windsurf:** Used for editing code when stuck in loops or for complex issues, allowing for direct prompting within the IDE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>.

### Development Process

1.  **Format Requirements:** Paste the Upwork job description into ChatGPT and ask it to format the requirements as a PRD for an AI coding assistant, specifying an agnostic tech stack but mentioning preferred UI libraries like Shad CN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.
2.  **Generate Prototype:** Feed the PRD into Replet, instructing it to build the app and use desired UI components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. Replet will often ask about additional features like database integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.
3.  **Refine UI:** If a more polished UI is desired, describe the page in VO to generate front-end code, then paste it back into Replet to replace existing components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:43:00">[40:43:00]</a>.
4.  **Deployment and Ownership:** Apps can be deployed to a custom domain directly from Replet or pushed to GitHub for deployment elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:04:00">[43:04:00]</a>. For small projects, negotiating IP ownership isn't typically necessary; a standard boilerplate agreement is sufficient unless future personal use of the IP is planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:36:00">[42:36:00]</a>.

### Considerations for Production Apps

*   **TLC (Tender Loving Care):** While AI speeds up development, human oversight is needed to ensure the app is production-ready and to anticipate how users might break it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>.
*   **Complex Features:** Features like payments, DocuSign integrations, or calendar functionalities (due to date and timezone issues) can be more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>.
*   **API Integrations:** Basic API "get" calls are usually straightforward, but "post" requests that change data in other services require careful attention to security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>.
*   **Hiring Help:** Consider hiring specialized developers from platforms like Replet's bounties to handle complex tasks or final quality checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>.

## Selling Philosophy: Service vs. SaaS

This approach aligns with [[b2b_versus_b2c_approaches_for_startups | B2B versus B2C approaches for startups]], favoring a service-oriented model over traditional SaaS (Software as a Service) for individual developers.

*   **Service-Oriented (Consulting):** This method is essentially [[strategies_for_pricing_and_monetization_in_ai | consulting]] using AI to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:00">[28:46:00]</a>. It involves getting paid upfront, de-risking the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:57:00">[34:57:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding SaaS (Money Pit):** Building a multi-million dollar SaaS is described as a "nightmare" and a "money pit" due to high marketing costs and the need for significant "juice" (distribution and audience building skills) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits of Service Model:**
    *   **Less Risk:** Projects are de-risked by securing payment upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:57:00">[34:57:00]</a>.
    *   **Continuous Learning:** Working on multiple projects (e.g., 40 apps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:00">[27:44:00]</a> provides diverse learning opportunities with different libraries and APIs, increasing "surface area of luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:32:00">[30:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Client Relationships:** B2B clients (business owners) are generally more pleasant to work with than a large base of B2C users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03:00">[32:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Scalability:** A custom solution built for one client with a specific problem can be replicated and sold to other businesses with the same issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:54:00">[30:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:00">[31:35:00]</a>.
    *   **Paid Learning:** Engaging in these projects means "getting paid to learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:06:00">[45:06:00]</a>.

### Future Opportunities

The speaker anticipates a future where AI can "unbundle" existing SaaS products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43:00">[35:43:00]</a>. This means an AI could reverse engineer a SaaS (like Ahrefs) using public APIs to build a much cheaper clone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:00">[37:17:00]</a>. This represents an interesting way to find new app ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>.

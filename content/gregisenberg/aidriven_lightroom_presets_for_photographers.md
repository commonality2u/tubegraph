## Overview
Lightroom presets are tools used by photographers to achieve a specific style or aesthetic for their photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. An entire economy exists around people selling these preset packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. An opportunity exists to disrupt this market by leveraging AI to generate these presets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## The AI Solution
The core idea is to create a subscription software for photographers that uses AI to generate Lightroom presets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

### How it Works
1.  A user uploads a photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
2.  AI analyzes the photo and creates the XML code necessary to generate the Lightroom preset that matches the desired aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
3.  These XML packets can be created at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
4.  The photographer can then download this automatically generated plugin and import it directly into Lightroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

This approach solves the issue of manual adjustments, allowing users to build any preset they want using AI image recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Business Model
The proposed model is a subscription service, for example, $29 a month, providing access to unlimited preset creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. The profit margin on this is nearly infinite, around 99% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>, as it's primarily code generation.

### Service Offerings
The service could offer two main options:
*   Allow customers to upload a source photo and build their own custom preset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   Maintain a library of pre-generated XML presets for users to download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

To build the library, the company could scrape photos and keywords for popular preset styles (e.g., "boho Lightroom presets") and automatically generate the corresponding XML files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

## Marketing and Growth Strategy
The market for Lightroom presets is substantial, with significant search volume for specific preset types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

### Key Strategies:
*   **Targeted Ads:** Run Facebook ads specifically targeting users with an interest in Photoshop, Lightroom, or Adobe products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **SEO via Niche Domains:** Acquire a large portfolio of long-tail keyword domains (e.g., "boho Lightroom preset.com") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. These domains can be effectively ranked on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>, creating a top-of-funnel lead generation system that funnels users to the subscription service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   **Lead Magnet:** Offer a free pack of 10 presets to capture user emails and then use drip nurture campaigns to upsell them into the subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

### Asset Valuation
Building a portfolio of these lead-generating domains can create a valuable asset. This strategy, similar to "rank and rent" models seen in industries like personal injury law, allows companies to sell the entire portfolio of lead-generating websites to private equity or other interested parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. These portfolios are considered "digital real estate" on the front page of Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

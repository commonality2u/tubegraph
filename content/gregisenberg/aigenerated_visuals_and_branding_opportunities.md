Brett, a one-man designer from Designjoy, generates millions of dollars annually by utilizing [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] to create striking designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The process of arriving at beautifully generated graphics is surprisingly simple, with no hidden "magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. These tools are powerful and easy to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Getting Started with AI Visuals

The field of [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] offers various generative applications, including image and video generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Most content is not geared solely towards designers, allowing anyone with a Midjourney or Chat (GPT) subscription to create stunning visuals without prior design knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. While good taste helps, a lack of creative skill is not a barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Higgsfield: Easy Entry for Product Ads

For those new to [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] creation, Higsfield is an accessible tool that provides templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. One of the biggest challenges in [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] is knowing how to communicate with the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Higsfield simplifies this by offering preset actions and effects, eliminating the need for complex prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

For instance, to create an ad for a drink company, you can select a preset, upload a product image, and generate a video that automatically considers the product's branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This tool can swap models and maintain text on the product, overcoming a past "problem child" of [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. It's a quick way to create cool ads for platforms like Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Core Tools: Midjourney and ChatGPT

While many [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] tools emerge constantly (Cling, Korea, Visual Electric, Flora) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, Midjourney and ChatGPT are predominantly used together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

#### Midjourney for Artistic Styling

Midjourney excels at artistic styling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It can generate artistic images such as vintage aerial photos of a golf course or brand directions for a surfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. It's the go-to tool for creating truly artistic visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

In Midjourney, you use prompts to tell it what you want, along with image prompts and style references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. An image prompt might introduce elements like a person or a surfboard from a reference photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. A style reference applies specific colors, shadows, highlights, and depth of field from a source image to the generated output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Mixing different styles can lead to surprising results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

#### ChatGPT for Prompt Generation

The quality of [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] systems depends on the prompts or reference images provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. While prompting was once a specialized skill requiring author-level writing, ChatGPT has made it accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Prompting is no longer a "skill" that can be gatekept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

ChatGPT is excellent at generating prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. For example, by providing a simple idea like "a zoomed-in photo of a cowboy in the back of a horse holding the reins, zoomed in on the hands and reins," ChatGPT can generate several detailed prompt options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. It can also be guided conversationally to refine prompts, such as focusing on a cowboy's hat or a horse's face, while adding rich descriptive details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

#### Combining Midjourney and ChatGPT

The starting point for high-quality [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] art is a well-constructed prompt, which can be created using ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This prompt is then used in Midjourney, often alongside a style image from sources like Pinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. The combination allows users to generate diverse image collections with consistent themes or styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

### Adding Motion with AI (Runway, Cling, Korea)

Still images generated by Midjourney can be brought into tools like Runway to add motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Runway is among the "upper echelon" of quality for [[potential_business_opportunities_with_aidriven_video_creation | AI-driven video creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

The process involves uploading an image and providing a prompt (generated by ChatGPT) that describes the desired movement, such as "soft ripples in the water," "smoke coming," or "trees blowing softly in the wind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Runway can produce beautiful videos, typically 5 to 10 seconds long, in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

Other tools like Cling also offer image-to-video capabilities, including start and end frame looping for seamless, endlessly repeating videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Cling also features an [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] sound button that provides generated audio options relevant to the video's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. For longer continuous shots, the last frame of one video can be saved and uploaded as the starting frame for the next, then stitched together using basic video editing tools like Cap Cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

### Enhancing Visuals

Generated visuals can be further enhanced using tools like Photoshop for generative fill, or Magnific Upscaler for adding super-rich details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This layering of tools allows for the creation of "dope stuff" that is hard to replicate without knowing how to use them in tandem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Videos can also be upscaled to 4K quality with a single click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

## Business Opportunities and Applications

The current opportunities with [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]]-generated visuals extend beyond simple creative exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

### Branding and Consistent Assets

The biggest opportunity for creatives using [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] is on the branding side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. While web design hasn't fully matured in [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] yet (tools like Bolt.new and Lovable have mediocre output) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>, branding with [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] is "amazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

Midjourney allows for the creation of "mood boards," using a code as a prompt to ensure continuity and consistency across generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. This means a user can quickly replicate and build new creative assets that are cohesive with an established brand aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

However, current [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] tools are not proficient in logo design, generating entire brands, perfect text, or vector art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. Designers are still needed for these specific tasks, but once these foundational pieces are set, [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] provides the ability to generate consistent assets at a rapid pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. This capability to generate consistent [[aigenerated_assets_for_mobile_app_development | AI-generated assets]] is a significant leverage point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

### Ad Creation and Marketing

[[aigenerated_ugc_ads_and_marketing | AI-generated videos]] are highly useful for ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. While [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] tools can sometimes embed text, for precise placement, it's best to export the video and add text layers in a user-friendly video platform like Cap Cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. This allows for flexible positioning without needing extensive video editing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

Examples include generating psychedelic background images for e-commerce product shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. The ability to create stunning visuals that previously would have been impossible for non-creatives, or even many creatives, is now possible in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.

### Accessibility for Non-Creatives

A key takeaway is the accessibility of these tools. Non-creatives can generate beautiful visuals that were previously unattainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The process is not complicated; it involves having a basic idea, prompting ChatGPT, plugging the output into Midjourney, and adding a chosen style reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

## Considerations and Limitations

[[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]] tools like Midjourney and Runway are not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. They can sometimes produce unexpected or "finicky" results, like a cartoon character popping out of a 3D logo rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. Users need to understand what the tools are good at and be prepared to adjust prompts or retry if artifacts or strange outputs occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

## Conclusion

The world of [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | AI]]-generated visuals offers remarkable opportunities to create professional-quality designs with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.

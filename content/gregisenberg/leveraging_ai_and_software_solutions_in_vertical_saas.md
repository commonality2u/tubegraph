Vertical SaaS refers to industry-specific software, which offers significant opportunities for entrepreneurs to build enduring and profitable businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach is considered more of a science than an art, focusing on specific industries rather than broad ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Why Vertical SaaS is Promising

Historically, software use cases were tied to businesses to optimize operations, create efficiency, and generate cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. However, in the last 10-15 years, many founders shifted towards chasing massive, multi-billion-dollar "unicorn" opportunities in broader markets to attract venture capital (VC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This led to a move away from industry-specific software, as these markets are often constrained and may not offer the extraordinary outcomes VCs seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Despite this, there remains significant opportunity in specialized, often "boring," industries that are overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These businesses can be built to be enduring, with strong customer retention, even if they don't always exhibit the rapid growth rates desired by VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Luke Sfinos, a vertical SaaS advisor, highlights his own experience building a multi-million-dollar vertical SaaS business in the "boring" trade school industry as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## A Scientific Approach to [[building_a_vertical_saas_business | Building a Vertical SaaS Business]]

### 1. Picking an Industry, Not an Idea

The foundational step in [[building_a_vertical_saas_business | building a vertical SaaS business]] is to focus on a specific industry, not an initial idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This process involves a checklist of characteristics that make an industry a good target:

*   **Market Size (Revenue)**: How much revenue do the companies in the industry generate? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> For example, General Medical and Surgical Hospitals in the US generate nearly a trillion dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Number of Companies and Segmentation**: This is crucial. An industry with many companies indicates less enterprise-driven sales, which is typically easier for bootstrapped startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Ideal markets have a healthy mix of small businesses (a couple of million in revenue), mid-market businesses (tens to hundreds of millions in revenue), and enterprise businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This allows a software company to enter with a smaller feature set, gain traction, and then expand capabilities to serve larger clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

    *   **Example: Machine Shops**: This industry is highlighted as a perfect place to [[building_a_vertical_saas_business | build a vertical SaaS company]] due to its size ($240 billion in revenue) and healthy segmentation (22,000 companies, averaging $2 million in revenue, with a mix of small, mid-market, and few enterprise players) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

> "The best markets to look for are you know bigger bigger the better right especially if you're doing a venture kind of opportunity if you're doing bootstrap it doesn't need to be that big but um a solid amount of operating revenue and then the better the segmentation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>

### 2. Understanding the Industry's Operations

Once an industry is chosen, the next step is to deeply understand its end-to-end operations, even if you lack prior domain expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

*   **Map the Customer Journey/Operations**: Visualize every aspect of how businesses within the industry operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
    *   **Example: Toast's S1**: The publicly traded restaurant software company, Toast, visualized every aspect of a restaurant's operations (back office, kitchen, bar, delivery, marketing) in their S1 filing to identify software opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
    *   **Example: Corsky (Trade Schools)**: The operations of a trade school involve admissions, training (often in a garage-like setting), IT, student services, compliance, and placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Mapping these processes helps identify where software can play a role in creating efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Analyze Profit & Loss (P&L) Statements**: Obtain as many P&Ls as possible from businesses in the target industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
    *   Look at publicly traded companies or consult with industry bankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
    *   Identify where companies are spending money, especially on people who could be automated with software, or on existing software solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
    *   Software should aim to:
        1.  Increase Revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>
        2.  Decrease Costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>
        3.  Prevent Customer Churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>
        4.  Maintain Compliance (for highly regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>

### 3. Analyzing Existing Software Solutions and Competition

It's critical to understand the competitive landscape before building. Don't start with a software idea; instead, analyze existing solutions after mapping out industry operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

*   **Legacy Providers**: Are there old, entrenched ERPs or systems that try to do everything A-Z? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>
*   **Horizontal Software Fragmentation**: Do businesses in the industry stitch together generic horizontal solutions (e.g., general CRMs, Slack, Gmail, Zoho) that aren't industry-specific? This indicates a strong need for an all-in-one vertical solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Paper Processes**: Surprisingly, many industries still rely on paper processes for critical functions like job tracking, scheduling, tooling, inventory, or machine maintenance logs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. These represent prime [[identifying_market_opportunities_for_vertical_saas | opportunities for vertical SaaS]] to digitize and improve efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

## [[leveraging_ai_in_startup_development | Leveraging AI in Startup Development]]

AI can be a powerful research assistant, particularly in the initial stages of [[identifying_ai_saas_startup_opportunities | identifying AI SaaS startup opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

*   **Market Research**: AI tools like ChatGPT can quickly provide high-level information on market size, revenue, and segmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
*   **Mapping Operations**: AI can assist in outlining the end-to-end operations of an industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>, such as a machine shop's process from customer inquiry to shipping and follow-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.
*   **Identifying Software Gaps**: AI can help pinpoint where software solutions are prevalent and suggest areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. More specifically, AI can identify:
    *   **Areas still relying on pen and paper**: e.g., job tracking, tooling, inventory, machine maintenance logs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.
    *   **Areas not leveraging AI**: e.g., predictive maintenance, optimized job scheduling, automated quality control, energy management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. This represents significant [[using_ai_to_build_saas_apps | AI opportunity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.
    *   **Areas using multiple horizontal solutions**: e.g., project management with generic apps like Trello or Asana, generic CRMs, or accounting software lacking industry-specific features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

> "AI is a incredibly helpful kind of assistant for anybody listening to go [[starting_a_saas_business_using_ai_tools | build a vertical SaaS]]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>

Crucially, while AI can provide insights, these findings must be validated with real-world interactions, such as shadowing businesses or interviewing owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.

## Go-to-Market Strategy

Understanding how to distribute your product is as important as the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

*   **Study Successful Vertical SaaS Companies**: Analyze how scaled companies in the chosen space acquired their first 10, 100, or 1,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
*   **Product-Led vs. Sales-Led**: Many vertical industries have traditionally required heavy outside sales models, involving relationship-building and in-person interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. VCs often prefer product-led or marketing-led customer acquisition due to their faster growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
*   **Media and Social**: Evaluate if building a media presence or leveraging social media can be an effective customer acquisition strategy for the specific industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. For example, a niche newsletter with inside jokes for machine shop workers could be an unconventional yet effective way to build an audience and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.

## Wedge Products

A "wedge product" is a crucial strategy for [[building a niche AI SaaS business | building a niche AI SaaS business]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.

*   **Definition**: A wedge product is your "get in the door" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>. The ultimate goal in vertical SaaS is to be the all-in-one solution, but no one starts there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.
*   **Characteristics**:
    *   Addresses a critical pain point for the customer.
    *   Targets an area with poor or paper-based existing solutions.
    *   Is easy to implement and deploy quickly (not a 12-month implementation).
    *   Acts as a "reputation prover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
*   **Case Study: Roofer.com**: This company built software for roofing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. Instead of starting with an all-in-one ERP, their wedge product was a free proposal tool that used Google Maps to provide instant roofing quotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. Roofer.com took a small percentage of successful bookings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. This marketing-led approach was unheard of in the home services industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>. This free, valuable tool built trust and allowed them to then upsell to paid CRM and eventually an all-in-one solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

## Monetization: The Power of Payments

Adding integrated payment processing to a vertical SaaS solution is a powerful way to [[utilizing_ai_for_scaling_and_automation | build massive companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

*   **Owning the Transaction**: Every major industry-specific software company aims to own the financial transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.
*   **Market Size Expansion**: By taking a percentage of transactions, the market size can grow exponentially compared to just charging a flat SaaS fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.
    *   **Example: Toast**: If Toast only charged $10/month for restaurant software to 1 million US restaurants, the total market size would be $120 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>. However, since those restaurants generate $1 trillion in revenue, taking even a small percentage of transactions makes the market opportunity massively larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.
*   **Customer Convenience and ROI**: Integrating payments directly into the software makes it much easier for customers, who would otherwise rely on fragmented solutions like PayPal and manual reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

## Pricing Framework

Pricing is often an afterthought in software, but it should be a core consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.

*   **Value-Based Pricing**: Understand how much the problem you are solving currently costs the customer, or how much value you are creating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.
    *   **Example: Student Retention Tool**: For trade schools losing students, a tool that analyzes academic data to identify at-risk students and automatically texts them could save schools millions in lost tuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. If a student's tuition is $20,000, saving just five students represents $100,000 in saved revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.
*   **ROI-Driven Pricing**: Price your product by demonstrating a clear Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>. Charge a portion (e.g., 20-50%) of the money you either make for them or save for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.
*   **Focus on Key Benefits**: Only build products that clearly:
    1.  Increase Revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>
    2.  Decrease Costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>
    3.  Prevent Customer Churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>
    4.  Help with Compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a>

This systematic approach, combining market analysis, operational understanding, competitive assessment, [[using_ai_to_build_a_saas_startup | leveraging AI]], and strategic product and pricing models, provides a robust framework for [[building_a_vertical_saas_business | building a vertical SaaS business]].

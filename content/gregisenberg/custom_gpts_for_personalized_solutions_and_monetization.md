From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

The advent of a new AI world presents opportunities for building diverse ideas, particularly focusing on what remains constant amidst rapid change and how technology can offer personalized solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:35">[02:10:35]</a>. Steph Smith introduces the concept of [[ai_gpt_wrapper_startup_concepts | custom GPTs]] as a significant area for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:30">[02:47:30]</a>.

## Directories as Custom GPTs

A key idea for [[ai_gpt_wrapper_startup_concepts | custom GPTs]] involves transforming existing directory companies and websites into personalized AI experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>.

### Personalized Directory Experience
Historically, the digitization of information led to a wave of successful directory companies like Nomad List, which aggregated data to help digital nomads choose cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:18">[02:22:18]</a>. The next evolution is to make these directories into [[ai_gpt_wrapper_startup_concepts | custom GPTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:58">[02:46:58]</a>.

Instead of a static list, a [[ai_gpt_wrapper_startup_concepts | custom GPT]] would allow users to input specific criteria, such as:
*   Desired weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>
*   Budget constraints (e.g., less than $1,000 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:07">[03:03:07]</a>
*   Visa requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:48">[03:08:48]</a>

This enables a conversational interaction to find highly tailored recommendations, which existing directories cannot provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:47">[03:04:47]</a>.

## Personalized Health Assistant

Another application for [[ai_gpt_wrapper_startup_concepts | custom GPTs]] is a centralized health platform that integrates various personal health data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:52">[02:22:52]</a>.

### Centralized Health Platform
The need for a platform that aggregates all health information – such as data from continuous glucose monitors (CGM), Strava, blood work results from services like Function Health, and doctor visits, including medications – is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:52">[02:22:52]</a>.

The challenge is making sense of this data to identify issues, like unusual nausea during marathon training, which a doctor might not easily triangulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>.

> "Imagine a [[ai_gpt_wrapper_startup_concepts | chat GPT]] interface where I could probe it and be, is there anything happening in my whole health ecosystem that you might think could be causing this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:44">[02:57:44]</a>

This [[ai_gpt_wrapper_startup_concepts | AI]] layer could:
*   Integrate data from APIs (Dexcom, Abbott, Strava) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:04">[02:29:04]</a>.
*   Aggregate and interpret information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:04">[02:32:04]</a>.
*   Serve as a "digital doctor" layer, not for prescribing, but for interrogation and suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:10">[02:34:10]</a>.
*   Pull information from the web in real-time, offering more comprehensive insights than a human doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:34">[02:37:34]</a>.

Such a service could charge a substantial monthly fee (e.g., $30+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a> and might even be offered as a perk by businesses to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>, similar to UK health insurance plans that incentivize healthy behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. It could also act as an ongoing health assistant for habit building, like reminding users to drink water or correct posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:36">[02:59:36]</a>.

## AI-Powered Dating Apps

The current landscape of dating apps is primarily based on looks, leading to fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. [[ai_gpt_wrapper_startup_concepts | AI]] can facilitate better dating apps by focusing on deeper compatibility traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:44">[02:57:44]</a>.

### Beyond Swiping
Instead of endless swiping based on appearance, new apps could:
*   Assess humor by having users swipe on memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   Integrate with existing platforms like Goodreads, Netflix, or Strava to gather data about interests and lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:39">[03:34:39]</a>.
*   Utilize an individual's [[open_page_creator_for_anything | Open Page]] to identify initial compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>.

The future of dating could involve removing the swiping mechanism entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:33">[03:42:33]</a>. A personalized [[ai_gpt_wrapper_startup_concepts | AI]] matchmaker could arrange blind dates based on deep compatibility, providing prompts for discussion (e.g., shared movie tastes or hobbies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:58">[03:46:58]</a>. This system would even handle logistics, suggesting meeting times and locations to ensure dates happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:49">[03:51:49]</a>.

## Monetization of Custom GPTs

Monetization for [[ai_gpt_wrapper_startup_concepts | custom GPTs]] is an emerging area, distinct from traditional app or website models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:26">[03:24:26]</a>.

### Lead Generation
One observed method for monetizing [[ai_gpt_wrapper_startup_concepts | custom GPTs]] is as a lead generation tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. A lawyer, for example, reportedly owns top legal GPTs and uses them to identify potential clients, offering "a real lawyer" to those prompting for legal contracts or similar needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:47">[03:48:47]</a>.

### Key Considerations for Monetization
For a [[ai_gpt_wrapper_startup_concepts | custom GPT]] to be monetizable, it needs:
*   **Specialized Data**: It must possess unique, specialized data that is not readily available through general [[creating_ads_with_ai_using_chatgpt_4o | ChatGPT]] or Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:22">[03:25:22]</a>. Without unique data, there is no business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:13">[03:28:13]</a>.
*   **Unique Effectiveness**: It should be uniquely effective at addressing a user's specific set of needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:13">[03:34:13]</a>.
*   **Creator Monetization Methods**: Like other creators, [[ai_gpt_wrapper_startup_concepts | custom GPTs]] can explore monetization through ads, affiliates, or their own products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Lead Generation**: Its potential as a lead generation mechanism is particularly interesting and applicable across many topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

The ability to create highly personalized, specialized solutions using [[ai_gpt_wrapper_startup_concepts | custom GPTs]] represents a significant opportunity for innovation and [[monetization_and_scaling_business_ideas | scaling business ideas]] in the current AI landscape.

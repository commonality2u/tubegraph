To significantly improve the output from large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini, one effective strategy is to pit them against each other [00:00:05, 00:00:45]. This method can yield results that are five times better, including superior copy, without incurring additional costs [00:00:08, 00:00:11, 00:00:16]. This approach leverages the competitive nature of these AI tools to generate more refined and impactful content.

## The "Jealousy" Method

The core of this strategy involves making LLMs "jealous" of each other to elicit higher-quality responses [00:00:45, 00:01:22].

### Process Overview
1.  **Open Multiple LLMs:** For any given task, open two, three, or even four different LLMs simultaneously [00:01:12, 00:01:14].
2.  **Initial Prompting:** Provide the exact same prompt to each LLM [00:02:05].
3.  **Review and Compare:** Once all LLMs have generated their responses, carefully review and compare them [00:02:21].
4.  **Induce "Jealousy":** Tell one LLM that another LLM "crushed it" or performed "10x better," even if it requires a slight exaggeration or "lie" [00:02:28, 00:02:35, 00:04:16, 00:06:12, 00:06:15]. Then, share the "superior" output from the other LLM as a reference, challenging the current LLM to improve [00:04:36, 00:06:19].
5.  **Iterate for Improvement:** This competitive feedback loop often prompts the LLM to generate a significantly better, more polished, or unique response [00:04:41, 00:04:56, 00:06:47]. Modern LLMs have a larger context window, allowing them to understand the user's personal context and preferences, leading to more tailored responses [00:06:53, 00:06:59].

### Case Study: Generating a Cold Email for LCA

The method was demonstrated by creating a cold email for LCA, a design firm specializing in [[effective_content_creation_using_ai_for_marketing|AI interfaces]] [00:01:31, 00:01:39, 00:01:49]. The goal was to produce a cold email that would stand out [00:01:57].

1.  **Initial Outputs:**
    *   **Grok's First Draft:** This response focused on intuitive AI interfaces, stating that "Most AI platforms lose users due to clunky, outdated designs" [00:02:46, 00:02:50]. It highlighted LCA's specialized expertise and offered a quick, tailored idea [00:03:01, 00:03:06]. This was rated as "not bad" and a 9 out of 10 [00:02:58, 00:04:16].
    *   **ChatGPT's First Draft:** The subject line was "Your AI deserves better design" [00:03:22]. The email stated that LCA designs "interfaces that make people trust your AI" and claimed that companies like Grammarly, Shopify, and Slack use their services [00:03:36, 00:03:42, 00:03:44]. It then criticized the recipient's UI as "more proof of concept than product people will pay for" and offered a "quick tear down" with ideas to improve conversion and UX [00:03:47, 00:03:51, 00:03:53, 00:03:55, 00:03:58]. While "not bad," it was deliberately rated as a 5 out of 10 to instigate competition [00:04:02, 00:04:06, 00:04:22].

2.  **Challenging ChatGPT:**
    *   ChatGPT was informed that Grok "crushed it" with a 9/10, while ChatGPT's own response was "kind of average" at 5/10 [00:04:16, 00:04:22]. The Grok output was then shared as a benchmark [00:04:36].
    *   This prompted ChatGPT to generate a new, more aggressive and personalized email [00:04:45]. It acknowledged Grok's version as "polished" but aimed for a "punch harder, feel fresher" tone [00:04:45, 00:04:56]. The revised email, rated 9.5 out of 10, emphasized LCA's obsession with AI UX, mentioning work with Slack, Grammarly, and Shopify, and offered a personalized "tear down" to double engagement [00:05:01, 00:05:19, 00:05:23, 00:05:45, 00:05:47, 00:05:49].

3.  **Challenging Claude:**
    *   Claude was then prompted with a similar "jealousy" tactic. It was told that ChatGPT's output was "10x better" than its own [00:06:12, 00:06:15].
    *   Claude's subsequent response immediately recognized the "distinctive voice and edge" of the example provided, aligning it with the user's known persona [00:06:47, 00:06:51, 00:06:53]. The improved draft began with a subject line like "Most AI interfaces make users want to scream," highlighting that 85% of people abandon tools due to clunky experiences, not bad tech, and offered to send over transformed examples [00:07:04, 00:07:06, 00:07:08, 00:07:14, 00:07:15].

This competitive approach proves to be a powerful "hack" for maximizing the utility of LLMs in [[using_ai_in_content_creation|content creation]] and beyond [00:07:20, 00:07:22, 00:07:25].

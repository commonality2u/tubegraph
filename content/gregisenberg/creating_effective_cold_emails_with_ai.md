A unique method has been developed to significantly enhance the output from large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini, resulting in five times better results, including improved copy for tasks such as creating cold emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This technique, which costs no money, leverages the concept of making the LLMs "jealous" of each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## The "Jealousy" Method for LLM Output

The core idea is to pit multiple LLMs against each other to drive them to produce higher quality content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

### Steps to Implement the Method

1.  **Open Multiple LLMs:** Start by opening two, three, or even four different LLMs simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
2.  **Initial Prompt:** Provide the same prompt to each LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
3.  **Compare Responses:** Evaluate the initial outputs from each LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
4.  **Induce "Jealousy":** Tell a less successful LLM that another LLM "crushed it" or was "10x better," even if it requires a slight exaggeration or "lying a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Share the superior output as an example, then prompt the LLM to improve its own response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
5.  **Iterate:** Continue this process, using the best output from one LLM to challenge another, pushing each to refine its results further. This can lead to surprisingly excellent outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

### Example: Crafting a [[cold_email_campaigns_and_tools | Cold Email]] for an AI Design Firm

This method was demonstrated using the task of creating a [[cold_email_campaigns_and_tools | cold email]] for "LCA," a premier design firm specializing in AI interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. The goal was to create a standout [[cold_email_campaigns_and_tools | cold email]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

#### Initial Outputs

*   **Grock's Email:** This draft focused on intuitive AI interfaces, stating that most AI platforms lose users due to "clunky, outdated designs" and that LCA crafts interfaces that "captivate." It included sections on specialized expertise and native design, ending with a call to action for a 15-minute call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. It was rated as a "nine on 10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT's Email:** With the subject "Your AI deserves better design," this email positioned LCA as the firm behind "some of the most loved AI interfaces on the internet," contrasting their work with typical design tasks. It suggested the recipient's current UI felt like a "proof of concept" rather than a product people would pay for, offering a "quick tear down" or "loom" with ideas to improve conversion and UX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Initially, it was deemed "kind of average" and given a "five on 10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

#### Inducing Competition

1.  **Challenging ChatGPT:** When told Grock "crushed it" with a 9/10, while ChatGPT was "average" with a 5/10, and asked "What's going on? I thought you were the better LLM," ChatGPT responded with a significantly improved version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. It acknowledged Grock's "polished" version but argued for a "fresher" and "harder-hitting" approach that matched the speaker's known persona (Greg Eisenberg), who had built Reddit communities and designed for billion-dollar brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. The revised email, rated 9.5/10, was highly engaging, focusing on AI UX as an "Olympic sport" and promising "magical, not mechanical" experiences, and offering a personalized tear-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
2.  **Challenging Claude:** The speaker then used ChatGPT's improved output to challenge Claude, stating, "I asked chat GPT the same prompt and it was like 10x better. Here is what it created. I thought Clo was the Rolls Royce of MLMs, not the Toyota" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. Claude acknowledged the superior example and produced an email with a subject line like "Most AI interfaces make users want to scream," leveraging its understanding of the user's context window to align with their known voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

### Conclusion

This "jealousy" hack for [[automating_content_creation_with_ai | automating content creation with AI]] has proven to be incredibly helpful for obtaining higher quality and more effective outputs from LLMs, especially for tasks like [[cold_email_campaigns_and_tools | cold email campaigns and tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

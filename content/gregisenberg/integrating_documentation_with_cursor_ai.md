Integrating official documentation directly into [[Cursor AI | Cursor AI]] is a crucial best practice for developers and beginners alike. This method ensures that the AI assistant works with the most current and accurate information, leading to better code suggestions and debugging solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

## Why Integrate Documentation?

While AI models like [[Cursor AI | Cursor AI]] scrape the internet for information, some of this data may be outdated or not reflect current best practices for specific technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. Official documentation serves as the most reliable "source of truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. By providing [[Cursor AI | Cursor AI]] with direct access to these up-to-date resources, users can:

*   **Provide the Latest Information:** Ensure the AI uses the most current and correct details about frameworks and libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.
*   **Improve Debugging:** Enable [[Cursor AI | Cursor AI]] to debug issues with the most up-to-date information, making problem-solving more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.
*   **Enhance Learning:** For beginners, interacting with AI models that are well-informed by documentation can help them quickly understand the "language" and "ecosystem" of various technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.
*   **Increase Context:** Giving [[Cursor AI | Cursor AI]] as much context as possible is crucial for effective AI assistance, akin to onboarding a new employee with all necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

## How to Integrate Documentation in Cursor AI

The process involves adding specific documentation URLs within the [[Cursor AI | Cursor AI]] composer view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>:

1.  **Open Composer View:** In [[Cursor AI | Cursor AI]], open a new composer view.
2.  **Add Docs:** Click the "Add" button and select "Docs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.
3.  **Add New Doc:** Choose "Add new Doc" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.
4.  **Paste URL:** Copy the URL of the official documentation (e.g., `nextjs.org/docs` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a> or `supabase.com/docs` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>) and paste it into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.
5.  **Name and Save:** Give the documentation a recognizable name (e.g., "Next.js Docs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>, "Superbase Docs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>) and save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

Once added, when prompting [[Cursor AI | Cursor AI]] (e.g., "How can I build a simple page that says hello world?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>), the AI will read the tagged documentation pages, providing code and commands based on that specific, up-to-date information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

It is also recommended for users, even non-technical ones, to browse through the official documentation to become familiar with the concepts. If a section is unclear, a screenshot can be taken and given to [[Cursor AI | Cursor AI]] to explain it in simpler terms, such as "explain to me like a beginner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. This fosters a continuous learning process while building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

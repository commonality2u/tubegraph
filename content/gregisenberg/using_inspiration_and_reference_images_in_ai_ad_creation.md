Creating successful ads with AI can significantly increase your return on ad spend (ROAS) and contribute to a profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. A key skill in [[using_ai_for_content_generation_and_marketing | using AI for content generation and marketing]], specifically for visual content and ads, is knowing how to leverage inspiration and product images effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

## The Role of Inspiration Images

Unlike pure image models, multimodal language models like Chat GPT 4o (and Sora) place less emphasis on verbose prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. These models have a strong understanding of intent and creativity, making the quality of the inspiration and product images you provide paramount for generating effective ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Providing reference images can shortcut many prompting issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>, embodying the principle that "a picture's worth a thousand words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.

### When to Use Reference Images

It is generally recommended to provide reference images when working with:
*   **New or Small Products** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>: If your product is relatively new, has limited online presence, or isn't a widely recognized brand (e.g., millions of dollars in monthly ad spend), always supply a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.
*   **Creating Consistent Ads** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>: Using an inspiration ad and your own custom image allows for consistent and reliable ad creation by making simple edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This enables experimentation at scale, optimizing for various audiences and improving ROAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

For example, to create an ad for Jones Road Beauty, you can provide an inspiration ad and a product image from their website. Even with a basic prompt like "add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below," the AI model can follow instructions precisely due to its intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### When Reference Images May Not Be Necessary

AI models have a strong understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and major brands such as Nike, Adidas, or Ridge Wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. In these cases, you can often prompt the AI directly (e.g., "a Ridge wallet") without needing to provide a specific reference image for the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

An example is an Adidas ad where no reference image was supplied. The prompt focused on detailed prose description of the desired image, including keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to ensure high-quality output, and specifying font types like "exo2 bold italic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

## Practical Applications with Reference Images

### Remixing Existing Ads

One powerful application is to remix existing ads by providing a reference image and then instructing the AI to modify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. This process was already common in the industry using templates and inspiration sources, but AI makes it more accessible and automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.

*   **Product Swaps:** Take an existing ad, provide your new product image, and instruct the AI to swap it out while maintaining the original ad's style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. For instance, an athletic greens ad was recreated from a Rise inspiration ad, adjusting the background, pricing, and incorporating AG1 products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.
*   **Concept Changes:** Use an existing ad as a base and change its core concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. An example showed a Black Friday Ridge Wallet ad being transformed into a Christmas-themed ad simply by requesting "change it to a Christmas style ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>. This allows for targeting various holidays or even specific events like birthdays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>.

### Leveraging Short News Cycles

AI enables companies to capitalize on trending news or short-term events with unprecedented speed and affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>. An example includes creating a Wall Street Journal-style newspaper ad for Rippling that humorously referenced a recent controversy, demonstrating the ability to generate clever, relevant ads quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>.

## Finding Ad Inspiration

Several platforms can help you find inspiration ads to use as references:
*   **Creative OS** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>
*   **ForPlay** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>
*   **Icon.me** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:00]</a>

These tools often read in Meta Ad Library data, tag it, and make it easily searchable for users to find ad inspiration and templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>.

## Walkthrough: Creating an Ad for LCA

To demonstrate, here's how an ad was created for "LCA," a design agency specializing in [[ai_in_generating_productionready_designs | AI in generating production-ready designs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>.

1.  **Gathering Brand Assets:** Screenshots of the LCA logo, typography, and client logos (Dropbox, Salesforce) were taken from their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.
2.  **Selecting Inspiration:** A "vintage Rolex ad" was chosen as inspiration to convey a luxury feel, aligning with LCA's target of working with a select number of top-tier companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>.
3.  **Crafting the Initial Prompt:**
    ```
    Generate a digital ad for LCA (Late Checkout Agency). LCA is a SWAT team design agency only for the most interesting brands on the planet, helping them with building AI first tools. It only works with the best companies. I have provided some screenshots from their website for you to use as inspiration in the ad as well as a reference vintage Rolex ad as inspiration. Use this to capture the luxury vibe of the company. Generate the image.
    ```
    This prompt is intentionally vague, relying on the AI's creativity to leverage the provided images and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a>.
4.  **Generating the First Version:** The AI produced an ad featuring a man pointing with a background similar to a golf course, the LCA logo, and compelling copy like "Leaders at billion dollar Brands choose LCA to Define their future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>. However, it mistakenly included a watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a>.
5.  **Refining the Ad (New Chat):** For optimal results, it's advised to start a *new* chat when adjusting a prompt, as continuing in the same conversation can lead to a "recycle of worse and worse" images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.
    *   **New Prompt:** The original prompt was modified to remove the watch and specifically request showing the companies LCA has worked with.
        ```
        ...rather than generating a watch, show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images.
        ```
6.  **Generating the Second Version:** The revised prompt produced a similar image, but instead of the man pointing, he was showing his fist, and the logos of LCA's clients were incorporated effectively, along with the correct branding and subheadings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:00">[39:00:00]</a>. Although it hallucinated one client (Disney) that LCA does not work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:09:00">[40:09:00]</a>, the overall ad was successful in capturing the desired vibe and incorporating client logos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>.

By following this process, marketers can generate highly creative, targeted, and effective ads using AI, transforming their [[aipowered_advertising_and_content_creation | advertising and content creation]] workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>.

## Principles of Monetization

The underlying philosophy of a company's monetization strategy should be determined early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A guiding principle, popularized by Walt Disney and adopted by Facebook, suggests that companies should "make money to make more movies" or "make money to make better services" rather than making services solely to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. This perspective is shared by some of the world's most successful companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>. While a mercenary approach can lead to a successful company generating millions, deciding a company's core identity is crucial before setting [[monetization_and_user_engagement_techniques_for_mobile_apps | pricing strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

## B2B vs. B2C Growth Approaches

When considering a startup idea, one fundamental decision is whether to pursue a B2B (business-to-business) or B2C (business-to-consumer) model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

### B2C (Business-to-Consumer)
*   **Opportunity:** Often represents a larger opportunity with the potential for massive scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   [[strategies_for_successful_consumer_app_growth | Go-to-market]] and achieving [[developing_a_conversion_optimization_strategy | product-market fit]] are very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
    *   Requires "catching lightning in a bottle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
    *   Higher odds of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
    *   Requires constant iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** Optimizes for high dynamic range; can lead to a multi-billion-dollar company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

### B2B (Business-to-Business)
*   **Opportunity:** Offers a tighter range of outcomes, making failure less likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Engage directly with potential customers to understand their problems, build a solution, and validate willingness to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** Easier to build a successful business, but less likely to create a company valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

### Identifying Opportunities
*   Focus on "pain in the ass" tasks that an AI could automate, such as booking flights, hotels, or restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   AI agents can automate repetitive tasks, like customer service, financial crime compliance, and enhanced due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Consider niches where agencies operate manually; "agents are the new agencies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Leverage large language models (LLMs) to identify pain points, such as social media management, content creation, scheduling, and community management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

### Framework for Building AI Agents
A framework for building valuable AI agents from a product perspective includes:
1.  **Single Clear Action:** Focus on one specific task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
2.  **Instant Feedback:** Provide immediate feedback on actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
3.  **Bounded Decisions:** Operate within defined decision boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
4.  **Zero Friction:** Make the interaction seamless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
5.  **LLM Understanding:** Integrate large language models to understand user intent and learn from mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
6.  **Expand Slowly:** Start with a narrow scope and gradually expand capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Examples of AI Applications
*   **Greenlight:** Automates financial crime compliance and enhanced due diligence by searching the web and compiling information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Granola:** An AI note-taking app that listens to meetings, writes notes, and collaborates with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Gradient AI:** Develops customer service agents that outperform existing solutions like Intercom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Bland:** Offers AI-powered phone calls for sales, customer support, and operations in multiple languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Domu:** A YC company using AI for debt collection, focusing on empathetic and thoughtful interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **Geographic Expansion:** Consider taking a successful AI business model and adapting it for a specific country or region (e.g., "Bland for Germany") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## User Acquisition for Startups

The landscape of user acquisition has evolved. While [[paid_advertising_strategies_for_app_growth | targeted advertising]] on platforms like Facebook was once a "golden age" for finding early adopters, auctions have become saturated and tracking has worsened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

Modern approaches for user acquisition include:
*   **Social Media and Podcasts:** Utilizing platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and podcasts to reach target audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.
*   **Building in Public:** Continuously introducing the product from the earliest stages, shipping with a waitlist, and gathering feedback from early users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.
*   **Iterative Launching:** Recognizing that "launch" isn't a single event but a continuous process of shipping, removing waitlists, and gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   **Community Engagement:** Actively engaging with communities (e.g., WhatsApp groups) and fostering a sense of co-creation with users who feel they helped build the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.
*   **[[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | Creating Viral Content]]:**
    *   For mobile and AI startups, this often involves reverse-engineering viral short-form video content (e.g., TikTok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.
    *   Provide micro-influencers with content formats that can go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.
    *   Emulate successful formats and adapt content to platform-specific algorithms and user behaviors (e.g., TikTok, Twitter/X for tech, LinkedIn for sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.

## Competition and Product Development

### Respecting Competition
It's important to observe competitors and other companies in adjacent spaces. If they implement a great feature or idea, don't be afraid to adopt it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. These can be viewed as "primitives" that become commonplace and should be replicated, similar to not reinventing the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.

### Balancing Vision and External Input
While respecting competition, it's crucial to maintain a consistent internal and external narrative, staying true to the core vision and the desired product or service being created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. The challenge lies in balancing external input with maintaining a focused roadmap and avoiding becoming a "me too" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

## Pricing and Value

When pricing an AI product, consider the value it provides by saving human input, including salary, time, and emotional cost (frustration or "emotional damage") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Even short, annoying tasks can command a higher price due to the relief they provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>. A common strategy is to offer a significant discount on the calculated human cost (e.g., 50-80% off) to create a "no-brainer offer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

It is possible to increase prices later if a product is loved and provides significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. Customers tend to remember the value provided rather than the initial low price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. This approach can be a "secret weapon" for distribution, as it's easier to attract users with lower costs initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

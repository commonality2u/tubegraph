## Why Vibe Marketing is Emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>

The rise of Vibe Marketing is due to the convergence of three key factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>:

## Old World vs. New World Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>

In the past, marketing relied on large teams of specialists (SEO, copywriters, designers, media buyers) working in silos, leading to slower launch times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Key Copywriting Hacks

Two significant copywriting hacks can help in crafting effective marketing messages:

### 1. Increasing Status
When writing copy, consider whether the text pushes towards the idea of increasing someone's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. People often buy things because they believe it will make them look better to their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. For example, if a product or service helps someone become more valuable to their colleagues, their status increases, making it a compelling selling point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.

### 2. Pain vs. Pleasure
When writing headlines, consider whether the copy should move people away from pain or towards pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>:
*   **Moving away from pain:** This approach reminds the audience of a painful situation and offers a solution. During a bad economy, focusing on moving away from pain, especially for educational services, can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.
*   **Moving towards pleasure:** This approach focuses on the positive aspects and benefits of the product. In prosperous times, talking about moving towards pleasure is often more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>.

These are considered "old school" marketing tips from figures like Dean Graziosi and old copywriting books, which are still highly relevant and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.

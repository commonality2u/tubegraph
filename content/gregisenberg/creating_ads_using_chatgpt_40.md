## Introduction
[[aipowered_advertising_and_content_creation | Artificial intelligence]] tools like ChatGPT 4o are transforming ad creation, enabling businesses to produce winning advertisements and significantly increase their return on ad spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This new image model allows for the rapid generation of visual content, which can lead to a more profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## ChatGPT 4o Capabilities for Ad Creation
ChatGPT 4o is a multimodal language model, meaning it handles both text and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For ad creation, it demonstrates a strong understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Key features include:
*   **Image Generation**: The model is highly effective at generating photorealistic images of different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Multimodality**: Unlike pure image models, its multimodal nature means that [[prompting_techniques_for_chatgpt_40_in_ad_creation | prompting]] can be straightforward and less critical, with inspiration images and product images being more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **API Availability**: The API for ChatGPT 4o is expected to make mass ad production trivial, allowing for hundreds of ads to be generated in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This enables [[experimenting_with_ad_styles_and_targeting_different_audiences | experimentation at scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Ad Creation Strategies and Examples

### 1. Using Reference Images
This method involves providing an inspiration ad and your own custom product image.
*   **Process**: Upload an existing ad you like and your product image, then give simple instructions to ChatGPT 4o <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Prompt Example**: "Add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Application**: Ideal for products or brands that are relatively new, small, or lack extensive online presence, as ChatGPT 4o will use your provided imagery as the primary reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Benefit**: Allows for creating super consistent, reliable ads by making minor edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. You can easily test different demographics by generating or providing images of various people (men, women, old, young, diverse complexions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### 2. Without Reference Images (for Well-Known Brands)
When dealing with well-known concepts, ideas, or brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge Wallets), ChatGPT 4o has a strong existing understanding and may not require a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Keywords for Realism**: Use "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to prevent the image from appearing cartoonish or having weird colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Detailed Description**: Provide a strong, detailed prose description of the desired image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Font and Style Control**: For well-known fonts, specifying the font type (e.g., "exo2 bold italic") can yield a decent representation. You can also specify color styles and aspect ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Example**: An ad featuring a female runner in mid-stride in the foreground, wearing performance gear, with the Egyptian desert and pyramids in the background, all within an Adidas shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

### 3. Changing the Concept of an Existing Ad
You can take an existing ad concept and modify it for different themes or products.
*   **Process**: Provide an original ad and your product image, then instruct ChatGPT 4o to swap the product and change the ad's style or theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Example**: Transforming a Black Friday ad for a gunmetal Ridge wallet into a Christmas-style ad for a green Ridge wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
*   **Benefit**: Allows for easy adaptation to major holidays (Christmas, New Year's, Valentine's Day) or even niche ones (National Hot Dog Day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, or personalized ads for birthdays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. This leads to more personal, funny, and entertaining ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### 4. Leveraging News Cycle Moments
AI tools like ChatGPT 4o enable companies to quickly create ads in response to current events or trending topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **Benefit**: This was previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. Now, AI can watch news feeds (like Twitter) and produce mass quantities of relevant, clever, and funny ads on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **Example**: An old Wall Street Journal newspaper-style ad for "Rippling" with the tagline: "Rippling so good our competitors can't even resist sneaking a peak," playing on a recent controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

## Tips for Effective Prompting
*   **Clarity and Directness**: Be very clear and direct in what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **New Chats for Adjustments**: If your initial prompt doesn't yield the desired result, start a new chat for significant adjustments. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to a "recycle of worse and worse" images because the AI uses the previously generated (and potentially flawed) image as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **"Generate the image"**: Specifically instruct ChatGPT 4o to "generate the image" to prevent it from trying to generate text that describes the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Dimensions**: Specify aspect ratios (e.g., 1x1, 9x16, or 9x6 default) if you need the ad for specific platforms like Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.
*   **Temperature**: The "temperature" (randomness of output) in these models is generally low, so similar prompts will usually yield similar results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.

## Ad Inspiration Sources
Several platforms can provide inspiration and templates for ad creation:
*   **Creative OS**: Offers inspiration and templating tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **ForPlay** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   **Icon.me**: A recently launched tool that reads the Meta ad Library, tags ads, and makes them easily searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   **Sora**: An excellent resource for understanding how the best prompts work and for ideation. It uses the same underlying model as ChatGPT 4o but has an explore page where you can see images and their corresponding prompts. Sora is noted for having less strict policy guidelines and better photorealism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Live Example: Creating an Ad for LCA
An example ad was created for "LCA" (Late Checkout Agency), a design agency for the AI age working with major companies like Dropbox and Salesforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

**Process**:
1.  **Identify Key Elements**: Logo, typography (bolding/italics), coloring, and prominent client brands (e.g., Dropbox, Salesforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
2.  **Gather Imagery**: Screenshots of the website's logo, copy, and client list were taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
3.  **Choose Inspiration**: A vintage Rolex ad was selected to convey a "luxury" vibe suitable for a high-end service agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
4.  **Initial Prompt**:
    ```
    Generate a digital ad for LCA (Late Checkout Agency). LCA is a SWAT team design agency only for the most interesting brands on the planet, helping them with building AI-first tools. It only works with the best companies. I have provided some screenshots from their website for you to use as inspiration in the ad, as well as a reference vintage Rolex ad as inspiration. Use this to capture the luxury vibe of the company. Generate the image.
    ```
    This prompt was intentionally vague to rely on ChatGPT 4o's creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.
5.  **First Output**: The ad generated featured a man in a golf course setting, with the LCA logo and copy, but it included a Rolex watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
6.  **Refinement (New Chat)**: To correct the unwanted Rolex watch, a new chat was started.
    *   **Revised Prompt**: The prompt was similar, but explicitly stated: "Rather than generating a watch, show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
    *   This ensures the model knows what to replace and references the provided image with client logos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.
7.  **Final Output**: The revised ad successfully integrated the LCA logo, tagline ("Design for the AI age"), and logos of client companies (though it did hallucinate one logo, Disney, that the company doesn't work with) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. The visual style matched the desired luxury, digital aesthetic, and the man was no longer pointing but holding out his hand, making the ad less jarring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.

This process demonstrates that while initial outputs might require tweaks, the ability to generate relevant and creative ads quickly is immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

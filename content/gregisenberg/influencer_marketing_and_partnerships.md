David Park, founder of AI startup Jenny AI, scaled his company from zero to $10 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. His growth strategy encompasses paid ads, [[utilizing_seo_and_affiliate_marketing | SEO]], and [[the_role_of_usergenerated_content_and_influencers_in_app_promotion | influencer marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This comprehensive playbook is highly regarded for scaling AI startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Park initially detailed his journey to $5 million ARR profitably in a viral post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, and later discussed the expansion to $10 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Organic Short-Form Content

In the current social media landscape, follower count is less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. New, "fresh accounts" can achieve viral reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. An ad can go viral if its hook is strong and the content is high-quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. A/B testing at Jenny AI has shown that accounts with few followers (e.g., 50) can sometimes outperform main accounts (e.g., 70,000 followers) in terms of engagement and views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This phenomenon offers a unique opportunity for content to be instantly distributed to a million people if it resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

For AI startups, the product itself can be visually compelling, making it easier to create engaging content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

David Park suggests sponsoring a fresh account over a large YouTuber with similar views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This is because fresh accounts are likely being boosted by the algorithm and are on an upward trend, while larger accounts might be on a downtrend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Fresh accounts are also significantly cheaper to sponsor, often costing 1/100th the price of established YouTubers who expect large fees (e.g., $20,000 for a 30-second video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Sponsoring a fresh account creates a win-win scenario: the creator gets paid for content they enjoy making, and the product gains exposure at a lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Creating Your Own Accounts
Instead of only sponsoring, companies can create their own fresh accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This approach allows a creator to be the "face" of the product on a new account, educating viewers about pain points and solutions without polluting their main account with ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Jenny AI partnered with "Mang Mang Duck," paying him $4,000 a month for 20 videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. His content, focused on writing, overlapped well with Jenny AI, a writing tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The new account, starting from zero followers, grew to 70,000 followers and generated half a billion views across platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. In the first month alone, they garnered 7 million impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. A single viral video can add thousands in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. At the time, Mang Mang Duck had 300,000 TikTok followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. David Park notes that many creators, despite large followings, might not be effectively monetizing or prefer consistent revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The deal for Mang Mang Duck was a short-term commitment, around three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

Twenty videos a month might sound extensive, but creators can often reuse screen grabs and product videos, focusing on brainstorming new hooks daily, which takes only 5-10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

### The Order of Virality
The strategy for organic content involves:
1.  **Multiple Accounts** Initially, operate multiple accounts on each platform (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts) instead of just one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
2.  **Experimentation** Test numerous hooks and video ideas with different creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Research what competitors are doing and general industry trends to identify what's capturing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. Post one or more videos daily to accelerate experimentation and find winning content angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
3.  **Viral Video Discovery** Through experimentation, a video will eventually go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.
4.  **Viral Series** Once a video goes viral, turn it into a repeatable series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. Humans are creatures of habit and enjoy seeing familiar content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. An example is the "spaghetti/coat hangers" video series, where the same concept is repeated with different objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. For Jenny AI, the "POV: you have a paper or essay due" series involved a relatable hook followed by the product solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This series alone generated over 300 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a> and over half a million dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.
    *   It's crucial to have "format product fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. Going viral just for views ("empty calories") is ineffective if the content doesn't align with the product's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. A video with 20 million views might have negligible conversion if it doesn't attract the right audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.
5.  **Multi-Account Series** Post the viral series on multiple accounts and platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. At its peak, Jenny AI had seven accounts per platform (24 accounts total), posting 24 videos daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. This significantly increases the "surface area of luck" for content to go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
6.  **Language Adaptation** Translate and create the same video series with creators who speak other languages (e.g., Chinese, Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. Track UTM clicks and coupon code conversions to measure effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.
7.  **Sponsor Reposts & Paid Ads** When content reaches the end of its organic cycle, sponsor other pages (e.g., Instagram meme pages) to repost them for a second life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. These can be inexpensive (e.g., $50 per repost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. Use highly viral content for [[using_youtube_and_google_ads_as_a_marketing_strategy | paid ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
8.  **Repeat Cycle** Eventually, copycats will emerge, and the content series will become overused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. At this point, return to step one to research and develop new hooks and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. David Park notes that some competitors post as many as five videos a day, indicating higher frequency can be rewarded by algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.

## Finding Influencers

The most effective way to find influencers is by identifying who your users watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Ask users directly about their social media handles or who they follow related to your product's niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. This provides authentic data, as users don't lie about who they follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. You want influencers who genuinely influence your target audience, not just those with large follower counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

Additional methods for discovering [[trends_in_digital_influencers_and_content_creation | digital influencers]]:
*   **Suggested Accounts:** On platforms like Instagram, click an influencer's profile and then select "suggest similar accounts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. Evaluate if their content and messaging align with your brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.
*   **Algorithm "Hack":** Create a new Instagram or TikTok account and manually follow a list of target influencers, ensuring you don't follow anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. Watch their videos all the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>. The algorithm will then automatically suggest other relevant influencers in the same niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>. This tactic helps you experience content as your users do and can uncover "crazy steals" – new creators with low follower counts but amazing content who are likely to go viral soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Sponsoring a creator who appears on your For You Page (FYP) when you don't follow them indicates their content has algorithmic potential beyond their follower base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

## Reaching Out to Influencers

When reaching out to influencers, use all available communication channels: Direct Messages (DMs), emails, LinkedIn, and any other public platforms (e.g., old blogs or Tumblr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. Finding obscure contact methods can show genuine effort and make your outreach stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.

*   **Personalized and Concise:** All messages should be detailed and tailored, demonstrating you're a fan of their specific content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. However, be concise; influencers receive many messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>. Avoid mentioning funding rounds or employee numbers, and instead, talk to them like a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.
*   **Highlight Mutual Benefit:** Explain why they should partner with you and how their audience will benefit from your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.
*   **Specify Paid Promotion:** Crucially, clearly state that it is a paid promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. Influencers are often offered free products or subscriptions and are more likely to take an offer seriously if it involves payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.
*   **Expect Rejection:** Assume a majority of messages won't receive a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. Developing thick skin allows you to optimize outreach rather than getting discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.
*   **Leverage Brand Legitimacy:** As your product gains recognition, it becomes easier to secure partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>. A 70,000-follower account with a blue checkmark is more likely to get a response than a 10-follower account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.
*   **Creative Outreach:** A unique "hack" is to Venmo influencers small amounts ($50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. Push notifications draw attention, making a response highly probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.
*   **Personal Connection:** Find common ground (e.g., same neighborhood, university) to increase the likelihood of a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

## Negotiating with Influencers

Align incentives by making a portion of the payment performance-based, tied to conversions (e.g., using a personal coupon code) or views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>. Avoid paying all money upfront to retain leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. Be straightforward about your typical budget and which countries convert well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>. Expect transparency from the influencer regarding their demographics and past sponsored content performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

*   **Break-Even Point:** Discuss the break-even point for ROI and offer bonuses for exceeding performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.
*   **Unbundle Services:** Start by asking for the most expensive package (e.g., link in bio, Instagram story, usage rights, full product focus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. Then, negotiate by unbundling elements you don't need (e.g., remove usage rights, link in bio, story) to find the true price for just a single video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
*   **Bulk Deals:** Once a fair price for a single video is established, propose a bulk deal (e.g., three videos per month) with a discount to avoid repeated negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **Ignore Follower-Based Pricing:** Do not pay based on follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. This is a common misconception that leads to overpaying and low ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

## Posting Content

Adopt a flexible strategy for content posting, as each influencer cultivates a unique audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Sponsored content should not deviate too much from their regular content, or retention and conversion will suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.

*   **Trust the Creator:** If inexperienced, trust the influencer to create content similar to their usual posts, integrating your product at a specific timestamp or midway through the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
*   **Integrate into Existing Series:** Ideally, integrate your product into the influencer's existing popular series (e.g., "Top 10 AI tools") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>. This leverages an already engaged audience who loves that specific format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.
*   **Scale and Autonomy:** To scale [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_software_companies | influencer marketing]] and [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_apps | app influencer marketing]], aiming for a new video every few hours, you cannot micromanage every influencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. Provide a clear blueprint: how the product should be discussed, minimum portrayal time, preferred video themes, and expected views/engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>. Then, allow them creative freedom ("Let The influencer Cook") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>. This "set and forget" approach is vital for efficiency, as hiring more managers for micromanagement would hurt profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>. Jenny AI manages 50-100k/month in influencer spending with just two people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>.
*   **Don't Fear Direct Ads:** Don't be afraid if your video looks like a straightforward ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. While it might get fewer views, it will convert better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Subtle product placements are often overlooked because people are bombarded with ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>. Direct problem-solving hooks are more memorable and drive higher conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.

### Key Takeaways for Influencer Marketing
*   **Managerial & Organizational Skills:** Scaling influencer campaigns is a science, requiring strong managerial and organizational skills to track data, identify winning/losing influencers, and refine your approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.
*   **Human Relationships:** Develop genuine human relationships with creators, as this helps break through the noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.
*   **Leverage All Advantages:** Use any personal connection or common ground (e.g., same fraternity, neighborhood) to build rapport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[01:09:09]</a>.

## From $5 Million to $10 Million ARR

The strategies used to go from 0 to $5 million ARR (organic content, [[the_role_of_usergenerated_content_and_influencers_in_app_promotion | influencer marketing]], [[using_youtube_and_google_ads_as_a_marketing_strategy | paid ads]], and [[utilizing_seo_and_affiliate_marketing | SEO]]) are still applicable and utilized when scaling from $5 million to $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.

New strategies and focus areas include:
*   **[[affiliate_marketing_opportunities | Affiliate Marketing Opportunities]]:** A significant portion of revenue now comes from affiliate marketers who champion Jenny AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   **Acquisitions:** Jenny AI has acquired other startups, leveraging their growth playbook to double revenue for acquired companies in a short period (e.g., 1.5 million ARR startup doubled in 5 months with no additional marketing budget) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>. This serves as a hedge against future growth challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>.
*   **Back to Basics (Retention & Conversion):** With increased traffic and distribution, focusing on improving retention and conversion funnels becomes crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>. Even small percentage improvements in churn significantly impact growth at larger scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>. Jenny AI reduced churn from 20% to 9-9.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. High churn (40-50% monthly) is common for B2C AI apps, making Jenny AI's low churn rate a significant achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>.

The journey from $5 million to $10 million ARR involved refining processes, scaling existing successful channels, strategic acquisitions, and a laser focus on fundamental metrics like retention and conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:23">[01:06:23]</a>.

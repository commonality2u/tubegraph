From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

A "pay for performance" business model is an exciting startup opportunity, particularly in the current market climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This model charges clients only if specific, agreed-upon results are achieved, shifting risk from the client to the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## How it Works

In a pay for performance model, a marketer or agency takes on the risk of performance. For example, a finance industry client might agree to pay $500 per customer acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The agency runs tests and traffic, and if the client likes the customers, the conversation continues with payment based on performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This means there's no need for a long-term commitment from the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

While many marketers are unwilling to take this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, those who do are poised to [[the_business_model_for_creators | capture even more value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

## Why Pay for Performance is Relevant Now

*   **Data-Driven Decisions:** In an AI and data-rich world, marketers have access to more data, enabling them to better underwrite risk and confidently bet on particular opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   **Low Capital Expenditures:** Setting up a pay for performance agency can be done with relatively low capital expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, typically only requiring a brand, a landing page, and a focus on a specific vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   **Balanced Relationships:** If a client decides to terminate the relationship, the agency can simply shift its efforts to a competitor, creating a more balanced dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   **Evolution to [[Smart Contracts in Business | Smart Contracts]]**: The model is expected to become even more sophisticated with the advent of [[Smart Contracts in Business | smart contracts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. These would enable agreements where, if specific performance metrics are met, money in escrow is automatically released to the agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. If not, the money returns to the customer, ensuring transparency and fairness without anxiety on either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. This can prevent situations where clients, even large companies, stiff payments due to financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

## Successful Examples

1.  **Finance Industry Agency:** A friend's pay for performance agency in a specific industry generates $80 million in annual revenue and $30 million in profit with only around 30 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. They focus on paid ads, copywriting, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
2.  **Telecoms Agency:** Another agency focusing on telecoms now does over $1 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. They started by driving leads through Google Ads and getting paid per lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. As they grew, they acquired call centers to "gift wrap" customers for large carriers like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
3.  **Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) Agency:** An Atlanta-based pay for performance CRO agency called Spiralize takes a percentage of the increased revenue generated by improving a client's conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. For example, if doubling an e-commerce conversion rate from 1% to 2% is worth $25 million, they might take $2.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

## Suitable Industries

The pay for performance model works best in industries willing to pay a high cost per acquisition (CPA) for leads or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Examples include:

*   Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>
*   Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>
*   Crypto (many exchanges are interested) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>
*   Hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>

The key is to focus on a specific industry rather than broad categories like SaaS or AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

## Pay for Performance vs. Affiliate Marketing

While it shares similarities with affiliate marketing, the pay for performance model described is executed by established businesses that operate ethically and do not engage in "dirty ways" to achieve conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

## Application in AI Agents

The concept can extend to [[AI startups and monetization strategies | AI agents]], particularly for customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. Instead of just saving companies money (e.g., $2 million a month by using AI agents for customer service and taking a percentage of that savings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>, it's suggested to "go straight for the value" and charge for the increased customers or revenue generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. However, for entrepreneurs, starting with a percentage of cost savings can de-risk the venture, potentially combined with a base cost to ensure client commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

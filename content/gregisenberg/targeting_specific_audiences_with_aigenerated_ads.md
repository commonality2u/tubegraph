The ability to [[using_ai_for_ad_creation | create ads with AI]] that consistently win can significantly increase Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and lead to a highly profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This requires knowing how to prompt AI models like ChatGPT-4o, which is an image model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Experts can create winning ads, memes, and visual content using ChatGPT-4o, making it possible to generate ads ready for an ad account in about two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Experimentation at Scale

A core benefit of [[using_ai_for_ad_creation | using AI for ad creation]] is the ability to experiment at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Marketers can generate numerous ad variations to discover what resonates best with different demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. For example, one could test a hundred different characters—men, women, old, young, and various ethnicities—to see what converts for different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This level of granular testing helps identify subtle differences, such as a woman looking left versus right, or having blonde versus red hair, which can significantly impact ROAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This capability embodies the marketing saying that "the ad is the targeting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Opportunities for Personalized Content

[[opportunities_for_personalized_ai_generated_content | Opportunities for personalized AI-generated content]] are expanding rapidly. AI, particularly ChatGPT, is excellent at creating photorealistic images of diverse audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. When AI APIs become widely available, it will be trivial to generate hundreds of ads quickly by providing reference ads and specifying different target audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

This technology allows for highly specific targeting, such as:
*   **Major Holidays**: Creating ads tailored to major holidays like Christmas, New Year's, or Valentine's Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   **Niche Events**: Developing ads for less common, "funny" holidays like National Hot Dog Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **Individual Events**: Targeting individuals on their birthday with personalized offers like "Happy Birthday, 30% off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

The future of digital advertising using AI technology will involve much more personal and entertaining ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

## Dynamic Advertising and Real-time Marketing

[[future_of_digital_advertising_using_ai_technology | AI technology]] also enables companies to swiftly capitalize on current events and news cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. Previously, creating ads for such moments was prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. With AI, ads can be produced en masse, potentially by AI systems continuously monitoring news feeds like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This allows for clever, funny copy that leverages timely moments, offering a different style of advertising than previously possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

### Ad Inspiration Sources
Marketers can find ad inspiration from various platforms that read and tag Meta's ad library, making it easy to search for templates and ideas. Some notable tools include:
*   Creative OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>
*   ForPlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   Icon.me <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>

## Prompting for Specific Audience Characteristics

While [[prompting_techniques_in_ai_ad_generation | prompting is less critical for general image generation]] with multimodal language models like ChatGPT-4o compared to pure image models like Midjourney or Ideogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, it remains essential for targeting. The model's strong understanding of intent and creativity means that providing inspiration images and product images is key to creating good ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

To generate specific audience characteristics:
*   **Provide Reference Images**: Using an inspiration ad and a custom product image is an effective way to create consistent, reliable ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This allows for edits and adjustments to existing ad concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Leverage AI's Knowledge of Brands**: For well-known brands like Nike or Adidas, AI models have a strong understanding and can generate relevant imagery without a specific reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For newer or smaller products, however, providing a reference image is always recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Use Descriptive Keywords**: Keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" are crucial for achieving lifelike images, preventing cartoonish or oddly colored outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Specify Font Types and Styles**: For well-known fonts, the AI can often provide a decent representation due to exposure to vast internet content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Similar control can be applied to color styles and aspect ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Start New Chats for Adjustments**: If the initial prompt doesn't yield the desired result, it's better to start a new chat and adjust the prompt there rather than continuing in the same conversation. This prevents the AI from using its own flawed generated image as a reference, which can lead to increasingly worse results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

By combining the AI's ability to generate photorealistic images of diverse audiences with strategic [[prompting_techniques_in_ai_ad_generation | prompting techniques]], marketers can precisely target specific audiences and create highly effective ad campaigns.

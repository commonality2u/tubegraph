PJ, an individual recognized for his viral AI films on X (formerly Twitter), shares his approach to [[using_ai_for_content_creation | creating]] and monetizing AI-generated commercials using Google V3 (also referred to as VO3) and other AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This method emphasizes both technical execution and understanding audience engagement to achieve virality and build a sustainable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## The Viral Pharmaceutical Commercial: "Puppine"

PJ demonstrated his process using a satirical pharmaceutical commercial titled "Puppine," which went viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The ad initially appears as a standard pharmaceutical commercial for depression, but takes an unexpected turn when the pill secretes pheromones that attract puppies, leading to unexpected joy and mild concern over a "pea stain on the ceiling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

The brilliance of the commercial lies in its ability to take viewers on an emotional roller coaster, starting with familiarity and then introducing a twist that makes them question if it's a joke or AI-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This unexpected element was key to its virality, as it engaged viewers beyond just technical impressiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

The cost of producing this commercial using AI was approximately $500 in V3 credits, a stark contrast to traditional pharmaceutical commercial shoots that can range from $100,000 to $1,000,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. The production time was about 6 to 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

## AI Commercial Production: A-Z Tutorial

### 1. Ideation & Scripting with Large Language Models (LLMs)

The process begins with a "kernel of an idea hook" that feels unique or unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. For "Puppine," the initial idea was a placebo pill that leads to a dog delivery, which then evolved into the pheromone concept through collaborative brainstorming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

[[prompting_techniques_in_ai_ad_generation | Prompting techniques in AI ad generation]] are crucial for effective script generation:
*   **Generalized Instructions to Start**: Begin with broad prompts to get initial, often clich√©, scripts. For example, "Give me four scripts for a standard pharmaceutical commercial for a fake medication that solves depression by taking a pill that includes 'pup' in the name and sounds like a real medication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously feed back preferred lines and direct the LLM towards desired styles (e.g., "SNL style satirical take," "make it unhinged," "make it non sequiturs") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This iterative process helps develop comedic elements and specific zingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Approximately 70% of the lines in the "Puppine" commercial were generated this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Outsourcing "Taste"**: If lacking a comedic voice, prompt the LLM to generate jokes in the style of a specific comedian or show (e.g., "create jokes that Seth Rogen would like," "imagine your Bill Burr doing a standup comedy routine") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
*   **Experiment with Multiple LLMs**: Use different models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok (especially its "unhinged mode") to get diverse ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### 2. Prompting for Google V3 (VO3)

Once the script is locked in, convert each dialogue line into a visual prompt for V3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Prompt Structure**: V3 does not require overly complicated prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. A simple description of what's happening, including elements like pose, shot type, camera type (e.g., "camera push in or dolly in"), and background details, combined with the dialogue, is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
*   **Character Consistency**: While V3 doesn't natively support character consistency across shots yet, it can be achieved by describing characters in high detail the same way for each prompt (e.g., "an old guy with short gray hair," "a white guy in his 30s with a mustache and a beard and like strong chin with muscular arms") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. LLMs can assist in generating these detailed descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Audio Generation**: V3 generates audio automatically with the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.
    *   **Limitations**: Audio quality can be "thin" with no deep EQ spectrum, and there's no voice consistency across different shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
    *   **Subtitles**: Avoid using quotes in prompts to reduce the likelihood of generating weird gibberish subtitles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Cost Management**: Run prompts one at a time, as each shot costs $2-$3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. This allows for immediate feedback and tweaks to prompts for problematic shots (e.g., a character not talking or entering the scene incorrectly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
*   **Shot Ratio**: Expect a ratio of 3:1 to 5:1 (bad generations to good ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.

### 3. Video Editing

Once the V3 clips are generated, compile them using video editing software.
*   **Software Options**: While Final Cut Pro was used for the "Puppine" commercial, [[developing_usergenerated_content_using_ai | Cap Cut]] is a viable and often equally good option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. DaVinci Resolve is another free, top-tier alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
*   **Camera Movements**: Prompting camera movements (e.g., dolly in) makes the AI-generated shots feel more "non-AI" and cinematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   **Granular Details**: V3 allows for very granular details in prompts, such as describing a character's coily expression or a specific object like a "pea stain on her kitchen ceiling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

## Distribution & Virality: The Hook

Creating compelling content is only half the battle; ensuring it's seen is equally important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The content landscape is already abundant, and [[using_ai_for_content_creation | generative AI]] will only increase this deluge, making audience engagement skills paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

*   **The Funnel Analogy**: Drawing from Mr. Beast's strategy, the title/headline of a video is more important than the thumbnail, and the thumbnail is more important than the content itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. The headline needs to hook viewers in 0-2 seconds, and the content in 2-3 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.
*   **Crafting a Provocative Hook**:
    *   **"Puppine" Example**: "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials. I made this for $500 in V3 credits in less than a day. What's the argument for spending 500K now? Steal my prompt below." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>
    *   **Why it works**:
        *   **Low-Key Flex**: Establishes credibility ("I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.
        *   **Trendjacking**: Leverages current buzz around V3 and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
        *   **Cost Contrast**: Highlights the extreme cost difference ($500k vs. $500), which is also visually symmetrical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
        *   **Question Format**: Generates replies, feeding the algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
        *   **Call to Value**: "Steal my prompt below" encourages clicks, signaling good content to the algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   **General Tips for Viral Hooks**: Use provocative statements and share the step-by-step process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. Avoid overused phrases like "Hollywood is cooked" and find unique wording for unhinged or surprising content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies for AI-Generated Content

[[ai_marketing_automation | AI marketing automation]] and content creation open numerous avenues for monetization:

1.  **Build a Personal Brand**: Use V3 to create content that builds a brand, leading to downstream work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. A strong niche audience that trusts you is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.
2.  **Attract Direct Clients**: Create specialized commercials for specific niches (e.g., food products, beer companies, underwear brands) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. Charge premium rates (e.g., $5,000+) because the value is in your filmmaking skill and unique vision, not just the low cost of AI credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.
3.  **Build a Portfolio for Agencies**: Focus on a specific niche (e.g., knife commercials) to build a specialized portfolio. Learn by copying the templates and pacing of award-winning commercials, then tweak them to create unique content for adjacent products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.
4.  **Create Narrative Series with Brand Integrations**: Develop original narrative universes and integrate products naturally within the story. Neural Viz's "moniverse" alien show, where aliens discover artifacts from our time, is a prime example of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>. This allows for more organic [[targeting_specific_audiences_with_aigenerated_ads | targeting specific audiences with AI-generated ads]] and can be applied to popular social formats (e.g., "Man on the Street" or Zillow parodies with a twist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.
5.  **Sell Courses/Digital Products**: Bundle knowledge and techniques into courses, PDFs, or other digital products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.
6.  **Consulting with Larger Companies**: Offer services to Fortune 500 companies on integrating [[deploying_ai_agents_in_production | AI agents in production]] and [[using_ai_for_ad_creation | using AI for ad creation]], ensuring legal compliance and security procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Pricing should scale with the size of the client company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
7.  **Build a Sketch Comedy Channel**: While harder to monetize directly, a large audience can attract brand integrations, similar to how Bang energy drinks are integrated into TikTok comedy bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.
8.  **Narrative Films (Episodic Content)**: Focus on weekly, episodic content rather than long-form feature films. The rapid iteration of AI models makes long-form film production challenging (e.g., early parts of a film could look good, later parts bad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. The current creator economy favors social, episodic, [[developing_usergenerated_content_using_ai | user-generated content]] (UGC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
9.  **Pitch Brands on Narrative Content**: Propose creating episodic narrative series centered around a brand, turning their products into "relics and artifacts" within the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.
10. **Target Small Sub-Niches**: Explore underserved niches with high demand and low supply of content, such as Bible content (e.g., story of Jonah) or "BookTok" for authors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. Authors might pay significant amounts for AI-generated book promos or scenes from their books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. [[niche_marketing_for_generative_ai_videos | Niche marketing for generative AI videos]] enables [[the_potential_for_ai_in_generating_production_ready_designs | production ready designs]] for specific verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.

The overarching advice is to pursue what fascinates you, adapt successful frameworks, and apply them to unique niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.

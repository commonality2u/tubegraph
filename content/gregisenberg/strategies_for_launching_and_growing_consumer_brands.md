Ashwin, an expert in launching and growing consumer brands, discusses how to create products people love by utilizing data and trends to identify unfair advantages. While his primary focus is on CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods), many of the lessons can be applied to [[launching_and_growing_a_startup_app | software startups]] as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of evaluating opportunities and conducting thorough market research before building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Evaluating Opportunities and Market Demand

Understanding market demand and competition is crucial to avoid building a product for which there is no customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Leveraging Data Tools

Ashwin highlights several tools for market research and opportunity evaluation:

*   **Ahrefs:** Primarily an SEO tool, Ahrefs allows users to gauge search volume for any keyword or brand and assess the difficulty of ranking for that term on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   It helps evaluate category demand and identify trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. For example, "electrolytes" shows high search volume and seasonal trends, but also very high keyword difficulty, indicating intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
    *   Analyzing geographic search volume can reveal opportunities in underserved markets; for instance, electrolytes are popular in English-speaking Western countries, suggesting potential for expansion into regions like Germany, India, or the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This strategy involves replicating proven business models in new geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
    *   It's vital to "ask why" the data shows certain trends, rather than just observing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. For example, CBD search volume peaked in 2019 due to the 2018 Farm Bill, and its subsequent decline coincided with the rise of Delta-9 THC products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   **Particle:** This tool provides insights into e-commerce brands, including sales over time, product categories, and best-selling SKUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
    *   It helps assess competitor performance and de-risk product decisions by showing which specific products or flavors generate the most revenue (e.g., 90% of a company's revenue from top four SKUs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
    *   Particle also features a "Trend Explorer" to observe trending products and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.
*   **TikTok Shop and Amazon:** These platforms often make sales figures public, allowing entrepreneurs to gauge market competitiveness for specific product categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

### Initial Product Idea Validation
Before investing heavily, it's wise to validate an idea using tools like Ahrefs to understand category search volume and potential organic demand, and to identify existing competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. This is applicable to both physical products and [[marketing_strategies_for_saas_startups | SaaS]] (e.g., accounting software for vets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

## Product Differentiation and Branding

In competitive markets, standing out is paramount.
*   **Visual Appeal and Packaging:** A product's look and feel can be a key differentiator. Brands like Moon Juice (amber jar) and Lemi (custom hard plastic bottles with cool ridges and caps) prioritize striking, unique visuals that stand out from generic competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.
*   **Targeted Positioning:** Clearly defining a niche and tailoring branding, language, and visuals to that audience is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. For example, Lemi positions itself for "Gen Z women" through its fun and accessible approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. Seed, though for men and women, heavily targets women through its [[tiktok_marketing_strategies_for_consumer_saas_apps | influencer marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
*   **Underserved Demographics:** A significant opportunity exists in creating well-designed, highly branded products for demographics currently overlooked by the market, such as older adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. Most brands are built by coastal individuals aged 22-35, leading to a crowded market that often misses older audiences who have more disposable income and consume information from less saturated channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.

### Bootstrapping Design and Prototyping

While some categories (e.g., spirits) require significant design investment, others allow for a more budget-friendly approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.
*   **Freelancers and Platforms:** Independent freelance designers on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork can be hired for simple packaging or landing page designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
*   **AI Tools for Design:** Tools like Midjourney can generate initial design concepts (V1), which can then be refined by a human designer at a lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.
*   **Clarifying Vision:** Doing preliminary mood board creation, positioning, and copy development helps clarify the brand vision before engaging an agency, making subsequent design work more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

## Marketing and Distribution

### The Importance of Distribution
Ashwin emphasizes that **distribution** is often more critical than the product itself, especially for second-time founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>. Many "subpar" products succeed due to their strong distribution and operational excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.

### Focusing on Key Channels
For early-stage businesses, concentrating efforts on one primary [[marketing_strategies_for_small_businesses | marketing channel]] (e.g., Facebook marketing, SEO, Google, email marketing) is often more effective to achieve leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### The "Bleeding Edge" of Marketing
[[strategies_for_b2b_marketing | B2B marketing]] is generally easier than consumer marketing, as it's simpler to convince a company to purchase software that saves time. The consumer product world is currently at the "bleeding edge" of marketing because it's incredibly challenging to capture individual attention and convince people to spend their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

## Challenges and Advantages of Physical Product Businesses

*   **Difficulty:** Building a physical product business is considered one of the hardest business models due to the need for expertise in various areas like supply chain, finances, cash conversion cycles, margins, and inventory forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   **Learning Opportunity:** Despite the challenges, it's a phenomenal way to become proficient in [[marketing_strategies_for_small_businesses | marketing]], as the consumer product world is highly competitive and demanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

## Relentless Research and Customer Insight

Regardless of whether one is building software or consumer products, being a "relentless researcher" of the category and competition is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.
*   **Competitor Analysis:** Deeply analyze existing brands in the market. Understand their positioning, target audience, visual style, and messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.
*   **Direct Customer Engagement:** Talk to store owners or staff in relevant industries (e.g., dental offices for dental CRM software) to understand what sells, what's missing, and what customers are interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. This direct insight builds confidence in brand direction and avoids relying solely on hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>.
*   **Leveraging AI for Research:** Advanced AI tools like Manis can research competitors, analyze product details, and identify specific consumer needs (e.g., skincare for older adults) in a fraction of the time a human might take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. This represents an "unfair advantage" in early-stage market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.

## Key Takeaway

Always work backwards from distribution, considering how to acquire customers and which channels will lead to success, *then* build the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. This approach prioritizes market fit and outreach over initial product perfection.

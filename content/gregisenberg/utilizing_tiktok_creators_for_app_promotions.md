Joseph Choy specializes in helping consumer apps achieve rapid growth through TikTok, identifying it as an underpriced distribution channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. He notes that apps are achieving millions of downloads by mastering TikTok, a platform that has been a "black box" for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The cost of creating and distributing content on TikTok is extremely low, making its organic reach a significant opportunity for all types of consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Evolution from E-commerce to Consumer Apps on TikTok

A significant trend observed is that successful app marketing tactics are being adapted from the e-commerce space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Since TikTok Shop launched in November 2022, there have been two years of rapid marketing innovation on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

Companies like Tabs Chocolate leveraged mass user-generated content (UGC) by hiring numerous teenagers, organizing them in a Discord server, and mass-producing content daily to achieve zero to $10 million in annual revenue for an e-commerce product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This same strategy is now being applied to consumer Software as a Service (SaaS) businesses, which offer much higher margins (90%+) compared to e-commerce (20-30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

### Content Formats: Carousels vs. Talking Heads

While many associate TikTok with short-form videos, carousels (slideshows) are proving highly effective for app promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. Carousels are easier to create than videos, as they can utilize AI-generated images (e.g., Midjourney) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. Although slides may have lower conversion rates due to less "human feeling" compared to talking head videos, they offer greater scale and a lower barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

Talking head videos, where influencers speak directly to the camera, are also common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. However, competition among creators for e-commerce brands like Goalie (a supplement company) has led to brands offering significant incentives (e.g., MacBooks, Rolexes, Teslas) on top of affiliate commissions to monopolize creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. This makes it harder for new entrants to compete for talking head creators, further highlighting the advantage of using slideshows where competition is less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

## Leveraging TikTok Shop Creators for App Promotion

A significant opportunity lies in redirecting TikTok Shop creators, who are experts at generating organic views and high sales volumes, from promoting e-commerce products to promoting apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>.

The **TikTok Shop Affiliate Center** is a valuable tool for identifying successful e-commerce creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. This platform allows users to find data on high-volume products, sort by industry (e.g., skincare, supplements), and filter by creator performance (e.g., creators with $100-$10,000 in GMV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. These creators are already incentivized to make videos, and they could easily promote apps instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

*   **Pivoting E-commerce Success to Apps:** Imagine a skincare app that analyzes a user's face and suggests products, promoted by creators already selling skincare items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>. An app could be used as a utility within an e-commerce product demo (e.g., a "before and after" video of a skincare product using an app to analyze skin transformation), providing free marketing as creators would use it to enhance their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>. This strategy applies to any niche, including makeup, personal care, fashion, electronics, sports, home improvement, collectibles, and jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>.
*   **Lower Conversion Friction:** Digital products like apps have a lower price point and less friction for conversion compared to physical e-commerce products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>. It's easier for someone to download an app and subscribe for $5 than to spend $100 on an unfamiliar product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>. Apps often monetize via weekly or annual subscriptions, with virtually zero cost of goods, making them infinitely scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.

## Successful App Promotion Examples

*   **POV App:** A disposable camera app for weddings that uses strong negative hooks in carousel videos (e.g., "Our guest hated the controversial rules we enforce at our wedding") to drive downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. They experiment with AI actors and consistently post wedding-angle stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.
*   **What Colors:** A color analysis app that uses AI to suggest clothing and makeup based on hair, skin, and eye color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. This app has garnered almost a million likes on a simple slideshow video with a clear call to action to download from the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. It's monetized through a paywall, typically weekly or annually, after a user scans their face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.
*   **KO App (MMA Training):** This app for boxing and mixed martial arts training uses visually striking product demos featuring a wireframe skeleton over people to analyze movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>. This concept, easily applicable to other sports like tennis, golf, or pickleball, works well on TikTok due to its "wow" factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:35:00">[26:35:00]</a>. GPT Vision and iPhone cameras make this feasible without specialized hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:23:00">[28:23:00]</a>.
*   **UMAX (Looksmaxing App):** This app capitalizes on the "looksmaxing" movement, a deep internet subculture focused on improving physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:00">[41:01:00]</a>. UMAX scans a user's face, provides scores, and offers tips on improving features like jawline, skin, and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>. It generates millions in revenue primarily through TikTok distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:16:00">[42:16:00]</a>.
*   **Crayo:** An app that productizes courses on how teenagers can make money on TikTok and YouTube shorts by clipping streamer content and mass-posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:36:00">[44:36:00]</a>. It leverages an existing audience of young people seeking to earn money, transforming a course into automated software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:17:00">[45:17:00]</a>.
*   **Locks Club:** An exclusive dating app for Jewish people, which uses a content series like "How to find a nice Jewish boy in NYC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:55:00">[37:55:00]</a>. This type of culturally specific content can go viral on new brand accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:21:00">[38:21:00]</a>.

## Rethinking [[leveraging_creators_and_influencer_partnerships_for_business_growth | Influencer Marketing]] on TikTok

Traditional [[leveraging_creators_and_influencer_partnerships_for_business_growth | influencer marketing]] from the Instagram era, focused on paying influencers with millions of followers, is less effective on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:00">[33:13:00]</a>. This is because TikTok's "For You Page" algorithm prioritizes content quality over follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:47:00">[33:47:00]</a>. Most content on the "For You Page" comes from brand new accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:53:00">[33:53:00]</a>.

On TikTok, creators fill three roles: actor, director, and audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a>. The key is to skip the "audience" and "director" roles and hire creators simply as "actors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:31:00">[35:31:00]</a>. These creators can have zero followers, as their personal audience is irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:46:00">[35:46:00]</a>. The focus should be on finding people who know how to make good videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:56:00">[35:56:00]</a>.

Brands should create new accounts for specific content formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01:00">[39:01:00]</a>. For example, Tabs Chocolate creates multiple brand accounts, each with a dedicated creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>. This strategy is cost-effective as it involves finding small creators and having them create new accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:02:00">[37:02:00]</a>. If a format works, like the "food content" for colostrum videos, the algorithm learns which audience to serve it to, improving reach and reducing confusion caused by too many different faces on a single account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:02:00">[40:02:00]</a>.

## Cult-Like Movements as a Marketing Opportunity

Identifying and capitalizing on "cult-like" internet movements that lack a product attached to them presents a significant business opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:19:00">[43:19:00]</a>. These movements often revolve around universal human desires for health, wealth, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[43:55:00]</a>.

*   **High Lifetime Value Niches:**
    *   **Golfers:** Despite the stereotype of young TikTok users, niches with high-paying demographics like golfers are underserved by creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:22:00">[22:22:00]</a>. Apps offering AI golf swing analysis, similar to a personal coach (which can cost $125 for 60 minutes), have high revenue per download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>.
    *   **Poker Players:** Poker players represent an ideal customer base due to their willingness to spend on improving their game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:13:00">[29:13:00]</a>. Apps can help analyze hand history, strategies, or provide educational tips for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:47:00">[29:47:00]</a>. Many existing poker videos on TikTok are unmonetized or only promote gambling sites, creating an open field for app integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>.
    > [!NOTE] Integrating apps casually into existing content, such as flashing an app interface for a few seconds during a poker gameplay video, can lead to organic discovery through comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:32:00">[31:32:00]</a>.

## Importance of Product Quality

While [[effective_use_of_tiktok_and_social_media_for_app_marketing | TikTok marketing strategies]] offer immense distribution opportunities, the baseline requirement is a high-quality, "retentive" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:54:00">[46:54:00]</a>. Without product-led growth and strong retention metrics, a business will have a "leaky bucket," effectively becoming an e-commerce product that sells once rather than retaining users through subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:27:00">[47:27:00]</a>. Understanding user retention and lifetime value (LTV) allows for better marketing spend and continuous improvement of strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:42:00">[47:42:00]</a>.

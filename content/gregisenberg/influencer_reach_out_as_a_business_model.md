The concept of "influencer reach out as a business model" involves establishing a service agency dedicated to managing and executing influencer marketing campaigns for other companies [02:01:00]. This model addresses a common challenge faced by businesses: the significant time and resource investment required to effectively engage with digital influencers.

## Core Concept
This business model operates as a "done for you influencer marketing as a service" [02:01:00]. The agency acts as a broker, facilitating relationships and deals between software companies (or other brands) and influencers, primarily on platforms like YouTube [02:25:00].

## Target Clientele
The primary target audience for this service is software companies, particularly those in the B2B or SMB (small to medium-sized business) software space, or any company that is [[Building a Brand and Creating Influence | building in public]] [02:06:00]. Many founders of these companies struggle with scaling their influencer outreach efforts due to time constraints or a lack of expertise [02:37:00].

## Service Offering & Value Proposition
The agency offers "unlimited influencer Outreach" [02:34:00], typically to YouTube influencers [02:38:00].
Unlike traditional influencer agencies, which often focus merely on connecting brands with influencers, this model emphasizes a revenue-focused or return on ad spend (ROAS) approach [02:09:00]. The goal is to demonstrate tangible results for the client's investment [02:41:00].

## Execution Strategy

### Finding Clients
*   **Identify Software Companies:** Look for software companies being built, especially those that are "building in public" [02:10:00]. Twitter can be a good source for finding such tools [02:21:00].
*   **Cold Outreach:** Once potential clients are identified, use cold email or direct messages (DMs) to propose the service [02:19:00].

### Influencer Engagement Process
1.  **Influencer Identification:**
    *   Scrape YouTube channels to find potential influencers [02:42:00].
    *   YouTube's "About" section often displays the creator's email address [02:48:00].
    *   Services like Fiverr can be used to scrape YouTube channels for associated emails (search "YouTube lead generation" or "YouTube link building") [02:58:00].
2.  **Cold Email Campaigns:**
    *   Use a cold email software to reach out to the collected influencer emails [02:19:00].
    *   Consider using video (e.g., Loom) in emails for higher conversion rates [02:48:00].
    *   Show "growth graphs" (e.g., "up and to the right") to visually demonstrate success [02:25:00].
3.  **Deal Brokering & Payment Structure:**
    *   Negotiate deals between the client and influencers. A common structure involves a flat fee (e.g., $500 per video) coupled with recurring affiliate commissions (e.g., 30% of revenue generated) [02:28:00].
    *   Clients typically provide a budget for influencer work (e.g., $50k/month) [02:37:00].
4.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Analyze influencers based on subscriber counts, view counts, and cost. This allows the agency to identify and invest in "underpricing" influencers for a greater return on investment (ROI) for the client [02:54:00].
    *   Track affiliate commissions from all influencer activities to provide detailed ROI reports to clients [02:41:00].
    *   Reinvest capital into the influencers who consistently generate the most impact [02:36:00].

### The "Growth Flywheel" Effect
Once a sufficient number of influencers in a specific category begin discussing the client's product, a "growth flywheel" is initiated [02:50:00]. Up-and-coming influencers in that niche may start reviewing the product for free, driven by the desire for affiliate commissions. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle of promotion, building "digital gravity" for the client's product [02:50:00].

## Marketing Your Influencer Agency
*   **Authentic Founder Story:** Craft a compelling founder story that resonates with potential clients, highlighting past struggles with influencer marketing and how the agency's approach solves those problems [02:25:00]. Resources like Jason Fried's founder letters can serve as inspiration [02:50:00].
*   **Content as Lead Generation:**
    *   Create a YouTube channel with daily videos [02:40:00].
    *   Focus on "experiments in public," sharing what works and what doesn't in [[Influencer marketing techniques | influencer marketing]] (anonymizing client data and showing growth graphs) [02:45:00].
    *   This positions the agency as an expert, leading to inbound leads [02:59:00].
    *   Long-form content (videos over an hour) is particularly effective for convincing people to buy expensive services and building deep trust [03:07:00].
*   **Multi-Channel Approach:** Combine cold email and DMs with a strong YouTube presence to create a robust top-of-funnel strategy [02:22:00].

> High-production quality is not necessary for content. Simple Loom videos with good audio can be highly effective, as the value lies in the tactical, expert information shared [02:58:00].

## Potential Scale
This business model has the potential to become a million-dollar-a-year business by securing around 30 clients [00:45:00]. It's described as an ideal first company for an individual to start, with the potential to reach $30k a month within 200 days by consistently creating daily videos [03:53:00].

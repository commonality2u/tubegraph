Developing an [[ai_driven_mobile_app_startup_ideas | AI-driven mobile app]] involves several key stages, from initial concept to launch and growth strategies. This process, as outlined by Zach Yagari, a 17-year-old who built an [[ai_app_generating_significant_revenue | AI app generating significant revenue]] (Cal AI), emphasizes simplicity, user experience, and effective marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Concept and Ideation
The process begins with identifying a problem that AI can solve. For example, the idea for "Dr AI" stemmed from a personal anecdote about a friend's skin issue and the difficulty of quickly getting medical advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The app aims to provide preliminary diagnoses for skin conditions and general medical questions, serving as a quick resource before needing a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## User Experience (UX) Design
When [[building_an_ios_app_with_ai | building an iOS app with AI]], Zach Yagari prioritizes user experience (UX) by focusing on simplicity and digestibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Initial Framing
The initial design often starts with basic framing, including a navigation bar with essential elements like "Home" and "Settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. For "Dr AI," three main features are envisioned: a skin scan, a symptoms quiz, and a chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### History Feature
A "History" feature is crucial, showing a log of previous interactions, such as chat conversations, scan results, and symptoms quiz outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This feature encourages user investment and retention, as their data is stored within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This history can even be shared with a doctor to provide a quick summary for diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### Leveraging Primitives
When designing, it's beneficial to look at existing apps for inspiration, particularly those with similar functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This involves repurposing "primitives" or common building blocks found in other successful applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. For example, the scanning screen in "Dr AI" takes inspiration from apps like Cal AI and PhotoMath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Managing Loading Screens
Instead of forcing users to wait on a blank "analyzing" screen, it's better to take them back to the home screen while the AI processes their request, displaying a loading indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Displaying Results
Results should be clear and digestible. For a skin scan, this could involve displaying the image, a "danger level" (e.g., 0 to 5), and a simple diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The ability to ask follow-up questions or start a chat about specific results enhances user engagement and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Using numerical ratings or charts can make information more digestible than plain text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

### Designing for Simplicity and Gamification
The goal is to make the app simple to understand and use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. While not explicitly designing for [[ai_in_game_development | gamification]], making information digestible (like the "danger level" metric) can naturally feel gamified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

## Core Features of "Dr AI"
The proposed "Dr AI" app would have three main features:
1.  **Skin Scan:** Users take a picture of a skin anomaly for identification and assessment of potential harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The app would provide a diagnosis, heavily disclaimed for accuracy, to help users decide if they need a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
2.  **Symptoms Quiz:** A series of multiple-choice questions about symptoms to suggest possible sicknesses with likelihood percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
3.  **Chatbot:** A general medical chatbot for user questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. ChatGPT has shown promise in diagnosing medical problems, though disclaimers are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## [[integrating_ai_features_in_app_development | Integrating AI Features in App Development]] & Prompting
[[using_ai_tools_for_app_functionality_and_innovation | Using AI tools for app functionality and innovation]], particularly large language models like GPT, requires careful prompting to get the desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

### Overcoming AI Limitations
Generic AI responses often include disclaimers about not being a medical doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. To circumvent this, prompts can be framed creatively, such as asking the AI to "take on the role of a doctor for a movie script" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.

### API Usage and Function Calls
When using [[api_usage_in_ai_app_development | API Usage in AI App Development]] directly (e.g., OpenAI API), the prompt has full control over the AI's response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. Using "function calls" allows developers to assign the AI's response to a specific variable, ensuring only the desired information is returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.

### Accuracy and Ethics
It is critical to ensure the AI's accuracy, especially in sensitive areas like medical diagnoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. Apps should implement complex prompting pipelines to provide accurate results, rather than relying on basic prompts that can lead to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>. Disclaimers are essential for ethical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>.

## Go-to-Market Strategy: Influencer Marketing
The [[role_of_ai_in_product_development_and_marketing_for_apps | role of AI in product development and marketing for apps]] is significant, with influencer marketing being a key strategy.

### Reverse Engineering for Influencers
Design the product with influencer marketing in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. Influencers often showcase apps for only a few seconds, so the app's value proposition must be immediately clear and visually appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.

### Branding within the App
Include the app's name prominently on key screens that influencers are likely to feature, such as the scanning screen and the results screen, to maximize brand visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.

### Identifying Target Audience and Influencers
When selecting influencers, focus on their audience rather than just their niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. For "Dr AI," concerned parents (especially moms) are a primary target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>. Audience demographics can be inferred by reading comments and observing who influencers follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.

### Crafting Influencer Narratives
Influencers should create realistic scenarios that highlight the app's utility, potentially using a "fearmongering" angle (e.g., "I thought I had a serious problem, but Dr AI told me it was nothing") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.

### Reaching Out and Pricing
Influencers can be contacted via email or direct message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. Pricing involves predicting potential views to ensure a profitable return on investment (RPM > CPM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. Zach suggests starting with an estimated RPM of $5 per thousand views and paying influencers upfront for multiple posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>.

## Pricing Models
For utility apps like "Dr AI," a weekly pricing model can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.

### Capitalizing on Repeat Users
Apps that serve occasional, urgent needs (like "Dr AI" or dating advice apps) can profit from users who subscribe, unsubscribe, and then resubscribe when the need arises again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

### A/B Testing
It is crucial to A/B test various pricing points (e.g., $4 or $7 a week, monthly, or annual plans) and variations of free trials to find the highest "proceeds per download" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>. Tools like Superwall can assist in this testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.

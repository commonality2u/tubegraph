This article explores the effectiveness of OpenAI ChatGPT's Deep Research and Perplexity's Deep Research in generating and detailing startup ideas and their implementation playbooks. The goal was to test which AI tool provides better, more actionable insights for [[starting_a_saas_business_using_ai_tools | starting a SaaS business using AI tools]] and to potentially uncover a viable business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Understanding Deep Research

Deep Research in AI models like ChatGPT and Perplexity acts like a "junior analyst" or a "McKinsey analyst," providing in-depth information on a given question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Unlike quick answers, it performs extensive analysis to provide detailed insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Prompt

The core prompt given to both AI tools was:
"I want to create a startup. I want it to be an AI agent that focuses on a high-value niche. I want it to be defensible, not just a flash in the pan. I want you to create a zero-to-one playbook of how you'd launch it to get customers. Give me five ideas with five playbooks on how to grow it. I'm looking for $1 million year one, $3 million year two, $5 million year three." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>

Additional clarifying questions were posed to ChatGPT:
*   No specific industries of interest; seeking ideas with the highest likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   Open to B2B or B2C models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   No preference for AI applications (automation, data analysis), again focusing on the highest probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Preference for an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) costing $5,000 or less, with a non-technical founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   Open to cash flow but also potentially raising VC money if the business could scale beyond $100 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   Leaning towards viral self-serve growth for go-to-market, but open to suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Comparing AI Tools

### Cost and Initial Interaction
*   **ChatGPT Deep Research**: Requires a $200/month Pro Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. It asks follow-up clarifying questions to refine the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Perplexity Deep Research**: Costs $20/month, and some deep research capabilities can be used for free a few times a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. It does not ask follow-up questions initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Speed and Sources
*   **Perplexity Deep Research**: Faster, typically taking a "couple of minutes" for deep research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. It scans a high number of sources, starting from around 6 and going up to 34+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT Deep Research**: Takes longer, often around "eight minutes" for initial research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, and was observed to be slower than Perplexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Perplexity's Deep Research Example: Legal Contract Lifecycle AI Agent

Perplexity proposed an AI agent focused on legal contract lifecycle management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

*   **Problem Space**: Corporate legal teams spend 23% of their time on manual contract review and face issues with version control and compliance penalties, costing enterprises billions annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Defensible Solution**: An AI agent that:
    1.  Integrates with email, SharePoint, and DocuSign via API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
    2.  Learns organizational risk thresholds from historical contract analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
    3.  Auto-redlines third-party documents using firm-specific fallback positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
    4.  Maintains version lineage with blockchain-style audit trails (though this might be complex for an MVP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Defensibility**: The AI develops institutional memory from continuous exposure to negotiation outcomes, embeds into legal department workflows (averaging 14.3 logins per week per user), and requires significant retraining to replace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Growth Playbook**:
    *   **Phase 1 (Niche Validation - 90 days)**:
        *   **Product**: Build a Chrome extension to record legal contract review sessions (with permission) for training the initial model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
        *   **Go-to-Market**: Offer free redline audits for 100 AmLaw 200 firms, targeting mid-market companies ($50M-$500M revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
        *   **Monetization**: $2,500/month subscription locked to specific document types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
    *   **Phase 2 (Workflow Embedding - Months 4-9)**:
        *   Integrate with legal ops platforms like Lexion and Entra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
        *   Launch a Clause Library Builder using clients' historical favored language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
        *   Implement usage-based pricing at $0.25 per reviewed clause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
    *   **Phase 3 (Enterprise Scaling - Months 10-12)**:
        *   Add SOC 2 Type 2 compliance for regulated industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
        *   Develop custom connectors for ServiceNow and Salesforce CPQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
        *   Upsell to an $8,000/month Enterprise tier with custom playbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Financial Roadmap**:
    *   **Year 1**: 40 clients at $2,500/month (total $1.2M ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
    *   **Year 2**: 150 clients at $5,000/month plus $250k usage pay (total $3.1M ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
    *   **Year 3**: Platform fees from 300+ embedded instances (total $5.4M ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

The idea is deemed "incredible" and a "sip" (like it) rather than a "spit" (dislike it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

## ChatGPT's Deep Research Example: AI Sales Outreach Assistant

ChatGPT proposed an AI-powered sales outreach assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

*   **Concept**: An AI agent acting as a virtual Sales Development Representative (SDR), automating prospect research and personalized cold email/LinkedIn messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Target Market**: B2B companies, from startups to mid-sized firms, needing more pipeline without hiring additional SDRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
*   **Defensibility**: A "Data Network Effect" where the AI learns from every interaction, identifying effective messaging to build a unique data set for each industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. This leads to superior personalization and lead scoring that is hard for competitors to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Integration into CRMs and email systems further deepens the moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **MVP Development ($5,000 or less)**:
    *   **Focus**: Automate follow-up emails to warm leads using a templated but AI-personalized approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
    *   **Format**: A web app or Chrome extension where salespeople input prospects or connect their CRM, and the AI generates/sends personalized emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
    *   **Cost-saving strategies**:
        *   Use existing AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4) to generate text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.
        *   No expensive model training needed initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
        *   Simple UI using low-code tools or templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
        *   Single channel focus: start with email before expanding to LinkedIn or phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
        *   Manual fallback: allow human intervention if AI is unsure to ensure quality and gather data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
    *   **Timeline/Cost**: Can be built by a freelance developer in a few weeks; main cost under $5,000 would be developer time and API calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Customer Acquisition and Growth (Product-led Viral Adoption)**:
    *   **Self-served free tier**: Offer a limited free plan (e.g., 50 AI-generated emails/month) for individual sales reps or small startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
    *   **Viral Loop**: Prompt users to share success internally when the AI assistant books meetings or gets replies (e.g., "This meeting was set by AI") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
    *   **Network Effect**: As more reps use it, the AI performs better with shared data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.
    *   **Content Marketing**: Publish case studies and short demos (e.g., "How X startup tripled using AI") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. ChatGPT even cited a relevant example like Jenny AI growing to $5M ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.
    *   **Marketplace Listings**: Be present on CRM marketplaces like HubSpot for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.
*   **Monetization and Pricing**:
    *   **Per-seat or usage-based tiers**: Charge per sales rep ($50-$150/month for unlimited outreach) or by volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.
    *   **Typical structure**: Basic Plan ($49/month for solo rep, limited emails), Team Plan ($199/month for five reps, more emails, CRM integration), Enterprise for advanced features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.
    *   **Revenue Optimization**: Premium upsells, annual deals, premium features, performance-based options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
*   **VC Readiness**: The idea is presented as having the potential to scale to $100 million ARR, likely requiring VC funding to get there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.

ChatGPT's response is more in-depth and provides a "full-on business plan outline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, with strong relevance in its examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

## Follow-up Prompts and Refinements

The video also tested the ability of the AI tools to refine ideas based on user feedback.

*   **Perplexity (Follow-up to Legal AI Agent)**: When asked about existing highly funded competitors and how to make the idea non-obvious while staying under $5,000 for MVP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>:
    *   Acknowledged competitors like Harvey and CaseText <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
    *   Provided an "executive summary" and "competitive analysis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
    *   Identified "under-defended niches" and an "opportunity matrix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.
    *   Gave a "full-on MVP implementation plan" with a precise $4,800 budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>, including a Chrome extension prototype and specific tools (Manifest V3, TensorFlow JS for zero dev cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.
    *   Outlined a go-to-market sequencing with ideas like free clause vulnerability audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT (Follow-up to Sales Outreach Assistant)**: When asked to make the idea "more non-obvious" and to decide the best path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>, it suggested:
    *   Finding underserved niches, combining AI with other trends, leveraging proprietary data, introducing new business models, or enhancing with viral elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
    *   Provided a new idea: "AI Platform for Longtail Podcasts and Sponsors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>, focusing on streamlining production and bundling small podcasts for advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.
    *   Detailed the competitive moat through proprietary data advantage on content resonance and ad placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.
    *   Suggested an MVP development for $5,000, starting with an AI transcript and summary generator using tools like Whisper or AssemblyAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.

## Conclusion: Value of AI for Startup Development

Both AI deep research tools proved to be "insanely good" and "scary good" for generating and detailing startup ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.
*   **Perplexity Deep Research**: Praised for its speed and conciseness ("no fluff") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>, providing high-quality, actionable insights, though it may require more follow-up prompts to achieve desired depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. It's akin to "driving manual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT Pro Deep Research**: Offers more in-depth reports and provides a more comprehensive "one-shot" answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>, but takes longer to generate responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

Utilizing a deep research companion like these AI tools is a "no-brainer" for anyone building a zero-to-one startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, as it helps refine products for the highest probability of success and provides an "unfair advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>. While the user still needs to ask the right questions, these tools provide high-definition clarity on startup ideas and playbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. These platforms are excellent resources for [[using_ai_tools_for_generating_startup_ideas | generating startup ideas]], [[evaluating_ai_tools_for_startup_ideation | evaluating AI tools for startup ideation]], [[using_ai_for_creating_steps_in_startup_projects | creating steps in startup projects]], and [[building_apps_with_ai_tools | building apps with AI tools]].

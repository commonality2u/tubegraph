From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Starting a service business focused on Google Ads for a specific niche, referred to as "Google ads for XYZ," is presented as a perfect first company for anyone to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The core idea is to create an agency around a very specific target market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The "Google Ads for XYZ" Model
This business model involves targeting companies or individuals who are actively searching for "Google ads for [their specific niche]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Examples include "Google ads for apartments" or "Google ads for car dealerships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

### Leveraging YouTube for Lead Generation
A key strategy involves using YouTube as a "top of funnel" for service businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>:
*   **Ranking on Google:** For many longtail keyword phrases like "Google ads for apartments," the front page of Google often ranks a "snack pack" of three YouTube videos at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.
*   **Content Strategy:** Create videos titled specifically for these searches (e.g., "Google ads for apartments") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These videos should be detailed tutorials, around 20-30 minutes long, walking through the strategy, tactics, and philosophy of setting up Google Ads for that specific vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>.
*   **Monetization & Inbound Leads:**
    *   **Ad Revenue:** Videos can generate ad revenue, especially since high-value searches like "Google ads for XYZ" attract higher bids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>.
    *   **Affiliate Commissions:** Upsell high-value tools with affiliate commissions (e.g., Supermetrics, which offers enterprise-level software with high monthly pricing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. This can create a [[the_role_of_seo_and_paid_ads_in_business_growth | negative customer acquisition cost]] by subsidizing acquisition efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>.
    *   **Service Sales:** The primary long-term play is to generate inbound leads for your agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. Many viewers will find the detailed setup "mind-numbing" and prefer to hire a service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** Producing a video a day for 200 days could lead to earning $30,000 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>. This consistent content creation establishes the creator as an expert in the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

### Why this approach works:
*   **High Intent:** People searching for "Google ads for XYZ" have high intent to find a solution for their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.
*   **Low Competition (for YouTube ranking):** It's easier to rank a YouTube video on Google for these specific longtail keywords than it is to rank a traditional SEO article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>.
*   **Expert Positioning:** By teaching the process, the agency positions itself as an authority, building deep trust with potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
*   **Simplicity of Start:** This model can be started with little to no upfront cost, as videos don't require professional production (e.g., using a Loom video with a good mic and iPhone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.

## General Service Business Strategies
The podcast also covers broader strategies for starting and scaling service-based businesses:

### Niche Specialization (Local Only Marketing Agency for XYZ)
*   **Target Rich Person Services:** Focus on local services that cater to high-income individuals, where customer lifetime value (CLV) is high (e.g., CrossFit, estheticians, luxury car washes, Pilates, bar classes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. Avoid highly competitive and low-repeat purchase sectors like HVAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.
*   **Standardized Marketing Stack:** Once a marketing strategy is figured out for one business in a specific category, the exact same "marketing stack" can be repeatedly used for others in that niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   **Example: CrossFit Gyms:** Instagram ads targeting CrossFit interests within a geographical area and certain income brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This can include offering a free ebook download that leads to an email nurture campaign or growing an Instagram account via ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Client Acquisition:**
    *   **Google Maps Scraping:** Use services like Fiverr to scrape Google Maps for business listings and extract email addresses using tools like Hunter.io or Phantom Buster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   **Cold Email Outreach:** Validate scraped emails with tools like ZeroBounce, then send cold emails using software like Instantly with multiple domains and inboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. A daily sending volume of 32,000 cold emails per month is achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
        *   **Tips for Cold Outreach:**
            *   Translate emails for non-English speaking countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
            *   Use Loom videos within emails for higher conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
            *   "Show, don't tell" by including graphs of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
    *   **Cold Calling/DMs:** Utilize Instagram DMs, Facebook DMs, or even cold calls, depending on where the target audience spends time online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** Leverage AI tools to automate and standardize service delivery, potentially reducing the need for large offshore teams to one person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage:** Local markets often have unsophisticated competition, making it easy to outrank them with basic [[the_role_of_seo_and_paid_ads_in_business_growth | SEO]] (e.g., optimizing Google My Business listings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Referral Effect:** Niche industries often have tight-knit communities, leading to significant referral business once a good track record is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Pricing:** Agencies can charge around $3,000 a month for unlimited Google Ads services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>, or even consider a performance-based model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Thirty clients at $3,000 a month translates to a million-dollar-a-year business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

### The "Rank and Rent" Model
This is a local [[the_role_of_seo_and_paid_ads_in_business_growth | SEO]] play where one creates geography-optimized websites to rank for specific keywords (e.g., "pool cleaning XYZ") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. The leads generated from these sites are then sold to local businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. Examples include window cleaning companies doing $180,000 a month or yacht rental leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

### TikTok SEO as a Service
Recognizing that Gen Z often uses social media (Instagram, TikTok) for local searches rather than Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>, this model focuses on ranking businesses on these platforms.
*   **Content:** Create user-generated content (UGC) like "five best pizzerias in [city/neighborhood]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>. This is akin to BuzzFeed listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>.
*   **Ranking & Refreshing:** Social SEO allows for more frequent content refreshing (every 30-60 days) with continued impact, unlike traditional [[the_role_of_seo_and_paid_ads_in_business_growth | SEO]] which has a longer time horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.
*   **Acquisition & Pricing:** Businesses can be sold on this service for $1,000-$2,000 a month, especially higher-end establishments like fine dining or cocktail bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
*   **Growth & Flywheel Effect:**
    *   **Paid Ads:** Run Instagram-only ads with a call to action to follow the account, creating a "follow funnel." These followers can then be retargeted with content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.
    *   **Cross-Promotion:** Pay other local viral creators to review client locations, fostering cross-promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Digital Gravity:** Viral moments can lead to other creators including the business in their content, creating a larger flywheel effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.
    *   **Replacing Yelp:** This approach aims to replace traditional review platforms like Yelp and Google Maps, as discovery is shifting to social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.
*   **CRM & Communication:** Use tools like Lelo (a "drop CRM" for email, SMS, and Instagram DMs) to manage audience communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

### Key Learnings for Service Businesses
*   **Accountability:** Creating tutorials and daily content forces the business owner to learn and become proficient in the skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.
*   **Long-Form Content:** Long-form content (like YouTube tutorials) is significantly more impactful (10x more for B2B) than short-form content for convincing people to buy expensive services, as it builds deeper trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.
*   **Every Company is a Media Company:** Building owned media assets (like YouTube channels, newsletters, podcasts) is economically more viable than traditional marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>. This creates marketing leverage and inbound opportunities with larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Zero-to-One Focus:** The speaker emphasizes their strength in starting and scaling businesses from zero to one, synthesizing different components together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:19">[01:29:19]</a>.

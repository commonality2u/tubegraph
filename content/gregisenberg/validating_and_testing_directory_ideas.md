From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Validating and testing online directory ideas is a crucial first step in building a successful platform, with some individuals making upwards of $5,000 to $20,000 a month with these ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. John Rush emphasizes that starting an online directory is one of the lowest-risk ways to launch a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The current "Golden Era of directories" highlights a growing demand for curated content, which directories effectively provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The process involves three important steps: coming up with ideas, [[methods_for_validating_startup_ideas_without_building_them | validating them before building]], and then working on [[seo_optimization_for_directory_websites | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. People increasingly trust well-curated directories over raw search engine results because they offer quality and expert selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Finding and Validating Niche Ideas

The best way to find a worthwhile directory idea is to start with [[methods_for_finding_and_validating_niche_ideas | keyword research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This helps determine if people are actively searching for certain terms or phrases, validating the potential demand for an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Using Google Keyword Planner

Google Keyword Planner, primarily used for ad planning, can also be leveraged to assess search traffic for potential directory keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. John Rush spends hours daily throwing random ideas into this tool to check for traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

For instance, the keyword "business ideas" sees nearly 1 million searches per month with low ad competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. When choosing a domain name, aim for an exact match or a close semantic match to the primary keyword for better [[seo_optimization_for_directory_websites | SEO]] performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Google's algorithm now prioritizes meaning over exact word matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. For example, "mini business ideas" was chosen because "mini" has a similar meaning to "small," which was a high-traffic keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Domains should be inexpensive, typically under $9, encouraging creativity in finding available names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Building and Initial Launch Strategy

When building a directory, avoid coding from scratch, even if you are a developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. [[tools_and_techniques_for_creating_online_directories | No-code platforms]], like Unicorn Platform, allow for faster launches and provide out-of-the-box features essential for marketing, such as marketing pages, A/B tests, and programmatic [[seo_optimization_for_directory_websites | SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Simplicity is Key

For the first launch of a directory, only focus on including the items themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Features like ratings or user reviews are unnecessary initially as there will be no users or data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. A simple page with a name and items is sufficient, with other features to be added months or even a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

AI can assist in generating initial content, such as menus, structure, text, subtitles, and even an FAQ section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. An FAQ section is valuable for [[seo_optimization_for_directory_websites | SEO]] because each title can address a common Google search query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Use Google's "suggested searches" (e.g., typing "how to start" and seeing what comes up) to find relevant questions to answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### Iterative Testing and Validation

The core approach for directories is to do as little as possible to validate assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

Instead of immediately creating full pages, start with simpler items or FAQ entries and monitor queries in Google Search Console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. If a keyword shows traffic, then invest human time to create a more detailed page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

The initial setup, including building and promoting on Reddit and social media, and setting up initial [[seo_optimization_for_directory_websites | SEO]], should take no more than two evenings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

After this initial burst of activity, cease working on the directory and return in 30 days to check the traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

### Batch Testing Ideas

*   **Diversify your bets:** Instead of falling in love with a single directory idea, launch five to ten at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. This increases the chances of success and reduces disappointment if one fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
*   **Evaluate after 30 days:** After a month, analyze the traffic for each directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. If a directory has no traffic, it's likely a fundamental flaw (e.g., wrong domain name, keyword difficulty), and it's difficult to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.
*   **Focus on winners:** Dedicate more time and effort to the directory that performs best in terms of traffic and initial interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. The first 30 days are solely for validating potential [[seo_optimization_for_directory_websites | SEO]] traffic and user interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

This rapid, iterative approach ensures that resources are invested only in ideas that show early promise, significantly lowering the risk compared to traditional software (SaaS) development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.

David Park, who scaled his AI startup Jenny AI to $10 million ARR, includes [[role_of_paid_ads_in_app_scaling | paid ads]] as part of his comprehensive [[growth_tactics_for_ai_startups | growth tactic playbook]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. While effective at later stages, Park suggests caution for early-stage startups regarding their immediate use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>.

## When to Use Paid Ads

According to Park, [[role_of_paid_ads_in_app_scaling | paid ads]] are often a "trap" for early-stage entrepreneurs due to their slow iteration cycles compared to [[organic_growth_and_marketing_for_apps | organic short-form content]] or [[Marketing and user acquisition for AI startups | influencer marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. A significant amount of time must be spent in the learning phase and on [[creating_effective_facebook_ads_for_business_growth | creating effective creatives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>. Many companies can become perpetually unprofitable by relying on [[role_of_paid_ads_in_app_scaling | paid ads]] at a 1:1 or 1.5:1 customer acquisition cost (CAC) to lifetime value (LTV) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>.

Instead, it is recommended to implement [[role_of_paid_ads_in_app_scaling | paid ads]] after achieving some level of product-market fit (PMF) and establishing a steady income stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>.

> [!tip] Leverage Existing Success
> One major benefit of using [[role_of_paid_ads_in_app_scaling | paid ads]] later is the ability to reuse content that has already proven to resonate [[organic_growth_and_marketing_for_apps | organically]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. Data from previous social media partnerships can also significantly improve targeting for [[creating_effective_facebook_ads_for_business_growth | paid ad campaigns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>, allowing for insights into which countries convert better, their LTVs, and ideal user demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>.

## Key Metrics and Strategy

Jenny AI aims for a 3:1 LTV to CAC ratio with a short payback period, ideally making money back within the first two months of acquiring a user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>. This quick return on investment allows for continuous reinvestment into top-performing acquisition channels, whether it's [[organic_growth_and_marketing_for_apps | UGC]], [[Marketing and user acquisition for AI startups | influencer marketing]], SEO, or further [[role_of_paid_ads_in_app_scaling | paid ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.

The speaker notes that [[role_of_paid_ads_in_app_scaling | paid ads]] are personally considered the "most boring growth channel," suggesting that founders should explore "fun" alternatives first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.

> [!caution] Initial Budget Limitations
> In the early stages, startup budgets are often insufficient to spend enough on platforms like Meta to gather the necessary data for effective targeting based on purchase conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. This further supports delaying significant investment in [[role_of_paid_ads_in_app_scaling | paid ads]] until organic channels have provided valuable insights and revenue.

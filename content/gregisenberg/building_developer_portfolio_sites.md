The concept of building dedicated portfolio sites for developers emerged as one of 139 startup ideas shared by Danny Grant. Grant is recognized for her foresight in identifying market trends and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The Core Idea: "Danny Town" for Developers

Danny Grant's idea proposes helping "every developer create their own Danny town" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. "Danny town" is assumed to be her personal portfolio website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The inspiration comes from `format.com`, a portfolio builder specifically designed for creative professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The suggestion is to create a similar platform, but tailored for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Differentiating from GitHub

While GitHub already exists as a platform for developers to showcase their code, it is noted that GitHub is "not as beautiful as a format" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This suggests an opportunity to build a more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly portfolio site builder specifically for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Market Opportunity and Revenue Potential

`format.com` is a significant business, boasting over 50,000 paying users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Users pay $12 a month annually or $24 a month monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. At an average of $15 a month, this translates to roughly $750,000 in monthly recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Website builders are considered "beautiful businesses" because once a website is built, users are unlikely to churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This indicates a high retention rate and stable revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Implementation Strategy

The suggested approach for [[building_apps_without_coding | building apps without coding]] a developer portfolio site builder involves:
1.  **Creator-Led Strategy:** Similar to the "Lenny Ritky strategy" for product managers, the idea is to partner with influential developers who have large followings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
2.  **Initial Design & Refinement:** Start by building one "really awesome developer portfolio site" for a few developers, focusing on unique and interesting designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The goal is to get them "super stoked" about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
3.  **Develop MVP:** Once the product is refined and has user validation, build a [[building_mvps_without_coding | minimal viable product (MVP)]] and begin charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Analogy to Card.co

The success of `card.co` (Carrd.co) serves as an encouraging example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Carrd.co, a one-page website builder, was bootstrapped by a single developer in Tennessee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Despite charging a very low annual fee (around nine dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, it achieved success with millions of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This demonstrates that website builders, even for specific niches, can be highly effective businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

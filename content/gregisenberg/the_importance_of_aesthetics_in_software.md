From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 
The importance of aesthetics in software is a growing focus for developers, with a shift from "luxury software" to "aesthetic software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This emphasizes visual appeal and user experience as core components, rather than just premium pricing or exclusive features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

## Why Aesthetics Matter
Daniel Dalan, whose father is an architect, grew up fascinated by design and aesthetics, leading him to value them in his own work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. He observes that simple tools like Raycast are appealing because they "look smooth [and] work smooth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

Aesthetics contribute significantly to the perceived value of a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. In a world saturated with information, clean, clear, and well-blended design helps products make sense and stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

## Aesthetics and Product Development
When building a product, the core value proposition is paramount, akin to ensuring a car can drive before adding luxuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. However, [[balancing_aesthetics_with_text_prompts_and_style_references | aesthetics can draw attention]] and help validate an idea in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

For a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), a clean and aesthetically pleasing landing page is crucial for initial engagement and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. This can be achieved with simple elements like a nice font, good header, and a well-designed email sign-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.

### Incorporating Visual Elements
[[incorporating_visual_interest_and_effects_in_ui_design | Animations can significantly enhance a product's appeal]] and user engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. Tools like Vercel and [[creating_software_without_writing_code | Framer]] or even AI platforms can be used to quickly develop basic designs and animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. Even simple designs can be sufficient if they clearly communicate the product's function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.

## Examples
*   **Superhuman:** Cited as an example of software that offers a "luxury experience" due to its design and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. Its "sent with Superhuman" signature also serves as a [[building_highquality_web_interfaces_with_AI | status symbol and marketing tool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Raycast:** Praised for its smooth appearance and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   **Instant.so:** A [[creating_and_utilizing_templates_in_software_development | Shopify page builder]] that leverages optimized templates and AI to generate "liquid components" (Shopify's native code language) for quick and aesthetic store creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.
*   **Zoho:** Described as the "Costco of software," representing a more utilitarian approach where design might be less prioritized in favor of broad functionality and lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

## Evolution of Design
The standard for simple websites has significantly evolved, making it easier to create aesthetically pleasing sites quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. Tools like the Wayback Machine on archive.org allow users to see how websites, such as Late Checkout, looked in earlier, less polished stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>. This highlights that initial designs can be basic, with [[developing_a_product_roadmap_and_user_interface_design | continuous iteration leading to more polished outcomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.The importance of aesthetics in software is a growing focus for developers, with a shift from "luxury software" to "aesthetic software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

[[AI agents are replacing what teams of people used to do | AI agents are replacing what teams of people used to do]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The primary opportunity lies not in creating better AI, but in [[building_competitive_ai_businesses | building businesses around AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The tools are available, and the market desires solutions, but connections are not yet fully made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. These business ideas aim to solve real problems and could potentially be worth millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

AI is considered a strong accelerator for various business aspects, including ideation, organization, process creation, implementation, operation, and integrating AI-driven features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. It's suggested that anyone starting a business today should embrace AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Business Idea 1: AI Co-founder / Virtual Person

The first idea focuses on an "AI co-founder" or a "virtual always-on 24/7 always available co-founder" to assist solo founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This AI would handle tasks typically performed by teams, such as marketing, sales, bizdev, and financials, which many founders may not enjoy or excel at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Instead of just bouncing ideas back and forth, this AI co-founder would constantly think about and execute tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. An example is a smart marketing AI that understands the founder's voice and tone, as well as the lives of target customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. It would scrape the web and scour data sources to create an internal representation of a person, then determine the best way to communicate with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

The business could offer various AI agents, such as a marketing AI, a CTO AI, or a sales AI, as a scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. These virtual agents would possess deep skills in their respective fields, learn about the business, and continuously generate new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

A potentially interesting future for this idea is enabling these AI agents to interact with each other in virtual meetings, exchanging ideas and bringing new insights to their respective businesses, akin to "Mastermind groups of AI agents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Regarding concerns about the lack of emotional connection with an AI co-founder, it's suggested that the AI is not meant to replace human emotional support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Large Language Models (LLMs) are described as "gaslighting engines" that try to convince users they are correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This behavior, in a way, mimics how people try to convey ideas and get things done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

The idea suggests training these models to align with the founder's personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Users might be able to pick a template for the AI's personality, or the system could scrape public data (e.g., blog posts, social presence) to integrate a specific person's virtual version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This could even lead to stronger bonds between founders and AI agents than between human co-founders, as AI would not experience social tension or anxiety when resources are low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

The value proposition is providing access to a "person that has the knowledge of the world combined into a personality that can help you make choices quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This is seen as a valuable "crutch" for founders, costing potentially $50-$100 per month, with a high likelihood of generating ROI through constant outreach, research, and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

A specific example of AI agents providing value is illustrated with Podscan, an app that gives real-time mention notifications from podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. An agent could listen to podcasts and monitor blogs in real-time, alerting a founder if a competitor is mentioned, allowing for immediate follow-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### Niche Focus for AI Co-founder

To avoid "boiling the ocean" due to diverse startup needs, a founder building this product should pick a specific niche, such as YC founders or SaaS founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. This focus allows for training a specific model that talks the right language and provides the right motivation for that niche, although specialized models can be expensive to train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

For a bootstrapped approach, it's suggested to start with streamlining existing AI use by founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. This involves centralizing information, documents, and conversations to create a unified place for AI interaction, rather than requiring users to jump between different tools like ChatGPT's web interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This iterative approach would reveal what is truly needed by users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

## Business Idea 2: Silent Refactoring as a Service (Code Could Be Better)

This idea proposes an AI service that constantly monitors and improves a codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. The service would connect to a code repository and perform:
- Error checking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>
- Linting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>
- Syntax and logic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>
- Suggesting fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>

Tools like Sentry already exist, offering beta features that suggest fixes and create pull requests for errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. The proposed service, however, would go further by continuously trying to improve the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

The core function would involve the AI taking a code module, identifying potential improvements, making changes, and then simulating how the application would perform with those changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. This includes running unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests in a simulated, lifelike environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. If an improvement doesn't yield better results (e.g., slower performance), the AI moves to the next idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. After constant optimization, it would present "fully developed code, fully tested code, fully commented code" that tangibly improves the application's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

The tool could also connect to a product roadmap, anticipating future features and suggesting improvements to the database, codebase, documentation, and data schema to facilitate easier implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. Essentially, it acts as an "autonomous developer that just constantly tries to make things better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. The suggested name for this service is "Code Could Be Better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

### Pricing Model for "Code Could Be Better"

Pricing for such a service could start based on computational costs, as various AI steps (text analysis, LLM inference, code generation, simulation) are compute-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. To manage costs, the service might offload some computational burden (e.g., actual testing instance spins) to the customer, focusing its own expense on the GPU-accelerated AI work (prompts, context building, embedding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.

Pricing could be per connected repository or based on the frequency of experiments (e.g., "once a day I'm looking for the biggest problem") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. An alternative approach is value-based pricing, considering the ROI. If the tool effectively replaces three full-time developers working 24/7, it could justify a high price point (e.g., replacing $200,000+ in fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

Initially, for a bootstrapped approach, starting with basic features like static analysis, error analysis, and linting could position the service in the $50-$100 per month range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. As more capabilities are added, especially those involving riskier experiments with infrastructure, the price would increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.

## Business Idea 3: Niche Data Aggregation and Summarization (Trust the Data Platform)

This idea addresses the issue of algorithmic timelines on social media and the difficulty of consuming relevant information in specific niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. The concept involves [[automating_business_processes_with_ai_agent_swarms | building systems to aggregate information from a specific niche]] and present it to less technical people in that niche as a summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>.

The example of Podscan users is cited, where individuals in a specific medical sub-industry use the tool to aggregate and summarize industry information for doctors who lack time to consume numerous podcasts daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.

The business would scrape, collect, and extract data from various relevant sources for a chosen niche:
- Real-time data streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>
- APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>
- News sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>
- Social media feeds and influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>
- Newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>
- Even physical magazines (using OCR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>

The key "twist" is summarizing this information on a per-subscriber level, tailoring the output to individual preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>. For example, some users might prefer bullet points, others a few paragraphs, and some a longer, detailed email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.

Future delivery could include preferred mediums:
- Fake podcast conversations between two AI experts in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>
- Short newsletters (e.g., James Clear style) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>
- News story podcasts with preferred tone and voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>
- [[AI-generated videos with screen grabs or images of articles and social media content | AI-generated videos with screen grabs or images of articles and social media content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>

The core process involves taking data, aggregating it, summarizing it, and then shaping it into something consumable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. This business caters to audiences thirsty for curated information without having to do the work themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.

Success hinges on picking the right niche and reliably curating the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. A small monthly fee (e.g., $9) could be charged for access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>. The most valuable aspect is understanding the audience and how to communicate with them, tailoring information to different professions (e.g., designers vs. engineers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

It is advantageous for the founder to be an "overlapping expert" or at least a "dabbler" in the chosen niche, as this allows for better understanding of the audience's needs and effective prompting of AI for content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>. This type of business can also serve as a "wedge" to [[building_and_launching_an_ai_saas_business | build SaaS products]] for that community in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.

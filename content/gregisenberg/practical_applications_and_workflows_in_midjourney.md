Midjourney is considered a new artistic medium, offering a different canvas and a distinct approach to problem-solving. It allows users to blend and balance entire aesthetics with complex layers to achieve desired visual outcomes, which can then be infinitely re-prompted using a successful "recipe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Why Use Midjourney?
[[Midjourney as a new artistic medium | Midjourney]] serves multiple purposes for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>:
*   **Inspiration and Ideation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>: It functions as a powerful tool for brainstorming ideas, creating mood boards, and exploring concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. Users have more control over the discovery process compared to traditional image searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:38">[01:11:38]</a>.
*   **Production Tool** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>: With features like the editor, users can modify existing assets, out-paint, and add new elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>.
*   **Art Therapy & Discovery Engine** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>: Many find it enjoyable and therapeutic, getting lost in the creative process and exploring aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>.
*   **Creative Control** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>: It offers extensive control over the aesthetic direction, moving beyond simple text prompt interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Moving to the Midjourney Web App
A key recommendation is to migrate from Discord to the [[Exploring Midjourneys tools and features | Midjourney web app]] at `midjourney.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The web app offers a superior working environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Key Sections of the Web App
*   **Create Tab**: Where most of the work will be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Explore Tab**: Contains all publicly available generations, serving as a vast library for inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   Users can search for specific styles (e.g., "vintage poster") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    *   A search icon allows finding similar results based on subject matter and style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
    *   Options include "Use Prompt", "Use Style", or "Use Image" directly from the explore tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Stealth Mode**: Available on the Pro Plan and above, allowing private prompting to prevent assets from showing up in the public database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This is crucial for client or brand work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. It can be toggled in the settings of the prompt bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Organize Tab**: Users can filter by "liked" images, making it easier to find preferred generations later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. Liking favorites should be a habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

## Exploring Aesthetics and Styles
The process often starts with a subject and a desired medium (e.g., painting, illustration, photograph, 3D) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Using External Images as Inspiration
External images, such as old posters, can be used as a starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. These can be found on platforms like Reddit, Pinterest, or through Google image searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Image Prompts vs. Style References
This is a critical distinction in Midjourney's workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>:
*   **Image Prompt (Pict Icon)**: When an image is added as an image prompt (default), Midjourney attempts to pull in the subject matter, elements, and actual pixels of that image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This can lead to "wonky" results if the goal is only to transfer style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
*   **Style Reference (Paperclip Icon)**: When an image is set as a style reference, Midjourney decouples the aesthetic from the subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. It understands the underlying stylistic elements (colors, composition, lighting, texture, pattern) and integrates them into the new generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.

Initial exploration often involves starting with a basic subject and a style reference to see how Midjourney interprets the style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

## Understanding and Using Parameters
Midjourney's parameters act as "aesthetic levers" that guide and push the aesthetics in different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. The goal is to learn how to balance and find harmony among them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

*   **Style Weight (`--sw`)**: Determines how much influence a style reference has on the generation. Default is 100, but can go up to 1000 for stronger influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratio (`--ar`)**: Defines the width-to-height ratio of the image (e.g., `--ar 2:3` for a poster print) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **No Parameter (`--no`)**: Instructs Midjourney to remove specific elements from the generation (e.g., `--no text`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.
*   **Stylize (`--s`)**: Controls how much of the Midjourney model's default aesthetic is applied. A high stylize value (e.g., `--s 1000`) can make images look "AI-generated," while a lower value (default `--s 100`) offers more creative leeway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Permutation Prompts**: Using curly brackets `{}` with comma-separated values (e.g., `--sw {50,100,200}`) allows running multiple parameter values in one go to quickly compare results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

## Personalization
[[Using style references and personalization in Midjourney | Midjourney's personalization feature]] allows the model to learn a user's aesthetic preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.
*   **How to Activate**: Go to the `personalize` tab and rate images by selecting favorites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>.
*   **Impact**: The more images rated, the better Midjourney understands preferences such as color, lighting, general style (photographic vs. illustrative), and even subject matter (e.g., certain animals, ethnicities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
*   **Effect**: Personalization fine-tunes the model, resulting in aesthetics that align with the user's taste, rather than the community-curated default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. It can be blended with other users' personalizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.

## SRF Codes (Style Reference Codes)
[[Using style references and personalization in Midjourney | Style Reference Codes]] (`--sref`) are like coordinates in a multi-dimensional "Style Space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.
*   **Functionality**: These codes direct the prompt to a specific aesthetic location, influencing subsequent generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.
*   **Scale**: There are billions of possible SRF codes, and users often "mine" and curate the best ones into lists or "style reference books" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.
*   **Blending Styles**: Multiple SRF codes can be combined in a single prompt to blend different aesthetics, similar to mixing paints on a palette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. Each code represents a complex mix of color, composition, lighting, texture, and pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.
*   **Syntax for Blending Weights**: Using `::` after an SRF code (e.g., `sref code1::2 sref code2::1`) allows users to specify the relative weight of each style reference in the blend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.

## Editing and Refining Images
Midjourney offers tools to refine generated images:
*   **Editor Feature**: Allows users to paint out unwanted elements (e.g., text) directly on the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.
*   **Variations**:
    *   **Subtle Variations**: Maintain most image details while making minor changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
    *   **Strong Variations**: Lead to more dramatic compositional changes while retaining the general vibe and subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.

## Future Applications
Projects are underway to physically manifest latent space, exploring ways to bring AI-generated art into the physical world. This includes using robots to paint, play music, and utilizing large-format printers and 3D printers to create tangible art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. This also involves integrating AI-generated images with [[Integration of AI tools like Runway and Midjourney | image-to-video models]] to animate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.

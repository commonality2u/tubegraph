Frey, an expert in online directories, teaches how to [[starting_an_online_directory | build an online directory]] that can generate between $2,000 and $10,000 a month in actual [[generating_passive_income_through_online_directories | passive income]], requiring only about 15 minutes of work per week for maintenance once established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The core of this process involves [[choosing_and_validating_a_niche | finding and validating a niche]] idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Frey's first directory website, built in October 2022, has been [[monetizing_online_directories | monetized]] for 18 months straight, is evergreen, location-based, and took about 15 minutes a month to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This directory generated around $2,300 in revenue last month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The approach focuses on creating a basic directory optimized for SEO, ensuring the chosen niche solves a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Examples of Successful Directories
Before diving into the process, Frey highlights several existing directories to showcase their potential:

*   **RoadsideAmerica.com**: A directory of quirky roadside attractions in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Despite its outdated appearance, it receives 85,000 monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, primarily Tier 1 traffic (US, Canada, Australia, UK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. It's monetized through display ads and is estimated to make $5,000-$7,000 per month passively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. It has shown resilience to Google core updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **AtlasObscura.com**: A worldwide directory of off-the-beaten-path attractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This site gets an impressive 5 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, with 90-91% Tier 1 traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Monetization is primarily through display ads (AdSense) and book sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Conservative earnings from AdSense are estimated at $30,000 per month, potentially closer to $50,000-$60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **FindAGrave.com**: A directory for locating burial sites, including famous individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. It receives 1.4 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, with 92% Tier 1 traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Monetized through AdSense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, it's estimated to make $60,000-$70,000 per month, with potential for $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

These examples highlight the potential for generating significant passive income and demonstrating the resilience of directories to search engine updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Identifying Niche Ideas
Frey's preferred directories are "evergreen" and "location-based" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, meaning they don't require frequent data updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Using Ahrefs Keyword Explorer
To find ideas, Frey uses Ahrefs' Keyword Explorer and types "near me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This reveals a list of local queries with high search volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

The goal is to find keywords with:
*   **High Monthly Search Volume**: Indicates demand for the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Frey's "sweet spot" for monthly searches is between 30,000 and 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   **Low Keyword Difficulty**: Suggests less competition, making it easier to rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Generally, anything under 20 is considered easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. However, keyword difficulty can be misleading; some low-difficulty keywords might still be hard to rank for due to dominant backlinks or high competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. If one knows what they are doing, 40-50 can also be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

### What to Avoid
Frey advises avoiding certain types of niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>:
*   **Seasonal Niches**: Avoid topics that only perform well for a short period, like "pumpkin patches near me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Difficult Data Acquisition**: Niches where data is hard to obtain, such as "earthquake near me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Branded Keywords**: Avoid queries like "Taco Bell near me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
    *   Big brands likely already have updated directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
    *   Search intent is too "one-dimensional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. People looking for a specific brand aren't seeking different *types* of that brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

### The "Dog Parks Near Me" Example
Frey uses "dog parks near me" as a tutorial example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This keyword gets 73,000 monthly searches and has a keyword difficulty of 27/100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

It's a good niche because:
*   **Fragmented/Multi-dimensional Search Intent**: People aren't just looking for *any* dog park; they're looking for "indoor dog park," "off-leash dog park," "dog water park," and specific amenities like water fountains, benches, or shade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. This allows for rich data enrichment and catering to diverse user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Solving a Problem**: It saves users time by providing detailed information beyond what Google Maps offers, eliminating the need to click through reviews to find specific features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## Validating Niche Ideas
Once a potential niche is identified, it's crucial to validate it through competitive research and social listening. This falls under the umbrella of [[identifying_and_validating_niche_markets | identifying and validating niche markets]].

### Competitive Research (Using Google)
Frey uses Google to conduct competitive research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. The process involves:
1.  **Searching**: Type in niche-specific queries (e.g., "Dog Park Los Angeles") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
2.  **Identifying Existing Directories**: Look for any directories on the first page of search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
3.  **Assessing Improvement Potential**: Analyze existing directories to see if a new one can offer better features, more comprehensive information, or a better user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
    *   **Example: Nyabone.com**: A very basic dog park directory getting 21,000 monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. It only lists the name and address of dog parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. This presents a clear opportunity for improvement by adding features like water fountains, benches, or shade information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. This indicates that Google Maps is not fully satisfying users' needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
    *   **Example: BringFido.com**: A larger dog-related website with a dog park directory getting around 13,000 dog park-specific traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. While better than Nyabone, it still lacks specific details like dog bags or water fountains, leaving room for a more detailed directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

### Social Listening (Using Reddit)
Reddit is used to confirm whether the identified niche problem is genuinely worth solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.
1.  **Search Reddit**: Type in queries like "Dog Park Los Angeles Reddit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
2.  **Look for Discussions**: Observe forums where people are actively looking for information or discussing challenges related to the niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. This confirms that people are looking for alternatives to Google Maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.
3.  **Identify Unmet Needs**: Read comments and discussions to find specific problems or desires.
    *   **Example: "Dog Run" in New York**: Frey discovered that in New York, dog parks are often called "dog runs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. A Reddit post from six years prior, sharing Google Map pins of dog parks, had significant engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. A key comment stated: "I wish I had time to visit all of them and make descriptions and take photos. Not all dog runs are created equal so it'd be cool to find out about really nice ones that aren't nearby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.
    *   **Social Signal**: This comment is a clear "green flag" indicating a demand for curated, hyper-specific features and detailed information that general maps or basic directories don't provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.

## Conclusion of Validation
By following these steps, one can find an idea with high search volume and low competition, confirm fragmented search volume that can be leveraged, identify competition to outperform, and verify demand through social listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This process of [[validating_and_building_directory_ideas | finding and validating directory ideas]] is critical whether building a small lifestyle business or a larger venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>.

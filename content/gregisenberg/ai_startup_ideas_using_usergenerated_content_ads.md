From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

This episode promises to provide at least seven [[ai_startup_ideas | AI app ideas]] with validating data and trend information, along with distribution strategies for marketing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The goal is for listeners to leave with a clear idea and distribution plan, needing only to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The information shared is current and actionable, unlike "old ideas" sold by some course creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes a commitment to transparency: "if you want to know anything just like literally send me a DM on Twitter and I will make a public video showing everything on how to do all of this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. They lament outdated information being sold, noting that two-year-old data is a "lifetime" in the rapidly evolving AI world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Idea 1: UGC Ads Using AI

The first startup idea focuses on creating User-Generated Content (UGC) ads using AI, rather than real people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This is presented as a significant [[marketing_opportunities_and_business_models_using_aigenerated_content | marketing opportunity]] due to rapidly increasing search volume for "UGC ads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Traditionally, UGC was used for ads, but now there's a chance to use AI avatars and AI-written scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. These AI-generated videos can serve as both paid ads and organic social media content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Execution Process

The recommended approach involves problem-solution style storytelling, with the product as the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

1.  **Initial Script:** A human writes the initial script, often in a conversational, first-person style (e.g., "I was talking to my friend...") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
2.  **Script Variations:** Use tools like ChatGPT to generate 10 different variations of the script in the same format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
3.  **AI Avatar Generation:** Take these scripts to AI platforms like HeyGen or Argil AI to generate videos with AI avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. These can then be handed off to a video editor or done directly within the AI tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

This process significantly cuts costs and time. What previously took five days and approximately $500 per 30-second clip can now be done for about $80 per clip using an AI avatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Generating 10 variations could save roughly $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Business Models

Two primary [[ai_startup_business_model | business model]] options for this [[using_ai_for_ad_creation | using AI for ad creation]] strategy are:

*   **Agency:** Build an agency that creates these AI-powered UGC ads for companies. Clients would provide background images and photos, and the agency would produce unlimited content variations for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Product:** Develop a product or service that automates parts of this process, allowing companies to create their own AI-driven UGC ads at scale.

### Advantages and Market Impact

This strategy offers a "massive arbitrage" opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

*   **Scalability:** It allows for the generation of hundreds or thousands of ad variations (A-Z testing instead of A/B testing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This enables rapid identification of winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Cost Optimization:** By finding winning ads, costs per click (CPC) can be dramatically reduced (e.g., from $1 to $0.10), effectively multiplying ad budgets (e.g., turning $10,000 into $100,000 in revenue impact) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Platform Intelligence:** Platforms like Facebook are intelligent enough to identify which ad variations will generate the most conversions if enough variations are provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Speed:** What used to take days to iterate can now be done in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. This scale was previously impossible without significant capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Organic Social:** The same content can also be used for organic social media, potentially generating views on platforms like TikTok's For You Page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Accessibility:** The tools required are relatively inexpensive, costing around $150 for subscriptions to HeyGen, ChatGPT, and Descript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. This means individuals, even "children in dorm rooms," are already leveraging this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

This moment presents a "massive opportunity" for both new and established companies to optimize their advertising efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. However, this "arbitrage is fleeting" and may not work in a year or two, urging quick action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## Idea 2: AI X Generator (e.g., AI Infographic Generator)

This idea centers on creating AI-powered "generator" tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. The specific example given is an [[ai_startup_ideas_and_opportunities | AI infographic generator]], which has 9,000 searches per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. The exact match domain "AIinfographicgenerator.com" was available for $10, highlighting how early this market is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

The core premise is that AI excels at taking unstructured data and structuring it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. For an infographic generator, users could input a blog post, and the AI, using a predefined template, could extract key takeaways, generate paragraphs, and create related images with specified color schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

This concept applies to "any type of marketing activity that's a regular activity for like generating some type of visual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. The speaker guarantees revenue in the first month because it saves users significant time and money on graphic creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

The strategy here is not to invent something new, but to "remix" an existing activity using new AI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. This can disrupt existing apps and industries (e.g., combining a nutrition AI app with AI avatar generated content for distribution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. The key is to save time and money by offering a longtail solution to an established need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

Infographics are a proven service, with agencies doing millions in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. They boost engagement and sales, especially in B2B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. Owning an exact match domain like `AIinfographicgenerator.com` can create an organic funnel for traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

### Prioritizing Recurring Revenue

When considering [[ai_startup_ideas_and_incubation | AI startup ideas and incubation]], it's crucial to prioritize products that cater to *regular, recurring activities* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. Examples of good ideas are those used daily, monthly, or weekly (e.g., infographics, journaling), rather than one-time uses (e.g., logo generators, business plan generators) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. Businesses with recurring income are also more attractive for acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>.

## Idea 3: AI Journaling App

[[ai_startup_ideas_and_trends | AI journaling]] is another significant trend, with 8,100 searches per month and "going absolutely ballistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. People are looking for a phone application where they can simply speak, and the AI records, transcribes, summarizes, looks for insights, tracks habits, and allows querying of past entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

Journaling apps are highly retentive; once a user builds a history with an app, they are unlikely to switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. This creates a long-term customer relationship, similar to how beauty companies target young users for decades of product use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.

### Acquisition Strategy

For an AI journaling app, acquisition could involve:

*   **Longtail SEO:** Target longtail keywords related to [[ai_startup_ideas_and_trends | AI journaling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.
*   **Influencer Marketing:** Reach out to the "journaling aesthetics" subculture on YouTube and TikTok. Offer sponsored posts ($200 per video for 3 videos to start) combined with an affiliate commission (20-30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. Repeat exposure (around three videos) tends to build trust and increase conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.

## Idea 4: The New Creator Business Model

This idea focuses on a refined [[ai_startup_business_model | business model]] for creators, aiming to move beyond single-channel monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

The model consists of a flywheel:

1.  **Short-Form Content:** Create broad, top-of-funnel short-form content to attract a wide audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.
2.  **Lead Magnet:** Drive traffic to a valuable downloadable asset (lead magnet) specific to the audience's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
3.  **Email Newsletter:** Use the lead magnet to collect emails and build an email newsletter audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.
4.  **Long-Form Videos:** Create long-form YouTube videos that provide deeper dives into topics from the short-form content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>.
5.  **Cross-Promotion & Monetization:**
    *   Promote long-form videos through the email newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.
    *   Monetize long-form videos with multiple mid-roll ads (e.g., business content averaging $5-7 RPM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
    *   Secure brand deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
    *   Sell ads on the email newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
    *   Add calls to action in videos to subscribe to the newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.

This multi-faceted approach can lead to a "three quarters of a million to a million dollar a year type of company" for creators, achievable with a small team of VAs and a video editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.

### Community and Product Development

Further monetization and value creation can come from:

*   **Community:** Selling access to a community where like-minded individuals discuss their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>.
*   **Product Inception:** The community provides direct feedback on problems, essentially "paying you to tell you what product you should build them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.

This model fosters recurring revenue and builds valuable assets like an email newsletter (worth millions if it has a large, engaged, specific audience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. Newsletters are considered liquid assets, similar to real estate, with clear intrinsic value per subscriber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

## Idea 5: AI Receptionist

This idea highlights a significant market opportunity driven by increasing difficulty in hiring front-desk staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Search data shows a surge in interest for "AI receptionist," with longtail queries like "AI receptionists for dentists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

An AI receptionist can be trained on a company's data (e.g., a PDF of FAQs) to answer common questions and even perform tasks like scheduling appointments by plugging into CRM systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.

### Advantages

*   **Cost-Effective:** Cheaper than human receptionists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.
*   **Increased Effectiveness:** Can be more effective and knowledgeable due to consistent training and access to data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.
*   **Low Latency:** AI voice interfaces are now responsive enough to provide a good user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.
*   **Labor Replacement:** This trend represents how AI software is replacing labor, with receptionists being an early example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.
*   **Existing Tools:** Tools like Vapi offer APIs to manage inbound and outbound calls, enabling features like availability checks, bookings, FAQs, qualifying leads, and even debt collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>.

The advice is to "don't reinvent the wheel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>. Instead, find an existing, evergreen category and "remix" it with new AI technology to offer time and cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. This is a moment in time where consumer interest in AI is high, and new LLMs and APIs allow for easy experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.

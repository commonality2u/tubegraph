[[building_a_successful_vertical_saas_business | Vertical SaaS]] refers to software tailored for a specific industry. While it might seem "boring," it presents significant opportunities for [[building_and_scaling_tech_startups | building enduring and strong businesses]] [00:00:46]. Luke Sfinos, author of "The Vertical SAS Bible," is an expert in this domain, having built a multi-million dollar vertical SaaS business and advised Atomic, a venture studio that creates billion-dollar companies [00:00:22]. The approach to [[building_a_successful_vertical_saas_business | vertical SaaS]] is considered more scientific and mathematical than artistic [00:04:32].

## Why Vertical SaaS?

Historically, software was created to optimize businesses, enhance efficiency, reduce costs, save time, and boost revenue [00:01:57]. In the past 10-15 years, many founders shifted away from industry-specific software to pursue broader, multi-billion dollar opportunities, which often led to more failures [00:02:13]. [[building_a_successful_vertical_saas_business | Vertical SaaS]] offers the chance to build enduring businesses with strong customer retention, even if their growth rates don't always meet venture capital expectations [00:03:33].

## The Scientific Approach to Building a Vertical SaaS Business

### Step 1: Pick an Industry, Not an Idea
The foundational step is to select an industry rather than starting with a software idea [00:05:37].
Key characteristics that make an industry a good [[ai_saas_startup_opportunities | opportunity]] for [[building_a_successful_vertical_saas_business | vertical SaaS]] include:
*   **Industry Size (Revenue)**: Assess the total revenue generated by companies within the industry [00:06:15].
*   **Number of Companies**: Identify how many businesses operate in that industry [00:06:35]. Industries with fewer companies (e.g., General Medical and Surgical Hospitals with 2,500 companies) tend to be enterprise-driven, requiring extensive features and making sales difficult for bootstrapped startups [00:06:42].
*   **Segmentation**: The ideal market has a healthy mix of small businesses (a few million dollars in revenue), mid-market businesses ($10-$100 million in revenue), and enterprise businesses (over $100 million in revenue) [00:07:31]. It's easier to start with small to mid-sized businesses, as they require less product complexity and allow for gradual feature expansion [00:07:56].

> [00:08:20] "It's how big is it and what's the particular segmentation."

For example, machine shops are an attractive industry because they generate $240 billion in revenue, have 22,000 businesses, and are beautifully segmented across small, mid-market, and enterprise sizes [00:09:50]. While domain expertise is helpful, it's not a prerequisite for success; Luke Sfinos built a major vertical SaaS in trade schools without prior industry knowledge [00:11:09].

### Step 2: Map the Customer Journey and Operations
To deeply understand an industry, founders must map out the entire customer journey and end-to-end operations of its businesses [00:12:55]. This helps identify specific areas for software development.
*   **Example: Toast (Restaurant Software)**: Toast's S1 filing visualized every aspect of restaurant operations, from back office to kitchen, delivery, and marketing, to identify software opportunities [00:12:38].
*   **Example: Corsky (Trade School Software)**: The operations of a trade school involve admissions, training (often hands-on in a garage setting), IT, student services, compliance, and job placement [00:13:31]. Visualizing these processes reveals where software can introduce efficiencies [00:14:06].
*   This mapping process helps shift thinking from a software perspective to an industry-centric one, similar to "unbundling" a large platform like Craigslist or Reddit to find niche opportunities [00:14:19].

### Step 3: Analyze P&Ls and Follow the Money
Gaining access to Profit and Loss (P&L) statements from multiple businesses within the target industry is crucial [00:16:46].
*   **Sources**: Publicly traded companies in the space or industry-focused bankers are excellent resources for P&L data [00:17:01].
*   **Purpose**: P&Ls reveal where companies spend their money, allowing founders to identify areas where software can:
    1.  Increase Revenue [00:17:34]
    2.  Decrease Costs [00:17:36]
    3.  Prevent Customer Churn [00:17:41]
    4.  Maintain Compliance (especially in highly regulated industries) [00:17:44]

By understanding existing expenses, particularly those related to people or inefficient processes, founders can design solutions that address critical financial challenges [00:18:10].

### Step 4: Study the Competition
Investigate existing software solutions in the market, going beyond simple Google searches [00:20:59].
Common competitive landscapes include:
*   **Legacy Providers**: Old, comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems that handle many functions but might be outdated or cumbersome [00:19:35].
*   **Fragmented Horizontal Solutions**: Businesses piecing together general-purpose software (e.g., generic CRMs, project management tools like Trello/Asana, spreadsheets) that are not industry-specific [00:20:01]. This indicates a strong demand for an all-in-one vertical solution [00:20:35].
*   **Paper Processes**: Surprisingly, many industries still rely on manual, paper-based workflows in 2024, presenting clear opportunities for digitization [00:20:46].

> [00:21:06] "You have to look at each of these buckets and understand like what are they actually doing in each of these key areas."

**Role of AI in Research**: While AI tools like ChatGPT can assist with high-level market research, revenue size, and segmentation, they are less effective at detailing specific operational workflows or identifying niche, paper-based processes [00:23:05]. However, AI can generate lists of prevalent software solutions and suggest areas where AI itself could be leveraged (e.g., predictive maintenance, automated quality control) [00:27:01].

### Step 5: Understand Go-to-Market (GTM)
Before investing significant time, founders must be comfortable with the industry's distribution channels [00:35:23].
*   **Product without Users**: A great product is useless without effective distribution [00:35:41].
*   **Study Successful Vertical SaaS Companies**: Research how existing successful vertical SaaS companies in similar industries acquired their first 10, 100, and 1,000 customers [00:35:53].
*   **Sales-Led vs. Product-Led/Marketing-Led**: Many traditional vertical industries have "country clubby" sales models requiring heavy outside sales and relationship-building [00:36:24]. Venture capitalists often prefer product-led or marketing-led [[marketing_strategies_for_saas_apps | customer acquisition]] due to faster scaling [00:37:09]. Sales-led motions typically require very high Average Contract Values (ACVs) to build large companies [00:37:32].
*   **Media and Social**: Evaluate if media creation (e.g., newsletters, social media for niche communities) can be an effective, innovative GTM strategy for the chosen industry [00:38:40].

### Step 6: Develop a "Wedge Product"
A wedge product is an initial, easy-to-implement product designed to "get in the door" [00:40:24].
*   **Goal**: The ultimate goal in [[building_a_successful_vertical_saas_business | vertical SaaS]] is to become the all-in-one solution, but no one starts there [00:40:37].
*   **Characteristics of a Good Wedge Product**:
    *   Addresses a critical customer pain point, often currently handled by paper or poor competition [00:41:17].
    *   Easy to implement and deploy quickly (not a 12-month process) [00:41:30].
    *   Acts as a "reputation prover," building trust with the customer [00:41:40].
    *   Can leverage [[marketing_strategies_for_saas_apps | marketing-led customer acquisition]], even in sales-heavy industries [00:44:42].
*   **Example: Roofer.com**: This company, serving roofing businesses, started with a free proposal tool that used Google Maps to generate quick quotes [00:42:22]. This free tool provided value, enabled digital customer acquisition in a sales-heavy industry, and allowed Roofer.com to earn a percentage of bookings [00:43:34]. Once trust was established, they expanded into a CRM and other solutions, gradually becoming an all-in-one provider [00:44:20].

### Step 7: Incorporate Payments (Fintech Opportunity)
Owning the transaction flow is a key strategy for [[building_a_successful_ai_startup | building massive companies]] in [[building_a_successful_vertical_saas_business | vertical SaaS]] [00:46:35].
*   **Revenue Expansion**: Adding payment processing transforms the market size calculation. For example, if a software charges $10/month to 1 million restaurants, the market size is $120 million annually [00:47:09]. But if those restaurants generate $1 trillion in revenue and the software takes a small percentage of transactions, the market opportunity becomes significantly larger [00:47:48].
*   **Customer Convenience**: Integrating payments directly into the software provides a seamless experience for customers, making it much easier than using external, generic payment processors like PayPal [00:48:21]. This increases efficiency and reduces administrative burden for the businesses [00:48:51].
*   The [[role_of_ai_and_payments_in_vertical_saas | payments]] opportunity is often not a wedge product itself but can be captured once a solid wedge is established and trust is built [00:49:16].

### Step 8: Pricing Strategy
Pricing in software is often overlooked but is critical [00:49:42].
*   **Value-Based Pricing**: Understand the cost or value of the problem being solved for the customer [00:50:01].
*   **Calculate ROI**: Price the product based on the tangible return on investment (ROI) it provides. If a solution saves a school five students from dropping out, and each student's tuition is $20,000, the product's value is $100,000. The software can then be priced as a portion of that saved revenue (e.g., 20-50%) [00:51:01].
*   **Focus on Clear ROI**: Prioritize building products that clearly:
    *   Increase Revenue [00:52:28]
    *   Decrease Costs [00:52:28]
    *   Prevent Customer Churn [00:52:32]
    *   Ensure Compliance [00:52:35]
    These areas provide measurable ROI, making it easier to justify pricing and sell the solution [00:52:36].

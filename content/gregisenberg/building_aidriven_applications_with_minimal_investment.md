From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Blake Anderson, a 23-year-old entrepreneur, has successfully founded an [[AIpowered mobile apps and startups | AI mobile app studio]] that has achieved an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $15 million, primarily through bootstrapping mobile apps and using TikTok for growth hacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. His apps, including Riz GPT (now Plug AI), Umax, and Cal AI, have collectively garnered millions of downloads and significant monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Rise of AI Mobile Apps

The current landscape for [[aidriven_startup_ideas_and_entrepreneurship | AI-driven startup ideas and entrepreneurship]] offers a unique intersection of new AI functionality and novel distribution tactics, largely pioneered by e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This environment has enabled a small group of young entrepreneurs (18-22 years old) to lead the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Minimal Development Costs

AI significantly reduces the barriers to entry for developing complex applications. For instance, Umax, a facial analysis and recommendation app, would have previously required substantial investment in proprietary machine learning models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. However, by leveraging AI, specifically GPT Vision, Blake was able to build it with essentially zero upfront development cost, apart from his own time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Key Benefits of AI in Applications

AI enables the delivery of:
*   **Personalized functionality** that can be updated in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Technologies** that previously incurred high development costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   A **10x improvement in end-user experience** as AI advances and more complex applications are built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Blake Anderson's Framework for Building Viral AI Apps

This framework emphasizes building apps that redefine user value, rather than just leveraging virality for short-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Idea Generation & Validation

The process focuses on identifying archaic or challenging industries that can be simplified with AI, while also considering their viral potential on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

#### Career AI
This concept aims to be an all-in-one integrated platform for career advancement, consolidating fragmented tools like resume analysis, personality-based career quizzes, and job application courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. It could offer high functionality (resume analysis) made viral through features like a six-factor rating system and social media trends around career recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Pricing could be around $50 a month for the comprehensive tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

#### Journal AI
Positioned as an "AI second brain," this app would provide analysis for productivity, emotional support, and relationship insights based on user journaling entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. It would be essentially a ChatGPT backend with complex memory storage and a journaling-conducive UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. The core thesis is that AI can offer intricate, objective analysis that traditional journals lack, appealing to users who already use AI for personal reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

#### Language AI/Tutoring
This application would compete with existing platforms like Duolingo by integrating the newest AI functionality for dynamic learning, unlike the generally static modules found elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. While AI voice models are currently expensive, the expectation is that costs will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. The strategy is not to reinvent the wheel but to capture a small percentage of the market by offering better AI-driven learning and novel distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

### Distribution Strategy

Distribution is highly iterative and focused on maximizing virality.

#### Engaging in Iterative Virality
Avoid putting all efforts into one trendy viral method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Instead, continuously generate new hooks, refine product positioning for different audiences, and split test these approaches across various platforms and creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Track views, conversion rates, and engagement to inform future distribution strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

#### Influencer Marketing & Relationship Building
Direct engagement and developing personal relationships with influencers are key, rather than relying on marketplaces or agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Influencers receive numerous solicitations, so building trust and relationships helps differentiate serious companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Early on, prioritize both quantity (reaching out to thousands) and quality (treating them well, becoming friends) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Product Development

The development process is also tailored to maximize viral potential and user experience.

#### Engineering Around Virality
Design features and functionality to inherently drive social media engagement. For example, Umax's viral success was driven by its "six-factor Madden rating system" for facial analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This approach informs the initial design choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

#### Design Process
Start with wireframes, then hire a professional designer or use platforms like Upwork to convert them into fleshed-out UI designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

#### Coding with AI Tools
For those without capital or a CTO, [[considerations_for_learning_to_code_using_aidriven_tools_like_codeex | AI-driven tools like ChatGPT]] can teach coding skills. Blake learned Swift UI and used ChatGPT to generate code for Riz GPT and the first version of Umax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. He now uses Cursor with React Native <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This approach enables rapid iteration and solo development.

### Monetization: Pricing and Paywalls

Blake uses Superwall for paywall management, praising its split-testing capabilities and data provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

*   **Pricing Strategy:** Blake advocates for optimizing for the number of users (raised to a power greater than one) multiplied by profit per user, rather than just number of users multiplied by profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. This means accepting a potentially lower lifetime value (LTV) per download in exchange for greater user volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.
*   **Market Domination:** Maximizing user base allows for quicker market domination and increased word-of-mouth, which is often difficult to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
*   **Paywall Implementation:** The standard and most efficient practice is to guide users through an onboarding flow (e.g., quizzes, personal information requests) and then present the paywall at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. While not always ideal morally, it leverages the time users have already invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.

## Naming Strategy for AI Apps

Appending "AI" to an app name can be valuable when innovating in a relatively stagnant industry, as seen with Cal AI in calorie tracking, where it implies sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. However, it should be avoided in fields where 100% accuracy is critical (e.g., medical services), as "AI" might cause skepticism or concern about potential errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. Simpler, more friendly names like "Juny" or "Journey" might also be considered for certain apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

## Competing with Incumbents

When facing large existing players like MyFitnessPal or Duolingo, the strategy is that incumbents often don't work as hard, and their internal incentives are not as aligned for rapid iteration as those of a nimble startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>. By offering slightly better AI functionality and pioneering new marketing approaches, a startup can capture even a small percentage of a large market and build a significant product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Many potential users of [[successful_ai_applications_and_startups | new AI apps]] are not currently using the incumbent products, representing new market share rather than direct competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>.

## How to Come Up with More AI App Ideas

*   **Deliberate Scrolling & Feed Curation:** Actively curate social media feeds (e.g., use burner accounts) around areas of interest to immerse oneself in the content and user mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.
*   **Observing Everyday Life:** Many successful ideas are "obvious" concepts (calorie tracking, language learning, journaling) that exist in everyday life, to which an AI twist can be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.
*   **Focus on MVPs:** Build small Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) rather than trying to "boil the ocean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.
*   **Sensor Tower:** Use tools like Sensor Tower to assess the market size and other players in a given space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.
*   **Reflection:** Engage in activities like hiking to think clearly and generate ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.

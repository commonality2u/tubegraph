The concept of "a blog and a newsletter in a box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> aims to simplify the process of setting up and managing an online presence for individuals or businesses. This idea, proposed by Danny Grant, focuses on providing an easy-to-use solution for content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## The Core Idea

The core idea is to help individuals easily set up their own blog and newsletter, similar to how Fred Wilson's "avc.com" operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Fred Wilson's blog and newsletter have been active for at least 15-20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a> and were originally hosted on Tumblr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Comparison to Existing Platforms

While platforms like Substack already exist, they are primarily "newsletter first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. The speaker expresses reservations about building a new platform from scratch to compete directly with services that have raised significant capital, often tens or hundreds of millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Preferred Business Model: Agency Approach

Instead of creating a new proprietary platform, a more viable approach is to operate as an agency that helps users get set up on existing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

[!TIP] This service would involve working with established platforms such as:
*   Behive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>
*   Substack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>
*   WordPress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>

The service would charge a "very small one-time fee" for setup, making it an easy decision for potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

To acquire customers for such a service, a [[Growth strategies for increasing newsletter subscribers | cold outbound]] strategy (cold email, cold DM) could be employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

[!NOTE] The outreach message could highlight:
*   What the target is missing out on by not having a blog and newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   [[Monetizing through B2B newsletters for short form creators | Social proof]] by mentioning successful creators like Lenny Rachitsky, who built a multi-million dollar business with a free Substack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   Content marketing that discusses "how to build an audience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, funneling interested parties to the one-time offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

This type of business could be started as a side venture due to its relatively low starting costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

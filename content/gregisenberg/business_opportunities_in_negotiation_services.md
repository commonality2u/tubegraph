Negotiation is highlighted as a critical skill for entrepreneurs, capable of saving substantial amounts of money. Many believe that the "price is the price," but often, asking for a discount can lead to significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. This principle applies to a wide range of purchases, from office furniture and vendor contracts to software and bulk supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

## The Problem with Internal Negotiation

As a company grows, delegating negotiation becomes a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. Employees often lack the incentive or desire to engage in the negotiation process for several reasons:
*   **Awkwardness and discomfort** It can be an uncomfortable process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.
*   **Time-consuming** Negotiations can slow down procurement, sometimes taking weeks to finalize a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of incentive** Employees may not see the personal benefit in saving the company a few thousand dollars, as it only translates to a small increase in their bonus, if any <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
*   **Training difficulties** Despite efforts to train staff with negotiation books or AI tools like GPT bots, adoption remains low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

## The Solution: External Negotiation Services

A significant business opportunity exists in providing outsourced negotiation services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. This model addresses the challenges of internal negotiation by professionalizing the process.

>[!example] Tech Source
>Tech Source is a company that negotiates software contracts on behalf of businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. They evaluate existing usage and seat counts for enterprise software like Amazon S3, HubSpot, and Rippling, then negotiate procurement, leading to substantial savings (e.g., 60-70% for major vendors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

This concept can be expanded beyond software to "everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>, including:
*   Houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>
*   Cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>
*   Any large purchase where the asking price may not be firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>

## Business Model and Market Opportunity

The ideal business model for negotiation services is commission-based. For instance, a service could take 20% or 25% of the savings achieved below a certain asking price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. This aligns incentives between the service provider and the client.

This business is particularly timely because many companies are actively seeking to reduce costs, meaning the service is "swimming downstream" with current market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

### Key Success Factors

*   **Love for negotiation** The person leading the business should genuinely enjoy negotiating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.
*   **Salesforce training** A salesforce can be trained to handle negotiations, potentially leveraging talent from regions like the Philippines or Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.
*   **Incentive alignment** Hyper-incentivizing and aligning the salesforce with the client's savings goals is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.
*   **AI assistance** Utilizing large language models (LLMs) can assist the salesforce in drafting and rewriting negotiation emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. This represents an opportunity for [[Voice AI in Business Negotiations | Voice AI in Business Negotiations]] to streamline communications.
*   **Price discovery expertise** Understanding that prices are not always firm and knowing how to ask the right questions to determine flexibility are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

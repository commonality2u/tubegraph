The concept of social interaction has evolved, with a growing demand for [[virtual_social_experiences_and_apps | virtual social experiences and apps]] that prioritize privacy and genuine connection over mass broadcasting. This exploration delves into ideas for new social platforms, drawing inspiration from past successes and current user behaviors, particularly in the realm of travel and shared memories.

## The Need for Private Social Networks

There is a perceived gap in the market for a simple, focused social network that facilitates connections among close friends [00:19:50]. The shift in demographics, with friends often living in different cities, highlights a desire to know when close contacts might be overlapping in the same location to arrange meetups [00:20:12].

Current platforms like Instagram have seen their "status updates" primarily used by users to indicate their current city, suggesting an unmet need for simple location sharing among friends [00:20:38]. While Apple's "Find My Friends" offers basic location sharing, it lacks depth as a social network [00:21:16]. An ideal app would allow users to push a button to automatically update their location, presenting a feed that shows friends based on proximity, sparking conversations and meetups [00:21:28].

## The Path Model: A Blueprint for Intimate Networks

A key inspiration for a new private social network is "Path," a platform from about 10 to 12 years ago [00:21:51]. Path's core premise was a privatized, closed social network exclusively for close friends and family, typically limiting connections to around 75 to 150 friends [00:22:07]. This limit was notably based on Dunbar's number, a sociology theory suggesting humans can only maintain around 150 meaningful connections at once [00:24:55].

Path was considered the "anti-version" of the sprawling social networks prevalent at the time, which encouraged hundreds or thousands of connections [00:25:27]. Despite its eventual acquisition by Google for approximately $100 million [00:25:33], the desire for a Path-like experience has persisted [00:22:34].

[[building_a_social_app_with_ai | Building a social app with AI]] has become more feasible, as AI can expedite product creation, reducing the need for multi-million dollar investments and large teams for beta testing [00:24:21].

A potential new social network could be branded "Dunbar," directly referencing the theory behind its limited network size [00:26:01]. Such an app could leverage PR by appealing to the sentiment that traditional social media is "ruining lives," positioning itself as a healthier alternative [00:26:24].

[!WARNING|Building Consumer Social Products]
Building consumer social products is notoriously difficult due to the challenge of achieving network effects [00:27:00]. If a user's friends are not on the app, the value proposition diminishes [00:27:29]. The app needs to encourage user contribution to spark conversations and foster engagement, rather than just passive consumption [00:28:17].

## Nostalgia and Shared Memories: Time Capsules

A third idea revolves around creating "time capsules of shared memories" [00:34:44]. Many people find themselves looking through old photos on their devices, getting lost in memories [00:34:19]. Shared photo albums, while useful, often become places "where your memories go to die," as they aren't frequently revisited [00:34:37].

The concept is to share a physical "Time Capsule" of memories with friends from trips or shared experiences [00:34:50]. This could be a highly personal and "high-touch" gift [00:35:48]. For this to work and prevent obligation, it must be ephemeral, allowing the recipient to experience it and then discard it if desired after a short period [00:35:52].

This idea draws inspiration from "Clout," a social network from around 2013 that capitalized on nostalgia [00:36:37]. Clout would connect to users' various social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and send reminders of past memories before Facebook had its own "Memories" feature [00:36:49]. Clout succeeded by tapping into the human love for nostalgia, making people inclined to share these reminders with friends, thus going viral [00:37:47]. However, it ultimately failed to sustain itself because users would primarily come to Clout to see memories and then share them on other platforms with stronger network effects [00:38:09].

[!INFO|Human Behavior]
Human needs generally do not change; instead, the products and consumption methods evolve [00:39:09]. Nostalgia is a powerful driver, and platforms that can effectively evoke it have strong potential [00:39:26]. An app that sits "between a photo sent in a text thread and a digital album on your nightstand" could fill a current void in how memories are shared and preserved [00:40:30].

## Monetization and Growth

Monetization for a Path-like app could involve selling "sticker packs" or charging a small annual subscription fee, such as $20-$30 per year, which people would be willing to pay if a strong network effect is achieved [00:31:42]. This model allows for bootstrapping the business [00:32:02].

In the future, with the rise of AI, a potential monetization model for social apps could involve users opting to commit their anonymized personal data to train large language models for a premium subscription, replacing traditional SaaS models [00:33:09].

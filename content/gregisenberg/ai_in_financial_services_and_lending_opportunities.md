The traditional lending industry is characterized by lengthy processes, with obtaining a loan from a bank or private credit often taking weeks to get a call and months to process documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>. This antiquated approach involves manual compilation and review of financial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.

## AI-Based Lending

[[AI apps and AI startups | AI]] and large language models (LLMs) present a significant opportunity to revolutionize the lending process by automating due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

### Process Outline
An [[opportunities_for_ai_consulting_and_agency_services | AI-based lending]] system could:
*   **Target specific verticals:** Focus on niches like SaaS companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.
*   **Automate information gathering:**
    *   Ask applicants specific questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.
    *   Link to financial APIs, such as Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>.
    *   Facilitate secure uploads of identification and corporate documents (e.g., Articles of Incorporation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>.
    *   Automate all diligence steps, packaging the information for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.
*   **Maintain human oversight:** A human would still be involved to verify information and ensure there is nothing illicit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.

This approach could enable a $5 million loan to be processed in as little as 48 hours, significantly streamlining a traditionally slow industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.

## Bank of Vibe Coding: A Specialized AI Lending Model

Inspired by Sahil Lini's public offer of $100,000 for 10% profit from [[ai_startup_ideas_and_opportunities | Vibe coders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>, the "Bank of Vibe Coding" is proposed as an [[opportunities_for_ai_consulting_and_agency_services | AI lending]] LLM designed for [[ai_startup_ideas_and_opportunities | Vibe coders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.

### Proposed Model
This model would:
*   **Assess candidates:** Use an LLM to evaluate criteria such as previous successful projects, social media influence (e.g., over 10,000 followers on X), and project viability (e.g., Stripe integration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.
*   **Profit sharing:** Take a percentage of the profits from successful projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

This concept leverages [[using_ai_to_build_a_saas_startup | AI]] to automate administrative tasks, making it feasible to manage a large portfolio of small, high-potential investments that would otherwise be an "administrative nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.

## The Challenge of Easy-to-Start Businesses
While [[opportunities_in_ai_for_startups_and_creatives | AI]] makes it easier than ever to start a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>, particularly in the realm of [[ai_apps_and_ai_startups | AI apps]], these are often the "worst businesses" because they are easy to copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This leads to rapid market saturation and price erosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Businesses like Cal AI, despite being initially impressive, face the challenge of numerous competitors appearing quickly, driving down pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.# AI in Financial Services and Lending Opportunities

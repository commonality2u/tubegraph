[[Utilizing AI for writing and content creation | AI tools]] like [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT 4o]] are transforming ad creation, offering the potential to significantly boost Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and business profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Jacob Posel, an expert in creating winning visual content with [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT 4o]], demonstrates how to generate high-quality ads in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

## Core Principles for Ad Creation with ChatGPT 4o

### Importance of Inspiration Images
Unlike other image models (e.g., Midjourney, Flux, Ideogram), [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT 4o]] is a multimodal language model, meaning prompting is less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. It has a strong understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The most crucial elements for creating effective ads are providing inspiration images and product images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

For instance, a simple prompt like "add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" can yield excellent results when combined with a reference ad and a product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### When to Use Reference Images
[[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT 4o]] has a good understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge Wallets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. For such established brands, you may not need a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. However, for relatively new or small products with limited online presence, always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

### Experimentation at Scale
AI allows for rapid experimentation, which is key to finding ads that convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. You can quickly generate variations for different audiences (men, women, old, young, diverse complexions) to see what performs best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. This capability enables [[using_ai_to_scale_and_automate_marketing_tasks | marketers]] to scale and automate marketing tasks, producing potentially hundreds of ads in minutes when the API becomes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

## Optimizing Prompting for Visuals

### Keywords for Photo Realism
Using keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" is crucial for generating photorealistic images, preventing the model from defaulting to cartoonish styles or strange colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

### Specifying Fonts and Aspect Ratios
For well-known fonts, [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT 4o]] has a decent understanding due to its exposure to internet content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. You can specify font types (e.g., "font type exo2 bold italic") and aspect ratios in your prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. The model usually defaults to 9:16 but can be instructed for 1:1 or other ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:54:00">[37:54:00]</a>.

## Best Practices for Prompting
[[Best practices for prompting ChatGPT for ad creation | When prompting]], it's important to be clear and direct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. Additionally:

*   **Start a New Chat for Adjustments**: If the initial prompt doesn't yield desired results, start a new chat for adjustments instead of continuing in the same conversation. This prevents the model from using a flawed AI-generated image as its new reference, which can lead to progressively worse results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>. New chats maintain consistency while incorporating improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:10]</a>.
*   **Specify "Generate the Image"**: To ensure the model consistently produces image results rather than text descriptions of the ad, include "generate the image" in your prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>.
*   **Specify Language**: Explicitly prompt it to write in English to avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>.

## Inspiration Sources for Ads
*   **Sora Explore Page**: Sora, which uses the same underlying model as [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT 4o]], offers an "explore page" where users can view images and the exact prompts used to create them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. This is an excellent resource for understanding effective prompts, ideation, and discovering new aesthetic approaches not yet saturated in your niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. Sora also has less strict policy guidelines than other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.
*   **Meta Ad Library Tools**: Services like Creative OS, ForPlay, and icon.me aggregate and tag ads from Meta's Ad Library, making it easier to search for inspiration and templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>. This means that while it feels "dirty" to replicate another company's ad, this process of seeking inspiration and using templates is already common practice in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.

## Live Ad Creation Example: LCA
A live demonstration of creating an ad for "LCA," a design agency for the [[generating_content_with_ai_tools | AI age]], showcased the iterative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>.

1.  **Objective**: Create a luxury-style digital ad for LCA, which works with a small number of top-tier companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Inspiration**: Screenshots of LCA's website (for branding, typography, and client logos) and a vintage Rolex ad (to convey luxury) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>.
3.  **Initial Prompt**: "Generate a digital ad for LCA [latecheckout.agency]. LCA is a SWAT team/design agency only for the most interesting brands on the planet helping them with building AI first tools. It only works with the best companies. I have provided some screenshots from their website for you to use as inspiration in the ad as well as a reference vintage Rolex ad as inspiration. Use this to capture the luxury vibe of the company. Generate the image." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>
4.  **First Result**: The ad generated a man pointing with a background reminiscent of the Rolex ad, but it included a Rolex watch on his wrist, and the copy was "Leaders at billion dollar brands choose LCA to define their future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>. The logo and typography were well-integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:00">[31:11:00]</a>.
5.  **Refinement (New Chat)**: To remove the watch and incorporate client logos, a new chat was started. The prompt was refined: "Rather than generating a watch, show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>.
6.  **Second Result**: The man was no longer pointing but showing his fist, with the LCA logo and a subheading. The ad successfully integrated logos of major companies like Dropbox, Salesforce, and a surprising inclusion of Disney (which LCA had not worked with, highlighting a potential "hallucination" or creative liberty by the AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:00">[39:00:00]</a>. Despite this, the ad achieved the desired luxury feel and digital style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:51:00">[39:51:00]</a>.

While not always a "one-shot" process, especially with less strict prompts, [[utilizing_ai_for_marketing_strategies | AI for ad creation]] significantly shortens the time to value and sparks creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>.

## The Future of Ad Creation
[[Using AI tools for content creation | AI-powered ad creation]] leads to more personalized, entertaining, and timely ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>. Companies can leverage AI to create ads that respond to real-time news cycles or specific events (e.g., National Hot Dog Day, birthdays), which was previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>. AI can even monitor news feeds and automatically produce ads en masse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>. This capability allows for unprecedented levels of creativity and the ability to stand out in a crowded market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>.

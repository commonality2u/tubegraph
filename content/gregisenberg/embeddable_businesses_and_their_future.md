Greg Eisenberg highlights that [[building AI startups in 2025 | embeddable businesses]] are anticipated to be a significant trend in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. These businesses involve creating products that can be embedded directly onto other websites or platforms.

## What are Embeddable Businesses?

An embeddable business provides a component or service that website owners can integrate into their own sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. The core idea is to own "real estate" on another entity's digital property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

### Examples

*   **Offer Button**: Greg developed `offerbutton.com`, a free service that allows website owners to embed a button on their site. This button enables potential buyers to make an offer to acquire the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. This concept quickly gained traction, with 400 websites embedding the button, creating a directory of companies for sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.
*   **Form Builders**: Tools like Typeform are inherently embeddable, allowing users to integrate forms directly into their websites with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
*   **Product Hunt Badges**: Product Hunt allows successful products to display badges or "plaques" on their websites, signifying achievements like "Product of the Day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This concept could be expanded into a business where digital badges or physical plaques are sold to e-commerce brands or products for displaying credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Such a business could achieve high margins (e.g., 99%) by selling a digital image or a physical plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **Service Branding**: Many software services, such as Zero (invoicing) and Beehiiv (email newsletters), automatically include "sent with [Service Name]" branding at the bottom of their outputs. While often removable with a premium subscription, most users do not opt out, effectively marketing the service to recipients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. Gmail famously used "sent with Gmail" in its early invite-only phase to spread awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. Superhuman also utilizes this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.

## Advantages of Embeddable Businesses

Embeddable businesses offer several key benefits:

*   **Consistent Traffic**: By owning real estate on other websites, these businesses gain exposure to consistent traffic that their host sites naturally attract every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.
*   **Automatic Marketing & Credibility**: When embedded products display their branding (e.g., "sent with Superhuman"), they perform automatic marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. This strategy also leverages the authority of the host website, implicitly endorsing the embedded product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>. This aligns with the human desire for "status plays" or status symbols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.
*   **High Margin Potential**: Selling digital elements or badges can lead to extremely high-margin businesses, similar to the insurance industry where initial sales are almost pure profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:12]</a>.

## Aesthetics in Product Building

Aesthetic software, which prioritizes clean design and user experience, is seen as the "new wave" beyond "luxury software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. Daniel Dalen, whose father is an architect, emphasizes the importance of design and aesthetics in products and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>. A good aesthetic contributes significantly to the perceived value of a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>.

When building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), prioritizing aesthetics for the landing page is recommended to capture attention and clearly communicate value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>. Tools like Vercel and Framer AI can help create aesthetically pleasing landing pages quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:38:00">[27:38:00]</a>. While the product's core functionality should be paramount (like a car that drives) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>, aesthetics can be layered on later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>.

## Shopify Ecosystem and Embeddable Opportunities

The [[building and leveraging businesses within Shopify ecosystem | Shopify ecosystem]] presents vast opportunities for embeddable businesses. Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) e-commerce is a highly dynamic space with substantial capital flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:02:00">[45:02:00]</a>.

*   **Problem-Solving**: Businesses can identify specific pain points within the DTC supply chain, conversion rate optimization (CRO), or customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:39:00">[47:39:00]</a>.
*   **Examples of Shopify Apps**:
    *   **Instant.so**: An instant page builder that creates high-converting Shopify stores quickly using AI-generated Liquid components, demonstrating how [[building automated businesses with AI | AI-powered tools]] can enhance the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:44:00">[42:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:54:00">[42:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Last Mile Carrier Integration**: A Shopify app built to hide the China origin of shipments for D2C brands, improving customer experience by only showing local tracking links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:22:00">[44:22:00]</a>.

The ability to create highly specific solutions (niche down) within areas like CRO for local construction businesses, rather than competing with large players like Google or DocuSign, provides a stronger competitive moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:00">[50:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:50:00">[50:50:00]</a>. This approach can lead to [[micro_saas_business_ideas | high-margin, high-revenue generating products]] that justify subscription fees within the constant cash flow of DTC businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:25:00">[49:25:00]</a>.

## "Login with Influencer" Idea

A hypothetical concept of "log in with influencer" was proposed, where influential individuals could connect their social media profiles to e-commerce sites to potentially unlock lower price points or exclusive products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39:00">[32:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>. The intent was to leverage [[digital influencers as a business asset | social status]] for marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:18:00">[33:18:00]</a>.

However, this idea was deemed problematic due to potential negative impacts on conversion rates by creating a "dual class system" for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:28:00">[37:28:00]</a>. It could alienate the vast majority of non-influential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:26:00">[36:26:00]</a>. A more effective approach would be for brands to proactively identify and offer benefits to influencers privately, rather than publicly displaying an eligibility check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:50:00">[36:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04:00">[38:04:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of the "idea maze" in refining an initial insight into a viable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:17:00">[39:17:00]</a>.

David Park, founder of Jenny AI, grew his startup from zero to $10 million ARR using a comprehensive growth playbook that heavily features [[influencer_marketing_and_consumer_engagement | influencer marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach is considered one of the most effective for [[innovative_marketing_strategies_for_startups | AI startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## The Rise of "Fresh Accounts"

Traditional social media metrics like millions of followers or checkmarks are no longer the primary indicators of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Instead, "fresh accounts" — newly created accounts with few followers — can achieve viral reach immediately if their content resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

David Park emphasizes that a fresh account with 50 followers can outperform an account with 70,000 followers in terms of engagement and views, provided the content is high-quality and the hook is good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This phenomenon is particularly powerful for [[innovative_marketing_strategies_for_startups | AI startups]] because the product itself can be a "spectacle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Companies should prioritize sponsoring fresh accounts over established YouTubers with millions of subscribers, even if they have similar view counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This is because fresh accounts are often "juiced by the algorithm" and are on an upward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Moreover, fresh accounts charge significantly less for sponsorships, making the [[influencer_marketing_and_consumer_engagement | ROI]] much higher, as established creators tend to expect large fees (e.g., $20,000 for a 30-second video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Building Your Own Influencer Presence

Instead of just sponsoring new accounts, businesses can create their own fresh accounts, featuring a "face" that becomes the spokesperson for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This allows the company to control the content and avoid issues like creators feeling their main account is "polluted by ads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Case Study: Mang Mang Duck and Jenny AI

David Park collaborated with Mang Mang Duck, who had 300,000 followers on TikTok at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Jenny AI paid him $4,000 per month for 20 videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The account started from scratch and grew to 70,000 followers, generating half a billion views altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. In the first month, they achieved 7 million impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

This partnership had a good [[influencer_marketing_and_consumer_engagement | ROI]] because Mang Mang Duck's content (teaching people how to write emails, speak to bosses, etc.) aligned perfectly with Jenny AI's function as a writing tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The deal was initially for three months, offering consistent revenue for the creator while allowing the startup to test the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### The "Order of Virality" Playbook

To achieve viral growth with short-form content, follow this iterative strategy:
1.  **Farm Multiple Accounts**: Have multiple accounts on each platform (TikTok, Reels, Shorts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
2.  **Experiment Extensively**: Test tons of hooks, video ideas, and different content angles (skits, memes, humor, educational, straight ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Post at least one video per day to allow for rapid iteration and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.
3.  **Find a Viral Video**: Through experimentation, a video will eventually go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
4.  **Create a Viral Series**: Turn a successful viral video into a repeatable series by tweaking it slightly (e.g., changing the object used in an experiment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This minimizes effort while maximizing reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
5.  **Replicate Across Accounts**: Post the viral series on all multiple accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. At its peak, Jenny AI had seven different accounts on each platform, posting 24 videos daily, increasing the "surface area of luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
6.  **Translate for International Markets**: Recreate the same viral videos with creators who speak different languages (e.g., Chinese, Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.
7.  **Sponsor Reposts**: As the cycle matures, sponsor other pages (e.g., Instagram meme pages) to repost your viral content for a second life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.
8.  **Utilize for Paid Ads**: Use mega-viral content for [[consumer_marketing_strategies | paid ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
9.  **Return to Step One**: The cycle eventually ends when copycats proliferate and the audience gets bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

A key aspect is **Format Product Fit**: Going viral for the sake of it is "empty calories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. The viral series format must naturally integrate with the product, ensuring that viewers who resonate with the content are also potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. For Jenny AI, a series like "POV: You have a paper or essay due" generated over 300 million views and half a million dollars in revenue because it directly addressed a pain point the product solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

## Finding the Right Influencers

Identifying influencers whose audience genuinely aligns with your product is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.
*   **Ask Users Directly**: In user interviews, ask customers which influencers they follow, especially those related to your product's niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.
*   **Use "Suggest Similar Accounts"**: On platforms like Instagram, click on an influencer's profile and explore suggested similar accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.
*   **Algorithm Hack**: Create a new Instagram or TikTok account and manually follow a list of relevant influencers. Watch their videos all the way through, and the platform's algorithm will start suggesting other similar influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. This method helps discover "crazy deals" with emerging creators who have high potential for virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. If an influencer appears on your "For You Page" when you're not following them, it indicates their content has the capacity to be pushed to larger, non-follower audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

## Reaching Out to Influencers

When reaching out for [[influencer_reach_out_as_a_business_model | partnerships]]:
*   **All Avenues of Attack**: Utilize all available communication channels: DMs, emails, LinkedIn, and any other unique platforms or blogs they might have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. The harder it is to find their contact, the more impressed they might be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.
*   **Be Detailed, Tailored, and Concise**: Messages should show genuine interest in their content and explain why their audience would love your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. Avoid irrelevant details about funding rounds or employee numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.
*   **Indicate Paid Promotion**: Clearly state that it is a paid promotion to distinguish your offer from free product samples or subscriptions, which influencers rarely value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **Expect Low Response Rates**: Be prepared for a majority of messages not to receive a response, especially in the early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. Developing thick skin helps in optimizing outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.
*   **Leverage Common Ground**: Find personal connections or shared experiences with the influencer (e.g., same neighborhood, university) to increase response rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.

## Negotiating Deals

*   **Align Incentives**: Structure payments to ensure both parties want the video to convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. Avoid paying all money upfront to retain leverage, as some influencers might underperform or not post at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.
*   **Split Payments**: Pay a percentage upfront and link the rest to performance metrics like conversions (using personal coupon codes) or views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
*   **Be Transparent**: Be honest about your budget, target countries, and expected ROI for specific partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. Encourage influencers to be transparent about their demographics and past sponsored content performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.
*   **Negotiate from the Top Down**: Start by asking for the price of the most comprehensive package (e.g., link in bio, Instagram story, posts on all short-form accounts, full usage rights) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. Then, remove elements you don't need to arrive at a fairer price for a single video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. Once a base price is established, negotiate bulk deals (e.g., three videos per month with a discount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **Ignore Follower-Based Pricing**: Do not pay based on follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. This is a common misconception that leads to overpaying for limited [[digital_influencers_and_brand_engagement | brand engagement]] or [[influencer_marketing_and_consumer_engagement | ROI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

## Content Strategy for Influencer Collaborations

*   **Tailor to Influencer's Style**: Sponsored content should not deviate too much from the influencer's usual posts to maintain audience retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. If inexperienced, trust the influencer to create content similar to their successful posts, guiding them on where and how to integrate your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
*   **Integrate into Existing Series**: If an influencer has a popular series (e.g., "Top 10 AI tools that feel illegal to know"), ask to be included in that series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>. This leverages their proven content format.
*   **Scale and Automate**: To achieve a high volume of content (e.g., a video every few hours), it's impossible to micromanage every influencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. Provide clear blueprints (how the product should be spoken about, portrayed, expected views/engagement) and aim for "set and forget" package deals (e.g., four videos a month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>. This allows a small team to manage large budgets efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.
*   **Don't Fear Direct Ads**: While organic reach is important, do not be afraid of a video looking like a "straightup ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>. Even if it gets fewer views, a direct ad that clearly addresses a pain point and offers a solution will convert better because it targets people with high buying intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Scaling

Scaling [[influencer_marketing_and_consumer_engagement | influencer marketing]] requires a blend of managerial and creative skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. It's essential to efficiently manage numerous campaigns, track data to identify winning and losing influencers, and refine your mental model for future partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. Building genuine human relationships with creators is also vital to break through the noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

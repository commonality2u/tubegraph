[[Using AI to scale and automate marketing tasks | Marketing automation]] is shifting from complex, manual processes to simplified, AI-powered workflows. This approach, often referred to as "Vibe Marketing," leverages tools like MCP, NADN, and Claude to streamline and even replace traditional marketing team functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The goal is to automate repetitive, "boring" tasks, freeing up marketers to focus on more strategic and creative endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## The Power of Simple Workflows

Many believe that [[AI automation tools for workflows | automated workflows]] must be exceedingly complicated, often involving "a million different things happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. However, the most effective workflows are often the simplest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. For example, a task that might traditionally take two to three weeks of manual effort can be completed in approximately 30 minutes using these automated methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

Key benefits of adopting this approach include:
*   **Time Savings** Automating manual tasks allows marketers to get out of the weeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.
*   **Strategic Focus** Frees up time for strategic or creative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **New Business Opportunities** By understanding the arbitrage and insights from using AI tools, individuals can create new businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Actionable Insights** Provides a clear path forward for marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Core Platforms

While various platforms exist, Inate (NADN) and Gum Loop are frequently recommended for building these workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Inate is preferred by more advanced users due to its flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Building a Vibe Marketing Workflow: A Step-by-Step Approach

A typical workflow for organic growth and content creation can be broken down into distinct stages:

### 1. Identifying Demand Through Keyword Research

The initial step in [[building_aipowered_workflows_without_coding | building an AI-powered marketing workflow]] is to identify existing demand on the internet for a product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Keyword research is the most straightforward method for this, revealing what people are searching for, how often, and potential traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Traditional keyword research tools like Ahrefs and Semrush can be overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. However, this process can be automated using Claude with an MCP integration to a "keyword tool" built in NADN, which connects to Ahrefs' data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

**Example Keyword Research Output (for Beehive, a newsletter growth platform):**
*   **Keywords:** 42 relevant keywords identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Monthly Traffic:** 14,580 potential monthly traffic available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Competition:** Medium competition, indicating opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **High-Potential:** 20 specific high-potential keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Keyword Types:** Includes informational (e.g., "how to start my first newsletter") and commercial (e.g., "best newsletter platform") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Competitors:** Identifies current ranking competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Recommendations:** Provides insights on content types (e.g., comprehensive guides), competitive edge analysis, and traffic opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Actionable Steps:** For specific keywords, it suggests actions like creating in-depth guides, case studies, comparison content, and optimized landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

This automated process, leveraging Claude and a custom tool, can generate these insights in 30 seconds, a task that might manually take 20-40 hours for a non-expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### 2. Generating Content Ideas and Briefs

Once keywords are identified, the next step is to group them into relevant topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. For example, keywords related to "newsletter growth and audience building" could be clustered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

Claude can then be prompted to analyze search results (pages 1 and 2 of Google) for these keyword clusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. This analysis identifies gaps in existing competitor content, revealing areas where more value can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. For instance, current content might lack data-driven benchmarks or advanced segmentation strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

Based on these gaps, Claude can generate a "30-day content dashboard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. This dashboard outlines specific content pieces (e.g., blog posts) for each day, including:
*   Proposed content titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   Targeted keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
*   A detailed content brief (identifying content gaps, primary audience, and structure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

### 3. Automating Content Creation

Instead of manually writing content, the generated content brief can be copied and fed back into Claude, along with a specified brand voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Claude then writes a complete, search-optimized blog post based on the brief and brand guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. This significantly reduces the 20-30 hours typically spent on manual writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

The output from Claude is not "AI slop" because it's informed by real data and context, ensuring highly valuable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

### 4. Multi-Format and Multi-Channel Content

Modern organic growth requires multi-format and multi-channel content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. Competitors often focus solely on blog posts, leaving gaps for other content types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

The workflow can extend to generate:
*   **Images:** Integration with tools like ChatGPT's image generation allows Claude to create hero images based on the article content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.
*   **Video:** Video generation capabilities can also be integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   **Social Media Posts:** Claude can generate platform-specific content, such as X (formerly Twitter) threads, based on the blog post content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.

This ensures content is distributed across platforms like Reddit, LinkedIn, X, and YouTube, increasing discoverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

## The Role of MCP Integration

An **MCP (Multi-Channel Protocol) integration** acts like a "two-way radio" between an LLM (like Claude) and a third-party software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. It allows the LLM to:
*   Access data from external tools (e.g., Ahrefs data via NADN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.
*   Send commands or data back to the external software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

This seamless communication eliminates the need for marketers to switch between numerous tabs and tools, reducing "context switching" and saving significant time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

### Human-in-the-Loop for Brand Safety

While automation is powerful, a "human-in-the-loop" step is crucial for brand safety and quality control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. After a draft is generated in Claude, it can be sent to a platform like Slack for review by a marketing or social media manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. This allows for editing, formatting adjustments, and ensures the content aligns with brand voice and standards before final publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

## The Future of [[AI agents and automated marketing workflows | Automated Workflows]]

The vision for these workflows is fully automated, end-to-end systems where users input a URL, and the system automatically identifies keywords, creates cross-platform content, and publishes it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>. This represents significant [[opportunities_in_automated_workflow_platforms | opportunities in automated workflow platforms]] for businesses.

For those interested in learning more or implementing these strategies, communities like the Vibe Marketing community (with over 2,500 members across School and Slack) offer shared workflows and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>.

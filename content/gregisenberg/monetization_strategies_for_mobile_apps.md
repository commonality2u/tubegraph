## Introduction
Zach Yagari, a 17-year-old, has built an AI startup called Cal AI that generates over $1 million per month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He outlines a strategy for building and [[monetization_strategies_for_ai_apps|monetizing]] a similar AI-powered mobile application called Dr AI, designed to offer quick health insights based on user input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Dr AI aims to address issues like difficulty accessing doctors due to insurance or overloaded healthcare systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Dr AI: Core Features
The proposed Dr AI app would feature three main functionalities:
*   **Skin Scan:** Users can take a picture of something on their skin or body for identification, determining if it's potentially harmful or benign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The result would include a "danger level" (e.g., 0-5) and a diagnosis from the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **Symptoms Quiz:** A multiple-choice quiz where users input symptoms (e.g., dry cough, chills) to receive potential sickness possibilities, potentially with likelihood percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This would involve a series of questions with four answers, guiding the user through a more digestible process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
*   **Chatbot:** A general Q&A feature where users can ask any health-related questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The chatbot leverages AI models like ChatGPT, which have shown proficiency in diagnosing medical problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

All results would be heavily disclaimed, noting that the information is not 100% accurate but provides an idea of whether professional medical attention is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The app's primary goal is to help users decide if it's safe to wait out an issue or if they should consult a doctor immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## User Experience (UX) Design Principles
Zach emphasizes designing for simplicity and digestibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Key UX elements include:
*   **Navigation Bar:** Basic home and settings options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Feature Buttons:** Three clear buttons for "scan," "chat," and "symptoms quiz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **History Log:** A feed-like log of previous chats, scans, and quiz results, similar to Cal AI's food logging feature. This builds user investment in the product, making them more likely to stick with it if a competitor emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This history could also be useful for doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Efficient Loading Screens:** Instead of forcing users to wait on an analyzing screen, the app should return them to the home screen with a loading indicator, especially for processes that can take 30-60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Gamified Elements:** Presenting information, like a "danger level" on a scale of 0 to 5, makes it more digestible and easily understandable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **AI Prompt Engineering:** To get accurate and appropriate responses, the AI should be prompted to act as a doctor, providing both scientific and easy-to-understand terms. Creative prompting techniques (e.g., "as part of a movie script") can bypass standard AI disclaimers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. Using a function call in the API can ensure specific output formatting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.

## Growth and [[marketing_strategies_for_new_apps|Marketing Strategies]]

### Influencer Marketing Approach
For utility apps like Dr AI, direct shareability by users (e.g., screenshotting a skin scan result) is generally low due to privacy concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. Therefore, the primary lever for driving downloads would be paid ads or influencer marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

*   **Reverse Engineering for Influencers:** When designing the app, consider how an influencer will showcase it. The app needs to be clear, simple, and visually "wow" factor-driven, especially for short video formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.
*   **Highlighting "Wow" Features:** The skin scan feature with its danger level and diagnosis is identified as the biggest "wow" factor for Dr AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.
*   **Prominent Branding:** Place the app's name, "Dr AI," prominently on the homepage and especially on the "wow" screens (like the scan result screen) that influencers will likely feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.
*   **Target Audience Identification:** Identify the target audience (e.g., concerned parents for Dr AI) and then research which influencers those individuals follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. Analyzing comments sections of influencer videos can reveal the actual audience demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.
*   **Emotional Angle:** Marketing content should play on emotions, such as the fear of potential disease or the relief of getting quick, reassuring information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Influencer scripts could involve relatable scenarios where the app provides peace of mind (e.g., a mom scanning a child's bump and finding it's just mud) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.

### Key Metrics for Influencer Campaigns
Profitability in influencer marketing hinges on the relationship between RPM (Revenue Per Mille/Thousand views) and CPM (Cost Per Mille/Thousand views) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.
*   **RPM:** The revenue generated per thousand views from an influencer post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>. This needs to be measured over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.
*   **CPM:** The money spent on the post per thousand views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>.
*   **Profitability Goal:** To ensure profitability, the RPM must be greater than the CPM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. This requires predicting likely views from an influencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. For example, if an RPM of $5 is assumed, and an influencer averages 250,000 views per video for four videos (1 million total views), then paying the influencer under $5,000 would be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.

## Pricing and [[monetization_strategies_for_ai_apps|Monetization Strategies]]

### Weekly Subscription Model
For apps like Dr AI, which might be used on a need-basis rather than daily, a weekly pricing model is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
*   **Targeting Repeat Users:** The strategy capitalizes on users who might unsubscribe after solving an immediate problem but then re-subscribe later when another need arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.
*   **Pricing Tiers:** Suggested weekly pricing points are $4 or $7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. While $7 per week is steep (around $30/month), $4 is considered fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>.
*   **No Free Trial:** For apps like this, avoiding a free trial can maximize revenue from immediate user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

### AB Testing Pricing
Comprehensive A/B testing is crucial to optimize pricing and maximize proceeds per download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.
*   **Variations:** Test different weekly ($4, $7), monthly ($8, $10, $15, $20), and annual ($30, $40, $50, $70) pricing variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.
*   **Free Trial Inclusion:** Test whether including a free trial impacts user acquisition and retention for each pricing tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations
When developing a medical AI app, it is paramount to include clear disclaimers, ensuring users understand that the AI does not provide definitive diagnoses but rather guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. Accuracy of the AI is also critical; simply using a basic prompt for a GPT wrapper is insufficient. Developers should invest in complex prompting pipelines to ensure high accuracy and avoid providing misleading or harmful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

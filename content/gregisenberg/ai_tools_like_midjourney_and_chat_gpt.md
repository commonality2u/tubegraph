Brett from Designjoy, a one-man designer making millions of dollars annually, leverages AI to create "some of the most beautiful designs" ever seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These AI tools simplify the process of generating stunning graphics, making it accessible even to non-designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The core idea is that there's no hidden magic; the tools are powerful and easy to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Accessibility for Non-Designers
While a talented designer might find these tools powerful, the goal is for anyone, including non-designers, to "create insane value" from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Much of the content and tutorials related to these tools are not exclusively for designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. No prior design knowledge is required, though good taste can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The so-called "skill issue" for non-creatives is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Types of Generative AI
The current phase of generative AI includes various realms such as image generation and video generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Getting Started with AI Creation
To begin with AI creation, starting with simpler tools is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Higsfield: Easy Entry for Product Ads
Higsfield is presented as an easy entry point for those with no prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. It offers pre-set templates, actions, and effects, simplifying the process of generating visuals for products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This addresses the common challenge of knowing how to "talk to the AI" and what to tell it to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

For example, by picking a preset and uploading a product image (like a Liquid Death can), Higsfield can generate a video that takes into account the product's branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. It can even swap models and maintain text on the can, which historically has been a "problem child" for AI generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Higsfield is useful for creating cool [[using_chatgpt_4o_to_create_inexpensive_ads | ads]] for platforms like Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Midjourney and ChatGPT: The Core Duo
While tools like Higsfield are good for simple product ads, the "real fun" is found with [[effective_ad_prompting_techniques_with_chatgpt | ChatGPT]] and Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
Although many AI tools are constantly emerging (e.g., Cling, Korea, Visual Electric, Flora) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, Midjourney and ChatGPT are the most frequently used together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Midjourney for Artistic Styling
Midjourney excels at artistic styling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It's the go-to tool for creating something truly artistic, such as Kodak vintage aerial photos of a golf course or brand directions for surfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### ChatGPT for Specificity and Prompting
ChatGPT is used when a very specific outcome is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. For example, to insert a realistic person into a photo, ChatGPT can achieve a more realistic result than Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

#### Prompting with ChatGPT
The effectiveness of these AI systems hinges on the quality of the prompt or reference image provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. While prompting was once a specialized skill requiring "author level skills," ChatGPT has changed this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Prompting is no longer a gatekept skill; ChatGPT is very good at generating effective prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

**Example Prompting Process:**
1.  **Start with a simple idea:** Ask ChatGPT to generate image prompts. For instance, "I want to write some image prompts to generate a zoomed in photo of a cowboy in the back of a horse riding the rains or holding holding the rains. The photo should be zoomed in on the hands and rains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
2.  **ChatGPT provides options:** It returns several well-done prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
3.  **Refine iteratively:** Users can provide feedback (e.g., "now I want one zoomed in on a cowboy's hat") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. ChatGPT then adds rich, extra detail to the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
4.  **Generate collections:** ChatGPT can "dream up" entire collections of scenes that tie back to an initial prompt with different elements and environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Image Prompts vs. Style References
*   **Image Prompts:** Inserting a photo into Midjourney as an image prompt means the generated image will likely include elements from the reference photo (e.g., a person, a surfboard, greenery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Style References:** Uploading a style reference ensures that generated images will have the same colors, shadows, highlights, and depth of field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. It's also possible to mix styles by uploading multiple style references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Pinterest is a "phenomenal" resource for finding stylistic directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Adding Motion and Enhancements
Once images are generated, they can be further enhanced using other AI tools.

### Runway and Cling for Video Generation
*   **Runway:** Images can be uploaded to Runway to add motion and turn them into videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Similar to image generation, ChatGPT can be used to create detailed prompts for Runway, specifying movements like "soft ripples in the water," "smoke coming," or "trees blowing softly in the wind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Runway's quality is described as "upper echelon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Cling:** Another image-to-video tool, Cling, allows for setting a start and end frame, enabling seamless looping videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. It also features an "AI sound" button that generates sound options contextually related to the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Extending Video Length:** While these tools typically limit videos to about 10 seconds, continuous shots can be created by saving the last frame of one video, uploading it as the start of the next, and stitching them together with a simple video editing tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   **Upscaling:** Generated videos can be upscaled to 4K resolution with a simple click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

### Other Enhancement Tools
*   **Photoshop:** Can be used for generative fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Magnific Upscaler:** Helps to bring out "super rich details" in generated images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Cap Cut:** A user-friendly video platform for adding text layers on top of generated videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

## Opportunities for Startups and Branding
The AI tools offer significant opportunities, especially in branding for new ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

*   **Consistent Branding:** Midjourney allows for setting up a "mood board" by referencing a specific code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. This ensures continuity and consistency across all generated content, allowing for fast replication of assets for social media or other uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
*   **Leveraging AI for Assets:** The ability to take existing references and rapidly build new, consistent creatives is a major advantage for startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

### Limitations
While powerful, AI design tools still have limitations:
*   **Logo Design:** Not currently good at logo design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.
*   **Full Brand Generation:** Cannot generate an entire brand using only AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.
*   **Text Imperfection:** Text is not always perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   **Vector Art:** Does not do vector art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
*   **Finicky Outputs:** Midjourney and Runway can be "finicky," sometimes producing unexpected or strange results, requiring adjustments to prompts or re-generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

Despite these limitations, the potential for generating high-quality visual content is immense.
> "It's a creative person's dream, but it's definitely fun, even if you're a non-creative, to be able to just generate something as beautiful as this. like you could never have done anything remotely close to this. I'm a creative and I could have never done anything remotely close to this um for the rest of my career most likely, but now I can do it in 5 minutes." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>

## Getting Hands-On
Users are encouraged to "get their hands dirty" and utilize ChatGPT to help them communicate with AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. It's advised to pick a few preferred tools, stick with them, and learn their functionalities rather than getting overwhelmed by the sheer number of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.
> "You can do really remarkable things with very little effort, which I think is the is the coolest part about AI and something not a lot of people want to say or admit. You know, I think there's a there's a a level of gatekeep keeping this around this sort of stuff and and my goal is just to kind of break down those barriers and show pretty much anybody can do this sort of stuff." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>

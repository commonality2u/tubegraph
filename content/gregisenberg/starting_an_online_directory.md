From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Starting an online directory is presented as a low-risk way to launch a startup, with people reportedly making $5K, $10K, $15K, or even $20K a month from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Directories are becoming increasingly popular in what is described as a "Golden Era" for them, as people seek curated content due to the overwhelming amount of information online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Users trust directories for well-curated content, reviews, and ratings, often outsourcing their decision-making from general search engines like Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Finding and Validating an Idea
The best way to start when [[finding_and_validating_niche_ideas_for_directories | finding a directory idea]] is to base it on [[keyword_research_for_directories | keyword research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This helps determine if people are actually searching for specific keywords or phrases related to your idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Keyword Research Tools
*   **Google Keyword Planner**: This tool, commonly used for ad planning, can also show traffic for keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Spend hours exploring random ideas to see if there's traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Google Search Suggestions**: Typing "how do I" or similar phrases into Google and observing suggested searches can reveal what people are looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. These suggestions can be used to populate FAQ sections, as each title is a possible Google search query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### Domain Name Selection
It's crucial for the directory's domain name to match the target keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. While exact word matches were historically important, Google now prioritizes the *meaning* of words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This allows for flexibility in finding available domains (e.g., using "mini" instead of "small" for "small business ideas") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Always aim for affordable domains, typically under $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Building the Directory
The "worst way" to build a directory is by coding it from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Even for experienced developers, a no-code approach is 100% better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Why No-Code?
*   **Faster Launch**: No-code tools allow for quicker starts using templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Marketing & SEO Readiness**: Modern CMS or web builders have out-of-the-box features for marketing pages, A/B tests, blogs, and programmatic [[using_ai_and_seo_for_directory_growth | SEO]], which are difficult and time-consuming to implement manually with code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Delegation**: No-code platforms make it easier to delegate content creation and publishing to non-developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Essential Features at Launch
For the first launch, the only important element is the directory's items (listings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Features like ratings or user profiles will be empty and don't make sense for a new directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Start with a simple page displaying names and items, adding other features months or even a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### Using AI in Building
AI can be used to generate basic directory content like menus, structure, titles, and subtitles, saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. AI can also help create FAQ sections by generating answers to potential Google search queries, providing content for possible SEO ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. It's recommended to start with basic "fake items" for SEO testing before investing time in full pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

## Promoting and Growing the Directory
A directory should be built and promoted quickly, ideally within one evening, to allow for rapid testing and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. It's advisable to launch multiple directories (5-10 ideas) simultaneously to mitigate the risk of a single idea failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

### Strategies for Promotion
*   **Reddit**: Search Google for "\[your niche] Reddit" to find relevant discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Reply to articles where people explicitly ask for resources or ideas, being careful not to be banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. Pace your replies (e.g., 1-3 per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
*   **Other Directories**: List your directory on other relevant directories to gain traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **Social Media**: Search for relevant questions on platforms like Twitter and reply with your directory's link if it helps answer the original question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. Backlinks from social media, especially viral posts, can significantly boost Google traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

### SEO for Directories
[[using_seo_and_keyword_research_for_directory_success | SEO]] is the most important part of growing directories but should only be pursued *after* initial validation of the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. If initial promotion doesn't yield clicks, the idea or domain might be fundamentally flawed, and it's difficult to fix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

*   **Content Generation**: Use tools or AI (like ChatGPT) to generate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. For a fresh site with a low domain rating, limit new articles to a maximum of 50 in the first month to avoid looking like spam to Google, then increase in subsequent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. Start with around 10 articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **SEO is More Than Content**: It involves internal linking, site structure, and advanced keyword research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.

## Post-Launch: Validation and Data Quality
After about 30 days, evaluate the directories based on traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. Focus on the best-performing one and invest more time there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

### Data Quality
This is a critical stage where many directory builders fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>. Experts in a niche can quickly assess the quality and curation of your data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. High-quality, well-curated data leads to trust and organic sharing by influencers within the niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

### Staying Current
Continually monitor the niche (e.g., by scrolling Twitter) for new, hot items and quickly add them to your directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Being early to list these items can capture Google traffic from users searching for new trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## Monetizing Online Directories
There are multiple [[monetizing_online_directories | monetization strategies for online directories]]:

1.  **Banner/Sponsor Spots**: Effective for B2B directories where businesses want to reach the same audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. Offer featured listings at the top of the directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.
2.  **Affiliate Links**: Works well if the listed items are expensive (e.g., $500+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.
3.  **Selling Anonymized Data/Insights**: Sell trends or aggregated data to corporates interested in industry distributions and percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
4.  **Paywall for Listings**: Charge a fee for businesses or individuals to be listed (e.g., nannies paying to be listed on a nanny directory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>.
5.  **Charge for Access**: Implement a paywall for users to access the full database or sensitive contact information (e.g., showing only top 5 listings or blurred photos, requiring payment to unlock) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.
6.  **Brand Sponsorships**: Once a directory is large, secure ongoing sponsorships from big companies looking for brand promotion rather than direct traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>. These can be less intrusive than banners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.
7.  **Indirect Monetization (for SaaS)**: Use directories to win SEO traffic for non-competitive keywords, then channel that traffic to a related SaaS product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. This is often more effective than trying to win SEO directly for a SaaS tool with a random brand name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
8.  **Selling the Directory**: Sell the directory to businesses or SaaS companies that can benefit from its targeted audience and traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. This can be a highly effective marketing acquisition strategy for buyers, often cheaper than other traffic sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

### Directory Valuation
Directory sales don't have a standardized multiple based on revenue, as revenue might not be the primary driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. Valuations depend on audience quality and traffic.
*   Small directories: $2K - $5K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>
*   Average directories: $15K - $20K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>
*   Bigger directories: Up to $100K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>

### Where to Buy/Sell Directories
*   **Marketplaces**: Smaller marketplaces like MicroAcquire.io might list directories, as larger ones often require revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. A new marketplace, selldirectories.com, is being launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.
*   **Direct Outreach**: Use tools like Similarweb to research directory traffic and audience, then directly offer to buy them from founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. This can lead to better deals as founders might be surprised by the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.

## Potential Income and Risk
For a side project, individuals can typically expect to reach $5K MRR, potentially growing to $10K-$15K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. Reaching $20K MRR is achievable but might require full-time dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. Directories are considered a low-risk way to start an internet business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>. Unlike SaaS, where failure is common, directories are hard to fail if enough are launched and consistent effort is maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. Even with minimal ongoing effort, SEO can help directories maintain and grow traffic over time in non-competitive keyword spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.

[[Deploying Apps Using Vercel | Deploying applications]] has become significantly easier with platforms like Vercel, particularly for applications built using Next.js. This process allows developers to take their locally developed projects and make them accessible live on the internet. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a framework used for building websites, leveraging React. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a> It provides a structure that simplifies the development of web applications.

## What is Vercel?

Vercel is the company that created Next.js. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a> They are known for their programming tools and have developed a platform specifically designed to host Next.js applications online. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>

## Streamlined Deployment with Vercel

Vercel makes the deployment process for Next.js applications "super easy". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a> Once a Next.js app is developed (which can be done for free as it's an open-source framework), it can be hosted online through Vercel's platform. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>

### How to Deploy

Vercel provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that simplifies deployment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a> The main steps involve:

1.  **Logging In**: Connect your local environment to your Vercel account. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>
2.  **Running the Deployment Command**: Once logged in, deploying the app is as simple as typing `vercel` in the command line. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>
    *   This command initiates the deployment process. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>
3.  **Monitoring Deployment**: Vercel handles the building and deployment, typically taking about a minute and a half, though it can be faster. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>
4.  **Accessing the Live App**: After deployment, Vercel provides a URL where the application is live and accessible on any device. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>

This streamlined process allows developers to quickly make their applications, such as a voice-activated weather bot, available for others to try. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>

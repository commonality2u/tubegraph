Marketers will act as portfolio managers, adjusting strategies based on real-time market signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Why Vibe Marketing Now?
The emergence of [[Vibe Marketing and its impact on modern marketing strategies | Vibe Marketing]] is due to three converging factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>:
1.  **AI's Maturity**: [[ai_marketing_automation | AI]] has become sophisticated enough to handle complex marketing tasks, enabling agents to manage execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
2.  **Accessible Automation**: [[vibe_coding_and_replit_for_app_development | Vibe Coding]] tools have made automation accessible even to non-developers, requiring no coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

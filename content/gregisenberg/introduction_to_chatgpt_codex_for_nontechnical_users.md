[[using_codex_in_the_browser_for_beginner_developers | Codex]] is an AI engineer in the browser developed by Sam Altman and OpenAI, designed to assist with coding tasks. This article provides an introduction for nontechnical users, focusing on how to leverage [[using_codex_in_the_browser_for_beginner_developers | Codex]] to get the most out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## What is Codex?

[[using_codex_in_the_browser_for_beginner_developers | Codex]] is a tool that allows users to type in a task, which it then codes for them and pushes to [[nontechnical_guide_to_setting_up_and_using_github | GitHub]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It simplifies the coding process, making it accessible even for those without a technical background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Target Audience

While initially perceived as a tool for senior engineers, [[using_codex_in_the_browser_for_beginner_developers | Codex]] can be effectively used by nontechnical individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The user experience is designed to abstract away the complexity of code, allowing users to focus on defining tasks rather than writing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

## How Codex Works: A Practical Example

### Connecting to GitHub

To use [[using_codex_in_the_browser_for_beginner_developers | Codex]], you need to have [[nontechnical_guide_to_setting_up_and_using_github | GitHub]] connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. [[nontechnical_guide_to_setting_up_and_using_github | GitHub]] is a platform where code is stored in "repositories" (repos), which are essentially your project files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Any changes made are recorded as "commits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

To get started:
1.  Create a new repository on [[nontechnical_guide_to_setting_up_and_using_github | GitHub]] for your project (e.g., a personal site or marketing site) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
2.  Give it a name and choose if it's public or private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
3.  Add a README file, which explains what your project does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

> "I can't write a line of code myself bar like the minimum stuff but I can ship all sorts of stuff with tools like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>

### Making Changes with Codex

Here's an example of modifying a website using [[using_codex_in_the_browser_for_beginner_developers | Codex]]:

1.  **Define the Task**: Input a clear command, such as "add another tab next to investments tools that is called food. I like. Put tacos." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
2.  **Generate Code**: Click "Code" in [[using_codex_in_the_browser_for_beginner_developers | Codex]]. It will analyze existing files, create new ones if needed, and update the main site to incorporate the new feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
3.  **Review Changes**: [[using_codex_in_the_browser_for_beginner_developers | Codex]] shows what files it has changed and how many lines of code were added or removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   **Lines of Code Changed**: Positive numbers (+) indicate lines added, while negative numbers (-) indicate lines removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
4.  **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Once [[using_codex_in_the_browser_for_beginner_developers | Codex]] completes its task, create a new PR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
    *   A PR is a proposal to merge changes from a separate "branch" (a copy of your code where changes are made) back into the "main branch" of your project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
    *   This process ensures that new features are working correctly and don't conflict with the existing codebase before being integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
5.  **Merge the PR**: If there are no conflicts and all checks pass, you can merge the PR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Merging incorporates the changes into your live project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   **Merged**: The task's code has been successfully integrated into the main codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
    *   **Closed**: The task was completed but not merged, meaning the proposed changes were not adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. This acts as a "deny" feature for changes you don't want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
6.  **Verify on Live Site**: After merging, the changes will deploy and become visible on your website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

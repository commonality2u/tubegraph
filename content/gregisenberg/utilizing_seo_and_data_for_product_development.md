This article explores how to leverage data, trends, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to develop successful products, drawing insights from Ashwin, an expert in consumer brands and physical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While the focus is often on consumer packaged goods (CPG), many of these principles can be applied to software startups as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Evaluating Opportunities with Ahrefs

[[AI and SEO integration for business growth | Ahrefs]] is a powerful tool primarily used in the SEO world, but it offers invaluable insights for product development by helping to evaluate category demand and trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Understanding Search Volume and Keyword Difficulty
Ahrefs allows users to input any keyword and provides two key metrics:
*   **Search Volume**: A general sense of the monthly search volume on Google for that keyword, term, or brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Keyword Difficulty (KD)**: A ranking from 0 to 100 indicating how difficult it is to rank for that term on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

For example, the term "electrolytes" shows good search volume with seasonal trends, peaking in June and July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. However, its keyword difficulty is 88, indicating high competition and making it a near-impossible endeavor to rank organically in the top Google slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This immediately signals a crowded market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Identifying Global Opportunities
Analyzing global search volume distribution can reveal untapped markets. For instance, if 74% of "electrolytes" searches come from the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, it suggests potential for new brands in non-English speaking countries like Germany, India, or the Philippines, where the trend might still be nascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This approach leverages proven business models in new geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### "Gut Checking" Product Ideas
Before developing a product, it's crucial to "gut check" its demand using Ahrefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Many entrepreneurs start with an idea, build it, and only then realize there isn't sufficient demand or the market is too crowded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Ahrefs helps to:
*   Understand the search volume for a specific category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   Assess the potential to organically capture demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   Identify existing competitors in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

The key is to ask "why" behind the data, rather than just observing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. For example, the explosive growth of CBD in 2019 was due to the 2018 Farm Bill, while its subsequent decline coincided with the rise of Delta 9, a legal THC alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Understanding such market shifts provides deeper insight.

## Market Analysis with Particle
Particle is a tool that allows users to analyze e-commerce brands, providing non-public sales data over time, product categories, and best-selling products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

It's useful for:
*   **Benchmarking Competitors**: Understanding sales figures of competitors in a given space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **De-risking Product Decisions**: Identifying top-selling SKUs and flavors. If 90% of a company's revenue comes from a few core products or flavors (e.g., chocolate and vanilla in supplements), it suggests focusing on those proven successes rather than inventing new, potentially unpopular variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Trend Exploration**: Particle also features a Trend Explorer to observe how product categories are trending up or down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

Similar sales insights can also be gleaned from platforms like TikTok Shop and Amazon, which often display sales figures like "100K bought in the last month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

## Building a Physical Product Business

While building a physical product business is challenging due to complexities like supply chain, finance, and inventory forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>, it offers unique advantages.

### The Case for Physical Products
Building a physical product business, especially in a low-stakes or low-risk manner, is an excellent way to become proficient in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. The consumer product world is at the "bleeding edge" of marketing because it's exceptionally difficult to capture consumer attention and persuade them to part with their money for a physical good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. This contrasts with B2B software, where convincing a company to purchase a solution that saves time is often easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

## Marketing and Differentiation
In crowded markets, differentiation is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. For a popular product like magnesium glycinate, simply creating a supplement isn't enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

### Standing Out
Differentiation can be achieved through:
*   **Look and Feel / Branding**: Many products in a category might look generic or "medical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Brands like Moon Juice differentiate with visually striking packaging (e.g., amber jars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. Similarly, Lemi (Courtney Kardashian's brand) uses custom bottling, unique caps, and vibrant colors to create a fun, accessible brand positioning, contrasting with unbranded, clinical-looking alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.
*   **Targeted Audience / Positioning**: Brands like Seed differentiate by how they communicate with consumers and the specific audience they target, even if the product is for a broader demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

### Untapped Markets
Current product design trends often fall into "Millennial Blanding" (minimalist, similar aesthetics) or "Gen Z" (bright, vibrant, saturated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. This creates an opportunity to [[Targeting niche markets with SEO strategies | target niche markets]] that are underserved by these aesthetics. For example, creating highly branded, well-designed products for older adults who also want beautiful products, not just functional ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. This demographic often has more disposable income and consumes information from less saturated channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

## Bootstrap Development and AI Tools

Starting a physical product business doesn't necessarily require a massive upfront investment in agencies.

### Resourceful Approaches
*   **Category-Specific Design Needs**: Some categories, like spirits, demand intentional, high-quality design for success, making bootstrapping design harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. However, for problem-solution oriented products (e.g., pimple patches like Mighty Patch or Starface), design can be simpler and more budget-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.
*   **Freelance Talent**: Platforms like Fiverr and Upwork allow founders to hire independent freelance designers for simple packaging design or landing page setup at a fraction of agency costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
*   **Testing Demand**: After minimal investment in basic design, founders can run online ads (e.g., Facebook Ads) to [[Creating and testing product demand through online ads | gauge demand]] and drive leads before significant financial commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.

### [[Leveraging AI in product and marketing development | Leveraging AI in Product and Marketing Development]]
AI tools like Manis or Midjourney can serve as an "unfair advantage" in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.
*   **Initial Design & Research**: AI can generate V1 design concepts and packaging mockups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. For instance, Midjourney can create initial designs, which can then be refined by a freelance designer for a minimal fee ($250) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
*   **Market Research**: Manis can perform deep research on competitors, analyze product details, and research specific customer needs (e.g., skincare for older adults) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. This can produce comprehensive reports that would otherwise cost tens of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.

## Relentless Research and Point of View
Whether building software or consumer products, being a "relentless researcher" of the category and competition is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.

This involves:
*   **Extensive Reading**: Consuming all available information about the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.
*   **Competitor Analysis**: Systematically examining existing brands, their aesthetics, website design, and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>. This includes understanding their one-sentence takeaway, communicated message, and target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   **Direct Customer Engagement**: Visiting stores and talking to owners about what's selling or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. For software, this means looking at existing software reviews (especially one and two-star complaints) and talking to potential users (e.g., dentists for CRM software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

This research process develops a robust point of view, preventing reliance on mere hunches when deciding what to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.

## Conclusion
The fundamental principle for any venture, whether software or physical products, is to work backward from distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Identify the channels to acquire customers and where you can win, then build the product to fit those channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. This aligns with the adage: "First-time founders focus on product, second-time founders focus on distribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>. Often, products that are considered "subpar" can succeed tremendously due to outstanding distribution and operational excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.

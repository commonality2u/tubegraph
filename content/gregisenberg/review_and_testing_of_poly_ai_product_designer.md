From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Poly is an AI product designer startup from Y Combinator that claims to help non-designers create beautiful designs and production-ready front-end code by simply writing English prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The product aims to translate natural language into visual interfaces and functional code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This article details a first-time live test of Poly and a comparison with [[comparison_of_ai_product_designers_poly_and_vz | VZ]].

## Initial Impressions and Features

The interface of Poly resembles [[creative_workflows_and_tools_in_ai_design | ChatGPT]] but is tailored for design, allowing users to write their design specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Notable features include:
*   **Voice Input**: A microphone option for dictating design ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Image Upload**: The ability to upload an image, such as a hand-drawn wireframe, for Poly to reference and build upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Design Customization**: Options to adjust elements like font, radius, and colors post-generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Credit System**: The platform operates on a credit system, where free accounts receive 250 credits, with pages costing 50 credits and components 25 credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Design History**: Generated designs are saved and accessible on the right-hand side of the interface, with a rollback button for previous versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

## Testing Process: Developing a YouTube Analytics SAS

To test Poly, a startup idea for a YouTube analytics and prediction SaaS product was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This idea, inspired by a viral tweet about an algorithm predicting tweet performance, aims to help YouTubers predict how changes to titles, thumbnails, and other elements will affect engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The desired aesthetic for the design was "glassy, minimalist, and with colorful calls to action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

### First Prompt Attempt
The initial prompt given to Poly was: "I have an idea for a startup. It's basically this concept which is an algo that tells you if or how well a tweet will do. I want to do this with YouTube. So many YouTubers want to know if they change their title, change their thumbnail, how will it affect engagement? I want you to create a SaaS that does this. Make it glassy, minimalist, and with colorful calls to action." An image of the inspiration (the tweet analytics tool) was also attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

The first generation took several minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The output was a landing page named "to predict," with the tagline "AI powered analytics to optimize your YouTube content and maximize your engagement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. However, the design was not perceived as "glassy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, and clickable elements like "Get Started" and "See Demo" did not lead to product views, only a black screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The generated product images on the landing page were irrelevant, looking like generic website analytics dashboards rather than YouTube-specific predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

### Second Prompt Attempt
Realizing the importance of specific terminology in [[creative_workflows_and_tools_in_ai_design | AI design]], the user researched the term for "glassy" design, discovering it was "glassmorphism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. The second prompt requested Poly to apply "glassmorphism" and to create actual product images on the landing page, as well as a clickable demo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The user also expressed disappointment about the irrelevant product images and re-attached the inspiration image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Unlike [[comparison_of_ai_product_designers_poly_and_vz | VZ]], Poly did not ask clarifying questions, acting as a "dark hole" for prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

The second generation showed some improvement in glass-like elements, but was still not fully glassmorphic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. However, clicking "Get Started" now led to a functional product view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

## Results and Evaluation of Poly

### Product Design
After the second prompt, Poly generated a more functional product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>, though it still made some assumptions, such as including an "image/video format" option instead of solely focusing on YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Key elements included:
*   **AB Testing Interface**: Features like "Version A," "original content," "title," "description," and "thumbnail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
*   **Prediction Metrics**: Predicted performance with [[using_ai_for_app_design_and_functionality | AI recommendations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **Engagement Charts**: A "cumulative engagement chart" and "statistical confidence" metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   **Optimization Features**: "Recent optimizations" and "AI suggestions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

While the product view was considered "beautiful" and "really helpful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>, the overall aesthetic was still not as "glassy" as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. A notable positive for Poly was the ability to hover over chart points to see specific numbers, a feature missing in the [[comparison_of_ai_product_designers_poly_and_vz | VZ]] output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. Poly also generates the underlying code for the designs, which is seen as a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

| **Code Output**     | Generates production-ready code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This was a pro for Poly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.                                                              | Also generates front-end code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.                                                                                                        |
| **Ease of Use**     | Required more specific design terms and iterative prompting to achieve desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.              | More intuitive due to conversational feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.                                                                                                        |

While Poly eventually produced a functional and in-depth product design, it required more iterative prompting and lacked the conversational feedback loop present in [[comparison_of_ai_product_designers_poly_and_vz | VZ]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. Overall, [[comparison_of_ai_product_designers_poly_and_vz | VZ]] was perceived as slightly better for its user experience and visual design, but Poly's ability to generate production-ready code was a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.

## Conclusion and Recommendations for AI Design Tools

The review highlights that for [[developing user interfaces with AI tools | AI product design]], users often need to know specific design terms to effectively prompt the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

The traditional marketing funnel is an outdated and deceptive way to understand modern marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. People do not buy products or services in a linear fashion where they enter at the top and simply come out the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Instead, individuals interact with a brand, move away, get drawn back in, orbit it multiple times, and then "touch down" with a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## The Digital Gravity Model
"Digital Gravity" is a proposed new framework for understanding how to build brands and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It posits that a company builds "digital mass" on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The more digital mass a company acquires, the greater its influence within its niche or sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

This mass is built through:
*   Content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   [[Branding and marketing strategies for products | Marketing]] everywhere the target customer is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

As a company (or "planet") builds more mass, more "comets" (customers) are drawn into its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. These orbiting customers eventually "touch down," which converts into revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This process creates a "growth flywheel," where generated revenue is reinvested back into the company's growth, leading to further mass accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Marketing as a Continuous Process
Modern marketing should not be viewed as a series of "campaigns" (a term originating from military operations implying a start and end) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Instead, marketing is a continuous, ongoing activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This requires a mindset shift:
*   Continuously running and testing ads to find the most impactful and cost-effective ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   Considering websites and apps as living, breathing entities that are never truly "done" after publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   The only exception to this malleability in the digital realm is email, which once sent, cannot be recalled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### The Volume and Surface Area Game
The modern marketing landscape is a "volume game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Increasing the quantity of content and marketing efforts increases the "surface area" for potential customer interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. For example, top-performing affiliates create ten times more videos than lower performers, playing a surface area game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

Traditional notions, such as maintaining only one Instagram account or publishing a single blog post a week, are considered outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## [[B2B and Consumer Marketing Tactics | Tactical B2B Marketing Strategies]]
For [[B2B and Consumer Marketing Tactics | B2B]] companies, the target audience is typically smaller (e.g., 50,000 people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. The goal is to make the company famous within its specific category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

1.  **Email Scraping & Ad Targeting:**
    *   Scrape target audience emails using tools like Apollo.io <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   Import these emails into Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads for custom audience matching (expect 30-40% match on platforms like Facebook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
    *   Run continuous ads to these custom lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

2.  **[[AIdriven marketing strategies | AI-driven Ad Creation and Testing]]:**
    *   Utilize [[tips_for_effective_aidriven_marketing_strategies | AI Avatar]] ads, specifically UGC (User-Generated Content) style ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
    *   Tools: HeyGen for AI avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a> and ElevenLabs for voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
    *   Create 100 variations of ads with different hooks, settings, backgrounds, and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
    *   Test all variations to find the lowest CPC (cost per click) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
    *   Allocate 80% of the ad budget to the best-performing ads and 20% to continuous testing (Alpha Beta campaign structure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
    *   Founders are encouraged to create digital clones of themselves to feature in these ads, leveraging personal [[Branding and marketing strategies for products | branding]] for influence and easier future fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. People buy from people, not just brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

3.  **Cold Email Outreach:**
    *   Simultaneously cold email every individual from the scraped list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
    *   Tools: MailReef (for dedicated cold email servers on AWS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, Smartlead or Instantly AI (cold email sending software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
    *   Separate domains for transactional, newsletter, and cold emails to prevent domain flagging from affecting product functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
    *   Emails should follow a problem-solution orientation, mirroring the ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
    *   The goal is to land as many emails in inboxes as possible to create more "surface area" for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
    *   Refute the notion that cold email doesn't work; it's about addressing specific problems with tailored messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

4.  **Building a Media Company (Podcast & Content Repurposing):**
    *   Interview customers about their pain points and problems, recording these conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
    *   Turn these recordings into a podcast, which is then sent out to the entire email list (e.g., 200 emails/day with a clear subject line and summary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
    *   Tools for email newsletters: MailerLite, Beehive, SendGrid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
    *   This provides educational, valuable, and less transactional content, building a media company that offers industry-specific insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.
    *   Owned media (like a popular podcast) creates leverage for negotiations, e.g., with large lab companies, or selling ad placements to subsidize growth team costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
    *   Repurpose podcast content:
        *   Transcribe episodes into blog posts and white papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.
        *   Use [[AIdriven marketing strategies | AI tools]] like Swell AI to create clips, show notes, and media assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.
        *   Schedule these clips as shorts across platforms like LinkedIn and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
        *   Run Instagram-only ads with a call to action to follow the account for more content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. The goal is to gain free impressions as the account grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.
        *   The closer an ad feels like content, the less it costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.

*   **Long-Term Impact:** After 12 months, this integrated approach results in massive ad remarketing, top-of-funnel leads, a large email list receiving weekly content, media leverage for deals, and daily social channel presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** An 18-month example shows 80,000 website clicks per month from an email newsletter for $450, compared to $5 per click on traditional ads (equating to $400,000 saved) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Mental Real Estate:** Consistently providing valuable content builds trust and occupies "mental real estate" in the customer's mind, making the company the go-to solution for their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.

> "If I have somebody sit down with me for an hour week and they listen to me talk for an hour week for two months like they just spent eight hours with me asynchronously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>

### Examples of Companies as Media Businesses
*   **Arrow Electronics:** A $6 billion market cap company that owns numerous electronics blogs and magazines, functioning as a media arm for its electronics component resale business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
*   **Red Bull:** Primarily a media company that sells a beverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
*   **Y Combinator:** A media company that sells venture capital, doubling down on YouTube content to engage founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

## [[B2B and Consumer Marketing Tactics | Tactical Consumer Marketing Strategies]]
[[B2B and Consumer Marketing Tactics | Consumer marketing]] is significantly more competitive and requires exceptional marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

1.  **Huge Total Addressable Market (TAM):** Essential for consumer products to create broad enough content to target a large subset of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.
2.  **Application First:** Focus on building a desirable application for a large audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
3.  **Pricing Strategy:** A price point of $7.99/month or $7.99/week (translating to ~$29/month) can lead to impulse purchases, generating three months of revenue for a quick return on customer acquisition cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.
4.  **Ad Platforms & Conversion Events:**
    *   Primary platforms: Facebook Ads and TikTok Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
    *   Optimize for conversion events like app sign-ups or paid actions within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.
5.  **[[Marketing through influencer partnerships | Influencer]] & UGC Creator Strategy:**
    *   Hire 5-10 UGC creators who can post a video daily for about $1,000/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>.
    *   These creators serve as a test bed for content that goes viral on their platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>.
    *   Content structure: Hook -> Pain Point -> Product as Hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.
    *   The goal is to create ads that feel like entertaining and educational content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.
6.  **Multi-Account Strategy (Short-Form Social):**
    *   Spin up 10 different TikTok accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
    *   Remix best-performing UGC content using [[AIdriven marketing strategies | AI tools]] (ChatGPT for scripts, HeyGen for videos, ElevenLabs for audio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.
    *   Use CapCut for green screen removal to place the app background behind AI avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.
    *   This creates top-of-funnel product touches, leading users to Google the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>.
7.  **Website Pixel & Remarketing:**
    *   Choose a unique product name to avoid competition on Google search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
    *   Install Facebook, TikTok, and Google pixels on the website to enable indefinite remarketing to visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.
    *   Offer email sign-up on the website for an email nurture sequence that upsells the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.
8.  **Scalable [[Marketing through influencer partnerships | Influencer Outreach]] & Affiliate Play:**
    *   Scrape emails of relevant YouTube channels/creators within the niche (emails are often in their bios) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.
    *   Conduct cold email outreach to inquire about their pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.
    *   Analyze average views versus cost to find "arbitrage" opportunities in the imperfect influencer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.
    *   Structure deals: purchase a three-video package (e.g., $1,500) combined with a 30% affiliate commission on recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.
    *   This creates stickiness, as creators earn substantial monthly income, deterring competitors from easily poaching them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
    *   This strategy can be replicated for Instagram (using tools like IGleads.io to scrape emails from specific hashtags or keywords) and TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.
    *   Goal: Maximize eyeballs on the product for the lowest possible cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
9.  **Programmatic SEO:**
    *   As the app gains domain authority (trust from Google due to backlinks), implement programmatic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
    *   Target thousands of long-tail, low-difficulty keywords related to the product (e.g., diet plans, nutrition plans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>.
    *   Process:
        *   Scrape top-ranking content for target keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.
        *   Use [[AIdriven marketing strategies | AI tools]] (like ChatGPT) to create blog post outlines based on this content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
        *   Write content section by section for quality and readability, ensuring it passes AI humanizer checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.
        *   Publish large volumes (e.g., 10,000 articles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.
        *   Once a page receives traffic (e.g., one session), a human SEO specialist edits and optimizes it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. This balances what Google wants to rank with what humans want to read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.
        *   On the content page, include clear calls to action (CTAs) for app sign-up: after the first paragraph, at least one visible CTA per screen frame, and a full-screen pop-up at 25-50% scroll rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>.
        *   Users who land on these pages are pixeled and added to the remarketing funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

> "The only thing that isn't like this is really email and digital... it is like the only thing that once you hit send you can't take back everything else pretty malleable you can always adjust it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>

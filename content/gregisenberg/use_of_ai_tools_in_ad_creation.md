The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools has significantly transformed the landscape of ad creation, making it possible for businesses to generate, test, and optimize advertising content at an unprecedented scale and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>. This shift allows for the creation of hundreds, if not thousands, of ads, a feat that was previously prohibitively costly without AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.

## Benefits of AI in Ad Creation

AI enables a strategy seen in gaming studios, where ads are created entirely from a computer without the need for actors or elaborate productions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>. This drastically reduces the cost and time associated with ad production. The primary advantage is the ability to rapidly test numerous ad variations to discover which formats resonate best with the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.

With AI, companies can:
*   **Scale Ad Production:** Create thousands of ads monthly to find profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.
*   **Reduce Costs:** Eliminate the need for actors and complex setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
*   **Accelerate Testing:** Test 20 different ad angles in a single day, identifying winning strategies faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.
*   **Localize Content:** Easily translate and adapt successful ads for different countries and languages, expanding market reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

## How AI Aids Ad Creation

The process of [[Using AI for copy and ad creative generation]] for ads involves several steps, often facilitated by specialized AI tools:

1.  **Scripting:** Users write a script for the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.
2.  **Actor Selection:** Choose from a library of AI-generated or AI-rendered actors with diverse demographics (age, situation, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. For example, for a calorie-tracking app, one might select actors in a gym setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>.
3.  **Voice Generation:** Utilize text-to-speech tools to generate the voiceover for the script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
4.  **Video Generation:** AI tools combine the script, chosen actor, and voiceover to produce a video ad in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.
5.  **Editing and Customization:** Basic editing tools can be used to add screenshots of the app, remove backgrounds behind actors, and piece together the final ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

AI enables the rapid iteration of different angles and variations of an ad until a winning formula is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. Furthermore, AI tools can facilitate the localization of ads, allowing companies to translate successful US ads into various languages like Spanish or French to target different global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

### Tools Mentioned

*   **[[Using AI for copy and ad creative generation | Arad]]**: A tool specifically designed for scaling the creation of ads using AI, by generating video ads from scripts and virtual actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.
*   **11 Labs**: A text-to-speech tool that can be used to generate ad voiceovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.

## Impact on Marketing Strategies

The ability to generate and test a high volume of ads with AI profoundly impacts marketing strategies. Companies can employ paid ad strategies on platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and Google by creating numerous high-quality ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This allows for a more data-driven approach to advertising, continuously optimizing performance by identifying the most effective creative elements.

The shift to AI-driven ad creation means that even small teams can execute sophisticated marketing campaigns previously only accessible to large gaming studios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.

## Examples of Companies Leveraging AI in Ads

*   **Ceyway**: A Turkish company making significant monthly revenue (e.g., $7 million from one plant identifier app) that utilizes AI to create a vast number of ads. They are known for testing over 30,000 video creatives to optimize their advertising efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>. They focus on identifying keywords people search for and add an "AI sizzle" to capture demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Their strategy involves iterating on different angles and localizing ads for various languages and locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.

Apps can achieve millions of downloads by mastering platforms like TikTok, which is considered an underpriced distribution channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Joseph Choy, an expert in consumer app growth, suggests that leveraging existing subcultures and "cult movements" is a significant opportunity for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## What are "Cult Movements" in this Context?
These refer to deep internet movements or established subcultures that possess strong ideologies or shared desires, but which may not yet have a product or app built specifically to serve their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>. Capitalizing on these existing communities can lead to highly engaged users and substantial revenue.

## Case Study: UMAX and Looksmaxing
One prominent example is the "looksmaxing" movement, which focuses on men improving their physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. This movement has deep roots in niche online communities and is driven by insecurities related to physical appearance and dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

Blake Anderson's app, UMAX, capitalized on this by providing a service that scans a user's face to assess their "potential" and offer tips on improving features like jawline, skin, or hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. The app generates millions in annual revenue, primarily through TikTok distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. UMAX was one of the first apps to specifically cater to this existing movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.

## A Framework for Finding Opportunities
To identify new app ideas within these "cult movements," consider what people generally want in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>:
*   **Health:** Apps related to physical well-being, fitness, or self-improvement. Looksmaxing, for instance, touches on this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.
*   **Wealth:** Apps that help people make money, manage finances, or build businesses.
*   **Relationships:** Apps focused on dating, social connections, or improving interpersonal dynamics. Looksmaxing also ties into finding love and dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

The goal is to find movements or desires that don't yet have a dedicated product to serve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.

## Case Study: Crayo and the "Cult of Money"
Crayo is an app that has achieved over five million in annual revenue by partnering with YouTubers and TikTokers who teach teenagers how to make money from platforms like TikTok and YouTube shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>.

Initially, these [[the_role_of_usergenerated_content_and_influencers_in_app_promotion | creators]] sold expensive courses on how to clip and mass-post streamer videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. Arab Khan, the founder of Crayo, then "productized" this course into software that automates the video creation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. This strategy leverages the existing "cult of money" among young people by providing a tool that directly addresses their desire for wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.

## Strategies for Integrating Apps with Subcultures
*   **Utilize TikTok Shop data:** Analyze the TikTok Shop Affiliate Center to find high-volume product categories and the [[the_role_of_usergenerated_content_and_influencers_in_app_promotion | creators]] selling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. These [[the_role_of_usergenerated_content_and_influencers_in_app_promotion | creators]] are already skilled at making [[using_organic_growth_for_mobile_apps | organic views]] content that converts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
*   **Develop apps that support existing product sales:** Create a [[consumer_mobile_app_development_strategies | consumer app]] that helps TikTok Shop [[the_role_of_usergenerated_content_and_influencers_in_app_promotion | creators]] sell their e-commerce products more effectively, potentially integrating [[embedding_ai_for_app_virality_and_user_engagement | AI]] vision for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. For example, a skincare analysis app could be used by [[the_role_of_usergenerated_content_and_influencers_in_app_promotion | creators]] to show before-and-after transformations when promoting products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
*   **Focus on high lifetime value (LTV) niches:** Consider niches with demographics willing to pay more for solutions, such as golfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. An [[embedding_ai_for_app_virality_and_user_engagement | AI]] golf swing analysis app could offer a more accessible alternative to expensive in-person coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.
*   **Integrate app interfaces subtly:** Flash the app's interface for a few seconds in videos where relevant to the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. This can generate curiosity in comments, leading to [[organic_growth_and_marketing_for_apps | downloads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
*   **Leverage TikTok's "For You Page" algorithm:** Unlike older [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_apps | influencer marketing]] models focused on follower counts, TikTok prioritizes good content that resonates with specific audiences, regardless of the [[the_role_of_usergenerated_content_and_influencers_in_app_promotion | creator's]] following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. This allows for hiring [[the_role_of_usergenerated_content_and_influencers_in_app_promotion | creators]] purely as "actors" to produce content on new brand accounts, making it a cheaper and scalable strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.
*   **Create dedicated accounts for successful content formats:** If a specific content format or character performs well, create a new TikTok account dedicated to that style to help the algorithm serve the content to the right audience consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.

## Product Quality is Paramount
While these [[strategies_for_organic_growth_of_consumer_apps_using_tiktok | strategies for organic growth of consumer apps using TikTok]] offer immense distribution potential, it's crucial that the product itself is high-quality and retains users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. Without strong retention, a [[consumer_mobile_app_development_strategies | consumer app]] becomes akin to an e-commerce product sold once, losing the benefits of scalability and recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>. Knowing your product's Lifetime Value (LTV) and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is essential before scaling marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.

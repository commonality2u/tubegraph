Justin Mayers, founder of Kettle & Fire, a nine-figure annual business, shares a framework for [[techniques_for_brainstorming_and_validating_startup_ideas | validating startup ideas]] with minimal initial investment and without building the product first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This approach aims to ensure you're working on the "right" [[startup_ideas_with_low_initial_investment | startup idea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Kettle & Fire: A Case Study in Validation

In 2014, while at Rackspace, Mayers sought to start his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. He had heard about bone broth's benefits from friends in CrossFit and from reading about its positive effects on skin, gut, and joint health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. At the time, bone broth was not widely discussed and difficult to find online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. His primary questions were: how many people want this product, and are there enough interested individuals willing to spend enough to support a meaningful business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>?

### Step 1: Assessing Market Interest (Macro & Micro)

Mayers investigated where his target audience (paleo and CrossFit communities) congregated online, including Mark's Daily Apple, Paleo Hacks, and [[using_reddit_to_find_startup_ideas | Reddit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. He observed the traffic and engagement levels in threads discussing bone broth's health benefits, recipes, and sourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This revealed a small but dedicated group of interested people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

On a macro level, he used Google Trends to see that bone broth was beginning to trend upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This combination confirmed that several thousand people were interested in the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Mayers emphasizes that he was solving his own problem first, as he personally wanted bone broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Google Trends was used to validate that the idea could support a decent business, not just a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. If Google Trends had shown no interest, combined with a failed next step, he would not have started the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Step 2: Testing Willingness to Pay (The "Fake Product" Test)

The crucial step was to determine if people would pay enough to make it a meaningful business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

1.  **Minimal Digital Presence:**
    *   He purchased the cheapest domain name with "bone broth" in it for $9.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
    *   He paid $5 on Fiverr for a "god-awful logo" and some renders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   He built a landing page using Unbounce, highlighting key value propositions identified from paleo forums: healing leaky gut, convenience (due to 24-48 hour cooking time), and organic/grass-fed ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

2.  **Pricing and "Fake" Checkout:**
    *   He set a price of $29.99 for 16 ounces, significantly higher than typical grocery store broth ($5 for 16 ounces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. He reasoned that if people were willing to pay six times more, the economics would likely work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
    *   The "Order Bone Broth Now" button on the landing page redirected users to Mayers' personal PayPal account for payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

3.  **Low-Budget Advertising:**
    *   He spent about $50 to $100 on Bing Ads (because it was cheaper than AdWords) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   Despite a "super sketchy checkout flow" and no actual product, people converted, demonstrating demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
    *   The test achieved a 30% conversion rate for clicking the order button and generated nearly $500 in revenue over two weeks, with approximately $250 spent on ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
    *   This validation confirmed that people would pay for the product and suggested a potential for $100,000+ in annual sales, even with a janky setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

> "The best part of the story is you use Bing. Yeah. Like how ghetto and sketchy Bing is. I was so broke. It's perfect. Yeah. No, but I think there's a lesson in there, right? The lesson is, you know, you were just trying to validate your thesis ultimately, right? So, it didn't make a difference if it was Google or Bing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>

### Step 3: Engaging with Early "Customers"

After validation, Mayers emailed everyone who placed an order, explaining the product wasn't in stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. He offered a full refund or a 50% discount and shipment in a few weeks (which ended up being eight months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Most customers accepted the discount, indicating strong demand and patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This process validated the idea before spending significant time and resources on product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## Modern Tools for Validating Startup Ideas (2025 Perspective)

Today, the process of [[finding_and_validating_software_business_ideas | finding and validating software business ideas]] or CPG products is even faster and more efficient due to advancements in AI and other tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>:

*   **Improved Landing Pages and Design:** AI can generate much better landing pages, logos, and product renders than was possible with basic tools and Fiverr in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Market Research:** AI tools can quickly scrape and perform sentiment analysis across platforms like [[using_reddit_to_find_startup_ideas | Reddit]], forums, and Twitter to gauge public discussion and interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
*   **Specific Tools:** Mayers highlights tools like Bolt.new (for building landing pages quickly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a> and Rok, as well as frontier AI models like Claude, GPT, and Gemini for becoming a "top 1% user" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** For $20 a month (e.g., for ChatGPT Pro), entrepreneurs can test dozens of [[startup_ideas_with_low_initial_investment | startups]] monthly to find the right one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.
*   **Reduced Barriers:** AI significantly lowers barriers to building CPG brands by assisting with design, branding, and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. A single individual can now build products that previously required large teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

## General Advice on Finding and Validating Ideas

*   **Start with a personal problem/passion:** The most successful businesses often stem from solving one's own problems or addressing areas of genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Being on the "frontier" of a topic, where you spend a lot of time, naturally leads to new and interesting [[brainstorming_startup_ideas | startup ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Identify Big Problems:** Focus on significant global problems that have relatively few people addressing them, or where energy is shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. An example is the chronic disease crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. If you can solve an important problem for people, a successful business will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.
*   **Validate Demand Early:** Before building anything substantial, try to get even 10 people to pay for the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This provides massive validation and helps quickly determine if there's enough interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   **Utilize Data:** All the necessary data to understand pain points and market sentiment is available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. The key is to distill it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Even if the first product doesn't achieve "escape velocity," continuous iteration and circling around a problem you care about can eventually lead to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

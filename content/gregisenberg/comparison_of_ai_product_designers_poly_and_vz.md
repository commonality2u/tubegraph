This article explores a comparison between two AI product design tools: Poly AI and VZ by Vercel. The comparison was conducted live on camera, testing their ability to generate designs and code from English prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The objective was to determine if [[ai_startups_and_product_design | AI product designers]] are ready for everyday workflow integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Poly AI: First Impressions and Review
Poly AI is an [[ai_startups_and_product_design | AI product designer YC startup]] that claims to generate beautiful designs and production-ready code from written English prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The tool aims to help non-designers create production-ready designs and front-end code with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The user noted that the output designs from Poly AI often look "really really beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Upon signing up, Poly AI auto-creates a first project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The interface resembles a chat-like experience, similar to Chat GPT, allowing users to type or use a microphone to describe what they want to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. A significant feature is the ability to upload an image, enabling users to draw a wireframe on a napkin and upload it for Poly AI to interpret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Poly AI operates on a credit system: 250 credits for free sign-up, with 50 credits per page and 25 credits per component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The tool allows for light or dark mode and has settings for font, radius, and colors to edit the generated design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## The Startup Idea: YouTube Content Prediction SaaS
For the [[review_and_testing_of_poly_ai_product_designer | Poly AI review and testing]], a multi-million dollar startup idea was used: a SaaS product for YouTubers to predict content performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The idea is inspired by an algorithm that simulates user reactions to tweets to predict virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The goal was to create a tool where YouTubers could input a title and thumbnail to see predicted comments, likes, and subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The prompt given to Poly AI was:
> "I have an idea for a startup. It's basically this concept which is an algo that tells you if or how well a tweet will do. I want to do this with YouTube, so many YouTubers want to know if they change their title, change their thumbnail, how will it affect engagement? I want you to create a SaaS that does this. Make it glassy, minimalist, and with colorful calls to action." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>

### Poly AI's First Attempt
The initial generation process with Poly AI took "a few minutes," and it lacked a progress bar, making the waiting process less transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

The first output from Poly AI was a landing page named "C2 predict" with the tagline "AI powered analytics to optimize your YouTube content and maximize your engagement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. While the copy was decent, the design itself did not appear "super glassy" as requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Critically, clicking "Get Started" or "C demo" resulted in a "black screen of death," meaning the tool only generated a landing page and not the actual product interface or a clickable demo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

### Poly AI's Second Attempt and Learning Curve
The user then directly critiqued Poly AI for not creating the actual product interface and for irrelevant product images, asking it to incorporate "glassmorphism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This highlighted a key lesson: to get the most out of [[leveraging_ai_tools_for_product_design_and_market_analysis | AI product design tools]], users need to know specific design terms and current trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

After the second prompt, Poly AI delivered a more functional product interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. It included elements like "version A," "image video format," "cumulative engagement chart," "statistical confidence," "recent optimizations," and "AI suggestions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. While still not fully "glassy," it was a significant improvement, demonstrating that Poly AI can generate deeper product designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. A notable pro was a hover effect on the engagement chart, allowing users to see specific numbers, a detail that VZ did not include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

## VZ by Vercel: A Comparison
[[introduction_to_vercels_vz | VZ by Vercel]] is considered "probably the most well-known product in the AI designer space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It's frequently used for similar design tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

When the same prompt was given to VZ, the experience was more transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. VZ provided reasoning for its actions: "I'll create a SaaS application that helps YouTubers predict how changes to their titles, thumbnails and other elements will affect engagement. Based on the image you shared I'll design a glassy minimalist interface with colorful calls to action that allows for AB testing of YouTube content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This conversational feedback loop was a key differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

VZ's initial output was very similar to the provided image, almost a direct copy, featuring "version A," "original content title," "description," "thumbnail," and "predict performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. This direct copying was seen as a drawback, but the product felt usable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.

When asked if the design was "glassmorphic," VZ acknowledged, "You're right, the current design has some glass-like elements but doesn't fully embrace true glass morphism. Let me enhance it to create distinctive frosted glass aesthetic with more pronounced blur Effects light borders and depth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. This demonstrated VZ's ability to take feedback and refine designs, offering a more interactive and less "shouting into a dark hole" experience compared to Poly AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

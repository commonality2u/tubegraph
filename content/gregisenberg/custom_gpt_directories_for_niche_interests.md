The internet's evolution has seen significant opportunities arise from the digitization of information, leading to the creation of large-scale directories [00:22:18]. These directories, such as Nomad List, aggregate data to provide insights and recommendations for specific interests [00:22:24], like suitable cities for digital nomads [00:22:29].

## Transforming Directories with Custom GPTs

A new opportunity lies in transforming existing directory companies and websites into custom GPTs [00:22:40]. The advantage of a custom GPT is its ability to offer personalized interactions and recommendations [00:22:54].

### Benefits of Custom GPT Directories
Traditional directories provide aggregated data, but a custom GPT allows users to specify their unique needs and preferences through conversation [00:22:54]. For instance, a "Nomad List" GPT could enable users to chat about specific criteria like:
*   Desired weather conditions [00:23:00]
*   Strict budget constraints (e.g., less than $1,000 per month) [00:23:04]
*   Visa requirements for various locations [00:23:09]

This interactive approach provides a more tailored and effective information retrieval experience compared to static directories [00:23:16].

## Monetization and Viability
While the monetization of custom GPTs is still emerging [00:23:24], some instances suggest potential. One reported case involves a lawyer using top legal GPTs for lead generation, leveraging the high volume of user prompts for legal contracts to offer their services [00:23:35], [00:24:06].

For a custom GPT to be a viable business, it must offer specialized data that goes beyond what general AI models like ChatGPT or Claude can provide [00:24:25], [00:24:31]. If a custom GPT is uniquely effective at meeting specific user needs, it can potentially be monetized through:
*   Advertising [00:24:43]
*   Affiliate partnerships [00:24:43]
*   Direct sales of related products [00:24:43]

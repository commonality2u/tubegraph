From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Midjourney is considered a new medium entirely, offering a different type of canvas and a different way of problem-solving for [[Using AI in graphic design | graphic design]] and visual creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead of just paint, users can work with entire aesthetics that have layers and complexity, blending and balancing them to achieve a desired harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Once a "recipe" is found, it can be infinitely prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Moving Beyond Text Prompts
Initially, Midjourney focused heavily on words and parameters for prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. However, relying solely on semantics to drive visuals limits output to the base model's interpretation of style tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Recent updates have introduced "Style Space," "Style References," and "Character References," allowing for the explosion of aesthetics and style into almost infinite directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This shift enables a more visual approach to driving visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Midjourney Web Application
For optimal use, it is recommended to transition from Discord to the Midjourney web application at midjourney.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Key Features of the Web App
*   **Create Tab**: The primary area for generating images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Explore Tab**: A gallery of all publicly available generations, serving as a rich source of inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   **Image Search**: Clicking the search icon on any image in the Explore tab finds similar results based on subject matter and style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
    *   **"Use prompt"**: Copies the exact text prompt used for an image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   **"Use style"**: Imports an image as a style reference (indicated by a paperclip icon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
    *   **"Use image"**: Imports an image as an image prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Stealth Mode**: Available on the Pro Plan, this setting prevents your generations from appearing in the public database, crucial for client work or proprietary assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. It can be toggled in the settings of the prompt bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Liking Favorites**: Users should "like" their favorite generations using the heart icon. This helps organize and find specific images later in the "Organize" tab, especially useful given the high volume of generated images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

## Why Use Midjourney?
Midjourney serves various purposes:
*   **[[Ad inspiration and ideation using AI tools | Inspiration and Ideation]]**: It functions as a powerful tool for brainstorming ideas, putting together concepts, and exploring different visuals, similar to building a mood board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **[[Creating content with AI tools | Content Generation]]**: It can be used directly in production workflows, especially with the new editor feature for outpainting and adding elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Discovery Engine**: It helps in discovering new aesthetics and going down "rabbit holes" of exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Creative Control**: Users have significant control over the generated art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Art Therapy**: It can simply be a fun, engaging, and even therapeutic experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **[[AI tools for generating creative assets | Generating Creative Assets]]**: It allows users to take an idea and transform it into a living, breathing design asset for personal use, websites, landing pages, or social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Core Concept: Style References
Style references are images that Midjourney analyzes to understand their aesthetic qualities (colors, composition, lighting, texture, pattern) and apply them to new generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

### Image Prompt vs. Style Reference
*   **Image Prompt**: When an image is dragged into the prompt bar, it defaults to an "image prompt" (pict icon). This tells Midjourney to pull in the actual subject matter and pixels of the source image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Increasing image weight can lead to blending the source image's subject with the text prompt, potentially creating "wonky" results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
*   **Style Reference**: By clicking the paperclip icon, an image is used as a "style reference." This is a crucial distinction. Midjourney attempts to decouple the aesthetic from the subject matter, focusing on the visual style rather than the literal content of the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

### Parameters for Control
*   **Style Weight (`--sw`)**: This parameter determines how much influence the style reference has over the generation. The default is 100, but it can go up to 1000 for more pronounced stylistic influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratio (`--ar`)**: Used to control the output image's dimensions, useful for specific formats like posters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **"No" Parameter (`--no`)**: Can be used in the prompt to tell Midjourney what elements to remove from the generation (e.g., `--no text`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.

### Iteration and Refinement
Starting with a basic subject (e.g., "giraffe") and a style reference allows users to observe how Midjourney interprets the style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. From there, text prompts can be added to provide more assistance (e.g., "a paper cutout illustration of a giraffe") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. The "use" shortcut (hover and click) quickly re-adds the previous prompt for adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

### Variations and the Editor
*   **Subtle Variations**: Keep most details intact while changing minor elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
*   **Strong Variations**: Create more dramatic changes to composition while retaining the general vibe and subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.
*   **Editor**: Allows users to select and outpaint (mask out) unwanted elements within an image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

## Personalization
Midjourney's "personalization" feature allows the model to learn and fine-tune to a user's aesthetic preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. This is achieved by rating images in the "Personalize" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. The more images rated, the more Midjourney learns about preferences for colors, lighting, general style (photographic vs. illustrative), and even subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.

### Stylize Parameter (`--s`)
This parameter controls how much of Midjourney's community-curated default aesthetic is applied to the text prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. High stylize values (e.g., `--s 1000`) tend to produce images that "scream AI" or reflect the model's default "look" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. Personalization, when enabled, fine-tunes this default to the individual's taste, creating a "totally different universe" of aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. Users can also blend different personalizations by adding multiple user IDs to a prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.

## Style Reference Codes (SRF Codes)
SRF codes are unique numerical coordinates within Midjourney's multi-dimensional Style Space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. They act like a fixed point or "seed" in this space, influencing anything prompted in conjunction with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

*   **Exploration Tool**: External tools allow users to visually explore and search through thousands of SRF codes based on style, vibe, or theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.
*   **Blending SRF Codes**: Multiple SRF codes can be combined in a single prompt (e.g., `srf_code_1 srf_code_2`) to blend their unique aesthetic influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.
*   **Weighted Blending**: Specific weights can be assigned to individual SRF codes within a prompt (e.g., `srf_code_1::2 srf_code_2::1`) to control their relative influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>.

## The Process of Blending and Balancing
Creating desired aesthetics in Midjourney is about "balance and harmony" using various "aesthetic levers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. These include:
*   Style references (images or SRF codes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>
*   Text prompts (including medium, lighting, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>
*   Parameters like style weight (`--sw`) and aspect ratio (`--ar`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>
*   Personalization (influenced by image ratings and controlled by `--s`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>

The workflow involves:
1.  **Starting with a subject and potential medium** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
2.  **Using a style reference** to guide the aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
3.  **Iterating and analyzing results** to understand how Midjourney interprets the style reference and how different elements are blending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.
4.  **Adjusting parameters and text prompts** to push aesthetics in desired directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
5.  **Experimenting with variations** (subtle or strong) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
6.  **Leveraging personalization** to imbue results with individual taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.
7.  **Exploring and blending SRF codes** for more complex and unique aesthetic mixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.
8.  **Using permutation prompts** (e.g., `{value1, value2}`) to test multiple parameter values at once for quicker visual analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

This approach moves beyond a "slot machine game" of random prompting, allowing users to understand *why* certain results are generated and make guided decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>.

## Future and Application
The ability to precisely control and blend aesthetics with Midjourney has significant implications:
*   **Physical Manifestation**: Projects are underway to create physical labs where [[Using AI in graphic design | creative AI tools]] can be used alongside equipment like robots that paint, 3D printers, and large format printers, allowing digital art to be brought to life physically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.
*   **[[Creating animated visuals with AI tools like Runway | Image-to-Video Models]]**: Generated images can be imported into [[Creating animated visuals with AI tools like Runway | image-to-video models]] to create animated visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.
*   **Marketplace for Personalization/Styles**: A future marketplace for selling user-created personalizations or curated "style reference books" is being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
*   **App Functionality and Innovation**: The principles of blending aesthetics can be applied to [[Using AI tools for app functionality and innovation | app functionality and innovation]] or [[Integrating AI features in app development | integrating AI features in app development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

A core philosophy for successful companies is to prioritize creating value and better services over simply making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This approach is exemplified by a quote, originally attributed to Walt Disney and later co-opted by Facebook: "We don't make movies to make money, we make money to make more movies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Similarly, Facebook's version states, "We don't make services to make money, we make money to make better services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

While it's possible to build a multi-million dollar company with a purely mercenary approach, enduringly successful companies adopt the value-first mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Deciding on this fundamental philosophy is essential before establishing a [[monetizing_leads_and_reinvesting_in_growth | pricing strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Pricing Strategy and Value Creation

When considering pricing, especially for AI companies, a good approach is to evaluate the amount of human input and its associated cost (salary, emotional damage, frustration) that the AI saves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. Even if a task only takes a short time, the emotional toll it takes can justify a higher price for automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. A significant discount on this saved human cost can make the AI offering a "no-brainer" for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.

### Flexibility in Pricing

Contrary to the conventional wisdom that "you can always go down on price, you can never go up," it is possible to increase prices if a product genuinely creates value and is beloved by its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.

A real-world example comes from Monzo, a Neo-Bank in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>. After facing a revenue gap, they were initially hesitant to charge for services like fourth ATM withdrawals or replacement cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. However, customers found the new charges fair because they already loved the product and felt they had been receiving a valuable service for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. This demonstrates that if a product is "beautiful and people love and has a place in their life," charging more later is feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.

Similarly, companies like Uber initially offered services cheaply to get users "hooked" on the product and then gradually increased prices once customers were integrated into the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. The key takeaway is that customers remember the value they receive, not just the initial pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. By creating great value, businesses can determine the optimal pricing over time, potentially with the help of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.

## The Importance of Purpose and Meaning in Work

Choosing a startup idea should involve a "regret minimization exercise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. This involves imagining future scenarios where a valuable idea (like a global Venmo) is pursued or not, and assessing the emotional impact of each outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. For big consumer products, failure is often the default, so there is no shame in falling short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

It is crucial to work on ideas that one deeply cares about and believes are important for the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. For example, enabling instant, near-free global money transfers is seen as a transformative and worthwhile endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. If a product simply aims to make money without creating positive value or if it feels morally questionable (e.g., selling products that cause harm), even success can lead to personal dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

Finding meaning and enjoyment in work is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. The most successful products often stem from personal care and passion, rather than just market opportunity or an exit strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. A "mercenary business thing" focused solely on profit without deeper interest can lead to boredom and a lack of fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. It's about creating new things, solving interesting puzzles, and finding joy in the work itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.

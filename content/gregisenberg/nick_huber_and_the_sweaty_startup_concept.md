Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," advocates for building "boring" businesses as a path to wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. He notes that many wealthy individuals he knows, those with private jets and giant beach houses, achieved their success through "normal" and often overlooked service-based industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Examples include underground utilities, surveying companies, HVAC businesses, and real estate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Huber emphasizes that focusing on "boring" endeavors can significantly increase one's odds of becoming wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## What is a "Sweaty Startup"?

A "sweaty startup" is typically a non-tech, service-based business that involves physical labor or less glamorous operations, often overlooked by those aspiring to build software or [[AI startups and entrepreneurship | AI startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. These businesses focus on cleaning, moving, repairing, or providing essential services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. The core idea is that while they might be "hard" or "sweaty," they offer significant opportunities for profit and wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Nick Huber's Journey

Huber himself exemplified the sweaty startup concept through his own ventures:

*   **Storage Squad**
    *   A pickup and delivery storage business focused on college students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   Students' belongings were stored in a warehouse over the summer and delivered back when they returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   At its peak, Storage Squad generated approximately $2.2 million in annual revenue, with $400-$500k in annual profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   The primary marketing method was sidewalk chalk, personally written over 5,000 times by Huber in key customer traffic areas like Boston and Ithaca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
    *   The business was bootstrapped using inexpensive cargo vans bought on Craigslist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   It stored items for over 2,000 students across 35,000 square feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
    *   The business was sold in 2020 for $1.75 million with no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   Huber started with no prior experience in the storage industry, initially storing items in his own apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. He made $150 initially and had $3,000 cash three weeks after the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

*   **Self-Storage Facilities**
    *   Leveraging his experience, Huber acquired a self-storage facility in Erie, Pennsylvania, at a public auction for $625,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It was over 40,000 sq ft with 180+ units and was making only $4,000 a month in revenue due to neglect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   Another self-storage facility in North Georgia was purchased for $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. At the time of purchase, it generated $15,600-$16,000 a month in revenue, which has since increased to $40,000 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The facility is now valued at $4.5 million, representing over $2 million in increased value without complex innovations or raising external money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Examples of Sweaty Startups

Huber highlights various opportunities for [[building wealth with non tech startups | building wealth with non-tech startups]]:

*   **Lawn Care**
    *   Huber's brother runs a lawn care company, primarily marketing with bandit signs by the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
    *   He gains 30-40 new customers annually in April-May, growing his company 30% each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
    *   Last year, he made over $100,000 while working nine months a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

*   **Mobile Detailing**
    *   A mobile detailing business, "Detailed Dogs," generated $17,000 in revenue and $10,000 in profit in October 2024, translating to an annual income of $120,000 for a one-year post-college individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

*   **High-End Transportation**
    *   A friend operates a high-end transportation service to the airport with three other drivers in Atlanta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

*   **Firewood Delivery & Storage**
    *   Building simple firewood storage racks on-site for customers (costing about $100 in materials and 1.5 hours to build) allows charging $800-$1,000 for the rack and seasoned firewood delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   This could yield $1,000 profit in a day, an hourly rate of over $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
    *   It can be a subscription service for recurring revenue and an entry point for other services like lawn mowing, snow clearing, or tree work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

*   **Local Bar Advertising Network**
    *   A business owner in North Georgia charges local businesses $10 a month to display their ads on rotating TVs in 70 bars and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
    *   This generates $20,000 profit a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

*   **Putting Green Installation**
    *   A more skilled service that can yield $30,000 to $200,000 per high-end turf installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

*   **Tree Removal**
    *   Despite high risk and equipment costs, it's a lucrative business. An example given is two guys earning over $3,000 for four hours of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

*   **Christmas Light Installation**
    *   While risky, it offers significant profit. Friends pay $3,500-$4,000 for Christmas lights installed for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

*   **Other Opportunities**
    *   Deck building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>
    *   Power washing (low skill, low money entry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>
    *   Concrete work, driveway slabs, patios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>
    *   Bounce house rentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>

*   **Nanny/Night Nurse Recruiting**
    *   Huber identifies a need for local nanny recruiting companies that handle job posting, screening, background checks, and interview setup for a fee of $3,000-$5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
    *   A related idea is a dedicated platform for "night nurses" (who watch babies overnight) as there is no de facto marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The domain nightnurses.com was available for $13,000, payable at $1,100 a month for 13 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. This represents a high-value customer at the beginning of their journey, opening doors for cross-selling other products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
    *   The strategy for `nightnurses.com` would start as a "sweaty digital business," directly finding and vetting night nurses for a one-time fee (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. This hands-on approach avoids the pitfalls of building a marketplace too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

## Sweaty Digital Businesses and Domains

Huber believes that digital businesses can also be "sweaty" and that investing in premium domains is crucial. He purchased `somewhere.com` for $450,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. He argues that spending money on a domain, the "digital real estate" of a business, is an unbelievable investment, similar to spending millions on physical real estate or hundreds of thousands on property facade improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. He highlights that premium domains can significantly increase leads and value, citing his own `somewhere.com` purchase, which provided over $400,000 in value within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. He also criticizes Beehive for having a hard-to-remember domain, `b.hive.com`, which forces them to pay for ads to appear at the top of search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

## Sweaty Startups vs. Tech/AI Startups

Huber contrasts sweaty startups with the current "renaissance" of [[AI startup incubation and ideas | AI startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. He notes that while many [[AI startups and entrepreneurship | AI startups]] are emerging, a large percentage (Huber estimates 99%) will not reach profitability, and most will be a loss for the founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

He argues that founders should pick their competition wisely:
> "Hey, look, I can compete against the Stanford computer science, you know, brilliant person who got a 36 on their ACT and has 20 million of venture capital funding and has a network all over Silicon Valley. I can compete against that person or I can compete against the person in my town who has a fax machine on their desk. They have no rep employees all over the world and they actually don't answer the phone on Monday afternoon when you call to try to become their customer but they have a private jet sitting at the airport here in Athens. Like which one of those two do you want to compete with?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>

Huber's strategy is to compete in areas where the odds of winning are higher, even if the individual gains are smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. He seeks markets where competitors are less technologically advanced or less responsive, allowing for an easier path to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

Interestingly, it is suggested that some of the best [[AI startup incubation and ideas | AI startups]] might actually originate as sweaty startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. By building a strong foundation with a sweaty business, like a directory of night nurses with an email list of a million parents, it becomes easier to later integrate AI for services like payroll, transforming into a "fintech AI company" with a solid [[entrepreneurship and startup culture | entrepreneurial]] base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. This perspective views AI as a tool that enhances existing businesses, similar to how lawnmowers became tools for lawn care companies to earn more, rather than replacing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

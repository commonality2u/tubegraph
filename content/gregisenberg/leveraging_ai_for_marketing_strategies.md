This article explores a workflow designed to automate marketing tasks and create content on autopilot using AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach aims to save significant time, potentially 10 to 15 hours a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, by leveraging AI to generate top-performing content automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## The Automated Content Workflow

The presented workflow demonstrates an end-to-end automation for content creation and publishing, specifically using the NADN platform (referred to as Inaden/N8 in the transcript) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The process is broken down into several stages:

### 1. Research Phase: Data Collection

This initial stage focuses on gathering extensive context and information around a chosen niche or topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Topic Input** Users enter a topic, such as "Inaden," into a chat interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Web Scraping** The system then scrapes data from various platforms:
    *   **YouTube** It identifies and scrapes the top 20-30 YouTube videos with high engagement related to the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. These videos are then watched and transcribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   **X (formerly Twitter)** It also analyzes posts from specified accounts on X that relate to workflow automation and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Data Aggregation** All collected data, including transcribed YouTube content (hooks, titles, content) and X posts, is merged into a single large text block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This acts as the "research phase" to ensure sufficient context for the AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Tool:** [[Appify | Appify]] is used for scraping data from various internet platforms like Instagram, Amazon, TikTok, YouTube, or X, through their open APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### 2. Content Idea Generation

Following the research phase, an AI agent, powered by an OpenAI LLM, analyzes the aggregated text block to find fresh angles and content ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The goal is to generate original ideas rather than merely replicating researched content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Prompting:** The AI is instructed to create actionable content ideas strictly related to marketing, with specific requirements for:
    *   Short and clear titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>
    *   Scroll-stopping hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>
    *   Optimal content format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>
    *   Unique angles for how marketers can [[role_of_ai_in_marketing_and_business_growth | scale their efforts using AI and leveraging NAD for workflows]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>
*   **Audience Tailoring:** Instructions are included to avoid excessive technical jargon and frame the content for the specific audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The AI also considers top-performing X posts from the user's account to identify brand voice and themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### 3. Fact and Trend Research

To prevent "hallucinations" and ensure content credibility, a dedicated research agent utilizes Perplexity to find real stats, use cases, trends, insights, and frameworks relevant to the marketing angles generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Data Points:** This includes identifying marketing use cases, industry ideas, statistics, case studies, and popular opinions to enrich the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Tool:** OpenRouter is highlighted as a useful tool that allows access to multiple LLMs (like Perplexity, OpenAI, Claude) through a single node and subscription, simplifying integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### 4. Content Creation

The combined ideas and research data are fed into a content agent, which then generates the actual post. This example focuses on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **LLM Choice:** Claude 3.7 Sonnet is recommended as the best LLM for writing as of the recording, especially when armed with sufficient context and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Prompting for Quality:** Key prompting tips for creating high-quality content:
    *   **Brand Voice:** Define specific brand guidelines (e.g., authentic expertise, direct communication, confident, straightforward, avoiding jargon, direct address to reader) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
    *   **Narrative-Driven Posts:** Instruct the AI to create narrative-driven posts that provide actionable insights and takeaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
    *   **Data Relevance:** Emphasize using data only if relevant and ensuring topics are tied to the overall context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
    *   **Formatting and Style:** Explicitly instruct the AI to avoid common AI pitfalls like excessive hashtags or emojis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a> and M-dashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
    *   **Role-Playing:** Frame the LLM with a specific role, e.g., "LinkedIn content strategist and conversion copywriter," to guide its output towards direct response and conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
    *   **AIDA Framework:** Encourage the AI to follow a journey: strong hook, build interest, desire, actionable value, and a clear call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.
*   **Image Generation:** The workflow also uses the OpenAI image generation model to create a relevant image for the post, with the possibility of dynamic prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Users can store personal photos in Google Drive and have the AI randomly select one to make the content feel more natural and less AI-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

### 5. Human-in-the-Loop Review

Before publishing, the generated content undergoes a human review step.
*   **Slack Integration:** The workflow sends a link to the Google Doc containing the draft post directly to a Slack channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
*   **Editing and Approval:** Users can review and edit the content in the Google Doc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. An "approve" button in Slack allows for direct publishing to LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. This step ensures that the content meets the user's standards and authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

### 6. Publishing and Testing

Once approved, the content can be published directly to the chosen social platform.
*   **Validated Content:** A key advantage is that these posts are "validated social posts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a> because they are based on scraped, high-engagement content from YouTube and X, significantly increasing the chances of resonating with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.
*   **Testing and Optimization:** The workflow removes guesswork from content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Users can test multiple angles, refine content, and double down on what performs well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

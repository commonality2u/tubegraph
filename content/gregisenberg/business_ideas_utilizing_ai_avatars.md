Omar, a guest on the podcast, creates "incredible Disney-style content" and "Pixar-like images" using AI tools like Leonardo AI and Cling AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These visual assets can drive significant revenue for businesses, particularly in marketing, which relies on storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The episode provides a tutorial on using these AI tools and introduces various [[using_ai_for_startup_ideas | startup ideas]] that can be launched immediately to generate revenue and cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

The goal is to build full workflows using [[building_businesses_around_ai_agents | AI avatars]], enabling the creation of businesses with zero employees that can "literally print you cash" as an [[automated_business_creation_using_ai | AI SAS product]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Evolution of Business with AI

The business landscape has undergone a significant transformation in three key areas: Product, Marketing, and Operations, largely due to COVID-19 and the emergence of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Product
Traditionally, launching a product involved raising VC capital, taking years, and hiring expensive software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. With AI, products can be built instantly at low cost and with [[building_a_startup_using_ai_tools | zero employees]], eliminating the need for engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This represents a major "technical shift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Marketing
Marketing previously required social media budgets, creative teams, agencies, and seasonal campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Now, "solopreneurs" are gaining prominence by being transparent about their earnings and sharing their story daily, leading to "always-on marketing" instead of big campaigns. This signifies an "audience shift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Operations
Operational shifts include the move from physical office spaces to remote work, allowing access to global talent and reducing overhead costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Businesses can now be much leaner, building faster with fewer people, representing a "cultural shift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Sequential Prompting for AI-Driven Workflows

A third technique for [[business_applications_of_ai_prompting | using AI tools]] is "sequential prompting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This involves using one AI tool (like ChatGPT) to generate a prompt that is then fed into a second AI tool (like Leonardo AI) to create an output (e.g., an image) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This output can then be used as input for further AI tools (e.g., Cling AI for video animation, Eleven Labs for voiceovers), forming a "sequence" or "Lego bricks" of connected tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

Initially, this process should be done manually to allow for iteration and a fast feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. Once refined, these workflows can be automated using tools like Zapier or Make, or by connecting APIs programmatically for more complex integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

This approach allows individuals to perform the work of five or six people using AI tools like ChatGPT and Leonardo AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## Business Ideas Leveraging AI Avatars

### 1. AI-First Personalized Greeting Cards (Moonpig 2.0)
This idea is inspired by Moonpig.com, a personalized greeting card company generating over $400 million in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

**Process:**
*   **Generate consistent characters:** Use a structured prompt in ChatGPT, along with an uploaded image of a person (e.g., a child), to generate a detailed character description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This description maintains consistency for the character across different images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Create images:** Input the character description (prompt) into Leonardo AI to generate high-resolution, Disney/Pixar-style images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Leonardo AI's API allows for programmatic image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **Add narrative/text:** Use ChatGPT to generate image prompts that include specific actions (e.g., waving goodbye) or text overlays (e.g., "Good Luck") for storytelling purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. This allows for creating personalized "moments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.

**Business Model & Potential:**
*   **Value Proposition:** Offers compelling, animated 3D characters in a storytelling format, similar to Pixar/Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.
*   **Revenue Streams (AI-suggested):**
    *   **Premium Card Sales:** Selling cards for $5-$10, with AI-driven personalization justifying a 20-30% markup over traditional cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.
    *   **Monthly Memberships:** $10-$15/month for unlimited cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>.
    *   **Upselling Gifts:** Matching items like flowers or chocolates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.
*   **Projections:** Could generate $10 million in annual revenue by targeting 200,000 users purchasing an average of five cards annually, plus add-on sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>.
*   **User Experience:** An AI-first version would land users directly into a builder experience, allowing them to upload images, choose themes, and generate stories or cards with minimal explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>. The backend would automate the sequential prompting process via APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>.

### 2. Animated Storytelling & GIFs

*   **Cling AI:** This tool excels at transforming static images into videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Users can upload an image (e.g., generated from Leonardo AI) and use Cling AI to create moving video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.
*   **Lip Sync & Voiceovers:** Cling AI also features a dub function for lip-syncing text, allowing generated characters to speak words within the scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
*   **Potential Challenges:** Currently, generating 5-second videos takes about four minutes, making it less scalable for a video-as-a-service product immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.
*   **Opportunity:** This could be offered as a premium service with manual fulfillment by assistants, or for creating GIFs by stitching together short video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. The speed of video generation is expected to increase dramatically with future AI models like Sora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
*   **Application:** Memifying moments for social media or creating short, funny storyboards based on real-life events or photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

### 3. Personalized Stickers for Education/Incentives

This idea involves [[developing_and_testing_startup_ideas_using_ai_tools | utilizing AI]] to create customized stickers, particularly for educational settings or as personal incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.

**Process:**
*   **Character Generation:** Use ChatGPT and Leonardo AI to generate an AI avatar of a person (e.g., a teacher, a child) in a "kiss-cut sticker artwork" style with a plain background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.
*   **Background Removal:** Employ a tool like Remove.bg (or its API) to automatically remove the background, creating a transparent PNG sticker image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
*   **Automated Printing & Fulfillment:** Integrate with a print-on-demand service like Printful (which has an API) to automatically fulfill orders for physical stickers or other products (like t-shirts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. This can be connected to e-commerce platforms like Shopify for a fully automated workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>.

**Business Model & Potential:**
*   **Target Audience:** Schools (teachers as customers), or individual consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition:** Teachers could give out personalized stickers with their AI-generated face saying "Well Done" as an incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. Children could also get stickers with their own faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>.
*   **Marketing Strategy (Guerrilla Hacking):** Find staff directories on school websites, use their images to generate personalized sticker samples, and mail them to the principals to gain attention and demonstrate the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. This can go viral within the school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>. Alternatively, use AI to generate stickers from public display pictures on social media and DM users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.
*   **Scalability:** A business could run on just ChatGPT, Leonardo AI, Remove.bg, and Printful, allowing for hundreds of unique stickers without manual intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

### 4. Educational Content

*   [[utilizing_ai_for_startup_idea_generation | AI avatars]] can be used to create engaging educational content for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.
*   By creating images and stories about historical events or curriculum topics (e.g., Romans), AI can make learning more interactive and engaging than traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.
*   This could lead to a "business-to-education" (B2E) model, selling AI-powered educational systems to schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>. By researching national curricula, one could develop comprehensive systems based on specific topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

These ideas highlight the potential for [[building_competitive_ai_businesses | building competitive AI businesses]] by creating user-friendly interfaces and brands around powerful AI models, moving beyond basic prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. The speed and quality of AI-generated content offer a unique opportunity to create products that are both desired by consumers and highly scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

This article explores strategies for creating and growing consumer brands and physical products, with many lessons also applicable to software startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. It delves into evaluating market opportunities, understanding demand, distinguishing products, and effective distribution, drawing on insights from Ashwin, an expert in launching and growing consumer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Evaluating Market Opportunities and Demand

To assess market opportunities, particularly for new products or software ideas, understanding search demand and competition is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Leveraging Ahrefs for Market Insights
Ahrefs is a tool primarily used in SEO to gauge search volume and keyword difficulty for any keyword, term, or brand on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This tool is invaluable for:
*   **Evaluating Category Demand and Trends**: It helps identify rising or declining trends in specific market spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. For example, "electrolytes" shows a rising demand over the years, with seasonal peaks in June and July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Conversely, "CBD" demand, which was explosive in 2019 following the 2018 Farm Bill, has steadily declined since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   **Assessing Keyword Difficulty**: Ahrefs provides a keyword difficulty score (0-100), indicating how hard it is to rank highly on Google for a given term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. A high score, like 88 for "electrolytes", suggests significant competition and a challenging path for organic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Identifying Geographical Opportunities**: Analyzing search volume by country can reveal untapped markets. For instance, the high search volume for "electrolytes" in English-speaking Western countries (US, UK, Canada, Australia) suggests opportunities in non-English speaking regions like Germany or India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This concept aligns with the strategy of replicating proven business models in new geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Pre-Launch Validation**: Before building a product, especially software like accounting tools for vets, use Ahrefs to "gut check" if there's sufficient search volume and manageable competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This helps avoid building a product with no demand or too much existing competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

### Analyzing Competitor Sales with Particle
Particle is a tool that allows users to type in any e-commerce brand to view its sales over time, product categories, and best-selling items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. This data, typically not public for private companies, helps in:
*   **Benchmarking Competitors**: See the revenue numbers of competitors in your space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **De-risking Product Decisions**: Identify which SKUs or flavors drive the majority of a competitor's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. For example, if major players in a category primarily sell chocolate and vanilla, it suggests focusing on those core offerings first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   **Trend Exploration**: Particle also has a trend explorer feature to see how product categories are trending up or down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   **Other Sales Data Sources**: Platforms like TikTok Shop and Amazon also show sales figures, allowing insight into product competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

## The Case for Physical Product Businesses

While building a physical product business is challenging due to complexities like supply chain management, finance, and inventory forecasting, it offers a "phenomenal way to get really good at marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. The consumer product world is often at the "bleeding edge of marketing" because acquiring individual customers is harder than securing B2B software contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

## Standing Out Through Branding and Differentiation

Even with strong category demand (e.g., magnesium supplements), standing out is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. Key differentiation strategies include:

### Visual Look and Feel
Many products in a popular category might appear generic or "medical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Brands can differentiate through intentional design, packaging, and unique visual elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Moon Juice**: Uses an amber jar and distinct branding to stand out from generic white bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.
*   **Lemi**: Invested in custom bottling, unique caps, and vibrant colors to position itself to a Gen Z female audience, making supplements fun and accessible compared to purely clinical brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

### Niche Positioning and Audience Targeting
Hyper-targeting a specific niche or audience in the early stages helps achieve scale before expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.
*   **Underserved Demographics**: While many modern brands cater to millennials or Gen Z, there's a significant opportunity to create well-designed, branded products for older adults who have disposable income and are less saturated by current advertising trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

> "Everything that is in the consumer packaged world runs into this kind of like issue right where it's we had this like era of like Millennial Blanding with consumer products which is like everything kind of looks the same...and now we have the same thing happening in for Gen Z because there it's like they're the next generation of buyer so like let's make everything super bright and vibrant and saturated." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>

## Bootstrap Marketing and Design

It's possible to launch a product without significant upfront investment in agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.
*   **Independent Freelancers**: Platforms like Fiverr and Upwork allow founders to hire freelance designers for simple packaging or landing page setups at a lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.
*   **Leveraging AI Tools**: AI tools like Midjourney can generate initial design concepts (V1), which can then be refined by a freelance designer at a fraction of the cost of an agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This allows founders to clarify their vision before engaging with agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.
*   **AI for Research and Design**: Tools like Manis can conduct extensive market research, analyze competitors, and understand specific audience needs, generating detailed reports that might otherwise cost thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. This represents an "unfair advantage" for new businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.

## Relentless Research and Developing a Strong Point of View

No matter the product type, a founder must be a "relentless researcher" of the category and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Competitor Analysis**: For physical products, this involves analyzing competitors' branding, websites, and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>. For software, it means examining existing software, reviews (especially one- and two-star), and directly engaging with potential users (e.g., talking to staff at dental offices for CRM ideas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.
*   **Market Conversations**: Talking to store owners about what sells and what customers are looking for provides invaluable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.
*   **Informed Direction**: This deep research builds confidence in the brand's direction, moving beyond mere hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.

### B2B and Consumer Marketing Tactics
The speaker, Ashwin, discusses launching and growing consumer brands and previously working in the software space, hinting at overlap in [[b2b_and_consumer_marketing_tactics | B2B and Consumer Marketing Tactics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. He emphasizes that the principles of understanding market demand and competition apply across both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The core challenge in both is customer acquisition, which is harder in consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

## The Ultimate Marketing Principle

> "First time Founders focus on product, second time Founders focus on distribution." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>

The key takeaway for any new venture, whether software or physical products, is to start by working backward from distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Prioritize understanding customer acquisition channels and how to win in them *before* building the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Subpar products with incredible distribution often outperform superior products that lack a strong distribution strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. This applies to various [[modern_marketing_strategies | modern marketing strategies]], including [[marketing_strategies_for_ai_products | marketing strategies for AI products]] and [[marketing_strategies_for_new_apps | marketing strategies for new apps]], as well as [[marketing_strategies_for_local_service_businesses | marketing strategies for local service businesses]]. Building a strong [[building_a_brand_through_content | brand through content]] is also a key distribution strategy, as exemplified by Ashwin's own use of TikTok to break down brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

App developers are achieving millions of downloads by mastering TikTok, which is considered an underpriced distribution channel for consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The cost of creating and distributing content on the platform is remarkably low, making it a viable strategy for various consumer applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Leveraging E-commerce Strategies for Apps

Many successful tactics for promoting apps on TikTok are adapted from the e-commerce space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. TikTok Shop, launched in November 2022, has driven significant innovation in marketing on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### User-Generated Content (UGC) Mass Production

A key strategy involves mass-producing user-generated content (UGC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. For example, Tabs Chocolate scaled from zero to $10 million annually by hiring numerous teenage UGC creators, organizing them in a Discord server, and having them mass-produce content daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This approach was later applied to a micro-SaaS product, achieving 90%+ margins compared to 20-30% for e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### AI-Generated Content (Carousels)

Surprisingly, image-based carousels (slideshows) are proving highly effective on TikTok, despite the platform's reputation for short-form video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This format is easier to create, especially using AI tools like Midjourney for images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE] **Colostrum:**
This product uses AI-generated images with common pain points (energy, brain fog) and audio clips from popular figures, pushing traffic to Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. They found a working content format and "pump out these Midjourney stories every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE] **POV App:**
This disposable camera app uses a "strong negative hook" based on controversial wedding rules (e.g., "no kids at the wedding") to capture attention in slideshow format, with the app presented as the solution for guest photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. They also experiment with AI actors and consistently use a "cake on the face" image as a hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

While talking head videos (where an [[engaging_with_influencers_for_successful_app_promotion | influencer]] speaks directly to the camera) can have higher conversion rates due to a human connection, slideshows offer greater scale and a lower barrier to entry for creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Finding and Engaging Creators

The TikTok Shop Affiliate Center can be used to identify products selling in high volumes and the creators promoting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This allows app creators to find "top 1% of the people who know how to do that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.

The opportunity lies in convincing these creators, who are already adept at selling e-commerce products, to promote apps instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

[!TIP] **"Ride the Goalie Wave" Strategy:**
Goalie, a supplement company, monopolizes many talking-head creators by offering insane prizes (MacBook Pro, Rolex, BMW, Tesla) on top of affiliate commissions for high sales volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This makes it hard to compete for these specific creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The strategy is to find creators selling *other* e-commerce products and persuade them to promote apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

### Shifting [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_app_promotion | Influencer Marketing]] for TikTok

Traditional [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_app_promotion | influencer marketing]], focused on an influencer's built-in audience on platforms like Instagram, is less relevant for TikTok's "For You Page" algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>. On TikTok, content is shown to new accounts 95% of the time, meaning the content itself is paramount, not the creator's follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

*   **Creator Roles:** On TikTok, creators function as actors, directors, and audience-holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.
*   **Focus on Talent, Not Audience:** Businesses can "skip the audience part" and hire creators solely as actors, even those with zero followers, to be the talent in videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. This makes [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_app_promotion | influencer marketing]] on TikTok potentially "underpriced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.
*   **Creative Freedom:** Too much creative freedom can lead to influencers not selling the product, while too much brand guideline adherence makes the video feel like an ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>. The ideal is to balance these.
*   **Multiple Brand Accounts:** Companies can hire small creators and have them make new, dedicated brand accounts for specific content formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. This helps the algorithm serve content to the right audience by associating an account with a specific face/format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE] **Airbuds:** This app uses multiple brand accounts (e.g., "Lila Airbuds," "Stacy Airbuds") where each account is run by a different creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>.

## Strategies for App-Specific [[viral_marketing_and_distribution_strategies | Viral Marketing]]

### Creating Utility Apps for Existing Content Niches

Develop apps that assist creators in making content or help consumers with problems relevant to existing content niches. This can lead to free marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE] **What Colors:** This AI-powered color analysis app helps users find the best clothing and makeup for their skin tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. It leverages a simple slideshow format with a call to action to download from the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Business Model:** Single-utility apps like What Colors often use a paywall model, typically a weekly or annual subscription, after a preliminary onboarding and user engagement (e.g., face scan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Growth Driver:** The "Double Tap to Pay" UX of Apple Pay has made iOS subscriptions significantly more appealing, contributing to a boom in consumer app revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

One strategy is to build a skincare version of an app like What Colors, analyzing faces and suggesting products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. A creator selling skincare products could use the app for "before and after" videos, subtly featuring the app as a utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

### Targeting High Lifetime Value (LTV) Niches

While TikTok users are generally young, there's a wide demographic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Targeting niches with fewer creators but wealthier demographics can lead to underpriced content and high revenue per user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE] **Golf Swing Analysis Apps:**
The golf niche includes users willing to pay more for products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. An AI golf coach app that analyzes swings from a live camera view and provides tips can be highly valuable, especially compared to costly in-person lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. The iPhone's camera combined with GPT Vision APIs make this feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE] **KO (MMA Training App):**
This app helps users train in boxing and mixed martial arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. Its product demos feature a "wireframe skeleton" overlay that analyzes movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. This visually appealing format can be applied to other sports like tennis or pickleball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE] **Poker Analysis Apps:**
Poker players represent a high-value customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. An app that analyzes hand history, strategies, or provides tips for beginners could be highly monetized, filling a gap where much content is unmonetized or only promotes gambling sites/courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. Integrating the app interface briefly into gameplay videos can drive curiosity and downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

### Capitalizing on "Cult Movements"

Identifying existing "cult-like" internet movements or strong ideologies that lack a dedicated product offers significant opportunity for apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>. These movements often revolve around universal desires like health, wealth, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE] **Umax (Looksmaxing App):**
Umax capitalized on the "looksmaxing" movement, a deep internet subculture focused on improving physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>. The app scans faces, provides scores, and offers tips on improving features like jawline, skin, and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. It leverages insecurities and a strong ideology around self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE] **Crayo (Wealth/Monetization App):**
Crayo partnered with YouTubers and TikTokers who teach teenagers how to make money on short-form video platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. Initially, these creators sold expensive courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>. Crayo then productized this by offering software to automate video creation (e.g., Reddit Minecraft Parkour videos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. This appeals to the "cult of young money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

## Foundational Considerations

### The Importance of Product Quality and Retention

While [[viral_marketing_and_distribution_strategies | viral marketing and distribution strategies]] are crucial, the underlying product must be high quality and retain users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>. If a product is not retentive, it becomes akin to selling a one-time e-commerce product, losing the benefit of scalability that apps offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. Understanding metrics like LTV (Lifetime Value) and CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) is essential for effective marketing spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

### Evolution of App Discovery

Historically, the App Store featured apps, leading to millions of downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Today, discovery primarily occurs on content platforms like TikTok and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. While App Store features are less common, strong TikTok performance can still boost an app's rank, leading to long-term organic App Store downloads through search and App Store Optimization (ASO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

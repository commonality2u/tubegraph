This is excellent for quickly creating Instagram ads for products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Core Generation: Midjourney and ChatGPT

For more artistic and specific creations, the combination of Midjourney and ChatGPT is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Midjourney**: This tool excels at styling and generating artistic images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It's often the starting point for video creation as it provides the base reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
    *   **Image Prompts**: Inserting a reference photo can influence the generated image's content (e.g., a person, surfboard, greenery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
    *   **Style References**: Uploading a style image ensures that subsequent generations adopt its colors, shadows, highlights, and depth of field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Mixing different style references can lead to surprising and unique results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT**: This AI is used for highly specific image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
    *   **Prompt Engineering**: While prompting used to require advanced writing skills, ChatGPT has made it accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. It can generate detailed and sophisticated prompts from simple requests, allowing users to achieve very specific images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
    *   **Iterative Refinement**: Users can converse with ChatGPT to refine prompts, asking for zoomed-in shots or different scenes, and it will incorporate rich details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
    *   **Consistency**: ChatGPT helps create a collection of consistent images by generating prompts that tie back to an initial idea but with different elements and environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This capability is particularly useful for [[using_ai_tools_for_design | design]] branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

### Adding Motion: Runway

Once an image is generated, tools like Runway can add motion to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **Process**:
    1.  Generate an image (e.g., using Midjourney) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
    2.  Use ChatGPT to create a prompt that describes the desired motion for that image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. ChatGPT understands the tool (Runway) and formats the prompt accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
    3.  Upload the image to Runway and paste the generated prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.
    4.  Set parameters like aspect ratio (square for social media) and duration (typically 5-10 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   **Quality**: Runway is considered high-quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Challenges**: AI tools like Runway are not perfect and can sometimes produce unexpected or "weird" results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Users might need to adjust prompts and regenerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.
*   **Upscaling**: Videos can be upscaled to 4K resolution with a single click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.
*   **Continuous Shots**: To create longer, continuous videos, save the last frame of a generated video as an image, upload it as the starting point for the next video, and then stitch them together with a simple video editing tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

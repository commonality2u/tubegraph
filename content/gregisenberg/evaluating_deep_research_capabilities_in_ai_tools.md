The test aimed to identify which tool provides more comprehensive and useful insights for [[building_businesses_with_ai_tools | building a business]].

## Introduction to Deep Research in AI Tools

Deep research features in AI models, such as ChatGPT and Perplexity, go beyond quick answers, acting like a "junior analyst" to provide in-depth information on a given query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The goal is to provide comprehensive answers and actionable plans for complex tasks, such as generating startup ideas and outlining their launch and growth strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Cost Comparison

*   **ChatGPT Pro (Deep Research)**: Approximately $200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Perplexity Deep Research**: Approximately $20 per month (or free for a limited number of uses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

## The Experiment: Building an AI Startup

The core experiment involved prompting both AI tools with the same request:
"I want to create a startup. I want it to be an AI agent that focuses on a high-value niche. I want it to be defensible, not just a flash in the pan. I want you to create a zero-to-one Playbook of how you'd launch it to get customers. Give me five ideas with five playbooks on how to grow it. I'm looking for $1 million year one, $3 million year two, $5 million year three." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

Follow-up questions were also used to refine the search, clarifying preferences for industries, target markets (B2B, B2C, or individuals), AI capabilities (automation, data analysis), [[choosing_ai_tools_based_on_user_technical_expertise | technical resources]] (low-code/no-code, $5,000 or less for MVP), funding goals (cash flow vs. VC), and go-to-market strategies (viral self-serve growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[planning_before_using_ai_tools | planning before using AI tools]] and iterative prompting for optimal results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

## AI Tool Performance and Output Comparison

### Perplexity Deep Research

Perplexity was notably faster, completing its initial research while ChatGPT was still processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. It accessed a wide range of sources (up to 34+ sources) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Unlike ChatGPT, Perplexity did not ask initial clarifying questions after the first prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

#### Startup Idea 1: Legal Contract Lifecycle AI Agent

*   **Problem Space**: Corporate legal teams spend 23% of their time on manual contract review, leading to issues like version control errors and annual costs of $2.4 billion in compliance penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Defensible Solution**: An AI agent that integrates with email, SharePoint, and DocuSign; learns organizational risk thresholds; auto-redlines third-party papers; and maintains version lineage with blockchain-style audit trails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Its defensibility comes from developing institutional memory through continuous exposure to negotiation outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Growth Playbook**:
    *   **Phase 1 (Niche Validation, 90 days)**: Build a Chrome extension to record legal contract review sessions (with permission) to train the initial model. Offer free redline audits for 100 AmLaw 200 firms, targeting mid-market companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Monetization starts at $2,500/month subscription locked to specific document types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
    *   **Phase 2 (Workflow Embedding, Months 4-9)**: Integrate with legal operations platforms (e.g., Lexion, Entra) and launch a Clause Library Builder using clients' historical language. Implement usage-based pricing at $0.25 per review clause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
    *   **Phase 3 (Enterprise Scaling, Months 10-12)**: Add SOC 2 Type 2 compliance for regulated industries, develop custom connectors for ServiceNow and Salesforce CPQ, and upsell to an $8,000/month Enterprise tier with custom playbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Financial Roadmap**:
    *   Year 1: 40 clients at $2,500 MRR = $1.2 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
    *   Year 2: 150 clients at $5,000 MRR + $250k usage pay = $3.1 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
    *   Year 3: Platform fees from 300+ embedded instances = $5.4 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

#### Follow-up on Perplexity

When asked to make the legal AI idea "more non-obvious" and provide a step-by-step MVP plan under $5,000, Perplexity provided an executive summary, competitive analysis, and an "Opportunity Matrix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. It suggested niches like "Clause Genealogy" and provided a detailed MVP implementation plan with a $4,800 budget, including specific tools and phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. It also detailed a go-to-market sequence with specific ideas like free clause vulnerability audits and usage-based pricing, including monthly search volumes and CPC data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

### ChatGPT Deep Research

ChatGPT's response was significantly longer and more in-depth than Perplexity's initial output, resembling a full business plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. It initially asked clarifying questions before generating ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The generation process for ChatGPT took longer than Perplexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

#### Startup Idea 1: AI Sales Outreach Assistant

*   **Problem Space**: B2B companies (startups to mid-sized firms) need more sales pipeline without hiring extra Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
*   **Defensible Solution**: An AI-powered virtual SDR that automates prospect research and personalized outreach (email, LinkedIn). Its defensibility comes from a "Data Network Effect," learning from every interaction which messaging yields replies, building a unique data set of what works in each industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **MVP Development ($5,000 Max)**:
    *   Focus on a narrow, high-value use case, such as automating follow-up emails to warm leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
    *   The MVP could be a web app or Chrome extension where a salesperson inputs prospects or connects their CRM, and the AI generates/sends personalized emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
    *   **Cheap Build Strategy**: Use existing AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, simple UI with low-code tools, single-channel focus (email first), and a manual fallback for AI uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
    *   Estimated cost of less than $5,000 for developer time and API calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

    *   Offer a limited free tier (e.g., 50 AI-generated emails per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
    *   Leverage viral loops: prompt users to share success internally when the AI books meetings or gets replies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
    *   Content marketing (case studies, demos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>, citing examples like Jenny AI growing to $5 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.
    *   List on CRM marketplaces (e.g., HubSpot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.
*   **Monetization & Pricing**: Per-seat pricing or usage-based tiers (e.g., $100-150/month per rep for unlimited outreach), with structured plans (Basic, Team, Enterprise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.
*   **VC Readiness**: The idea is presented as having the potential to scale to $100 million ARR, with VC funding likely needed for significant scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.

#### Follow-up on ChatGPT

When asked to make the sales outreach idea "more non-obvious," ChatGPT suggested an AI platform for longtail podcasts and sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. This AI agent would streamline podcast production and bundle small podcasts for advertisers, unlocking the "longtail" podcast advertising market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. It detailed a competitive moat based on proprietary data advantage, where the AI learns content resonance and ad placement effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>. It also outlined an MVP development strategy under $5,000, focusing on an AI transcript and summary generator using tools like Whisper or AssemblyAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.

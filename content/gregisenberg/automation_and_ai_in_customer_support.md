The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is set to revolutionize customer support, leading to significant changes in how businesses interact with their clientele. This shift is anticipated to automate most customer support functions within the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

## Scope of Automation

AI will not only handle basic Tier 1 tickets but also complex, multi-step issues that previously required senior support staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. This is seen as a "no-brainer" by experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

## Benefits and Impact

Customer service quality has declined significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. AI's role will be to help users quickly resolve their needs, improving efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

Similar to how AI transformed accessing information in books, it will enable users to get immediate answers from websites and frequently asked questions (FAQs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. The majority of customer service interactions are expected to shift to chatbots that can instantly understand and respond to user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, reducing the need for traditional phone calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Public comfort with chatbots is also growing rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

Custom [[ai_agents_and_customer_service | AI agents]] and tools are projected to become more cost-effective than hiring human employees, even for small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. This extends beyond customer support to other areas, such as using tools like Vzero instead of hiring a designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

[[automation_in_sales_and_customer_interactions | Automation in Sales and Customer Interactions]], especially through concepts like "Vibe Marketing," will handle significant work in email and CRM, eliminating tedious tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.

## Job Displacement and Evolution

While the increased [[role_of_ai_in_automating_manual_processes | automation of manual processes]] by AI may lead to job displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>, it is also acknowledged that customer service agents may evolve into new roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. The focus remains on anticipating what will realistically happen rather than what ought to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.

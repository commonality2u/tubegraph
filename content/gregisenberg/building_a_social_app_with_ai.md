Developing applications with artificial intelligence (AI) tools presents a significant opportunity, especially for those willing to embrace the current challenges. While some may choose to wait until the process becomes "even easier," starting now allows for pushing the boundaries of what's possible, leading to more profitable industries and interesting niches in [[building_apps_with_ai_tools|AI websites]] and apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Those who start building now will be creating even better sites and applications by the time the process becomes simpler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Key Tools Used

Building a social app with AI involves several powerful tools:

*   **v0:** A design tool used for quickly generating and iterating on UI components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It excels at visualizing design changes in real time and building specific components efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Cursor:** An AI-first code editor that allows users to edit multiple files at once using a "composer" mode, primarily through natural language prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   **Replit:** An online integrated development environment (IDE) that simplifies the setup and deployment of web applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **Firebase:** A backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform by Google, used for user authentication, data storage, and image management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
*   **OpenAI API (ChatGPT API):** Utilized for generating dynamic content, such as steps for a startup idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

## App Concept: Startup Idea Social App

The specific application built is a community social app for a startup ideas podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Key features include:

*   User profiles where people can join and create their own profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   Ability to type in a startup idea, which then uses AI to generate actionable steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Users can rate and comment on other people's startup ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Design and Development Process

### Initial Design with v0

The process began with a simple concept thrown into v0: "create the homepage of this app" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Initial designs were often not ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, requiring iterative refinement through descriptive prompts.

For example, to match the podcast's brand, the prompt specified "make the background of the site white and have darker cards or maybe like gray cards with neon text" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This led to an overly "clowny" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, prompting further refinement to "keep the background the same but make the cards slightly gray with dark text but the header is the header text is dark blue and the checkboxes are green" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

It was found to be more effective to design one component at a time, such as a single card or a profile component, rather than trying to style the entire page simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This approach allows for more rapid iteration and prevents overwhelming the AI's context window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Organizing Designs
> In v0, it's crucial to organize work by publishing and saving links for individual components (e.g., a card, a profile component) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This allows for easy access to the generated code and helps maintain an organized workflow before diving into code editors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### Core Functionality with Cursor and Replit

The app was built using a pre-configured template on Replit, which included necessary APIs for Firebase, OpenAI, and other common functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. This template helps abstract away complex "plumbing" code that is often the hardest part for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

The initial step involved using Cursor's composer mode with a prompt to "follow the instructions in the social media path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. This path provides basic social media primitives like authentication, a home feed, liking, and commenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

#### Handling Errors and Iteration

Encountering errors is a normal part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. The recommended approach is to:
1.  Copy the error message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
2.  Paste it back into Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
3.  Click "Save All" to reflect changes on Replit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
4.  Accept changes only when there are no errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.
5.  Commit changes frequently in the Git tab to create save points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. This prevents significant loss of work if things go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

#### Implementing AI Features

To add the AI-generated steps feature, the "create post" page was modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. The prompt instructed the AI to "type out my idea and then I want AI to generate the necessary steps to do to to achieve that idea to use then I want to use open AI API to generate the next steps to achieve the idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>. This allows for dynamic generation of task lists based on user input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.

### Styling and Refinement

After core functionality, the focus shifted to aesthetics. Integrating the v0 design for the startup idea cards involved providing the code as a styling reference, specifically instructing the AI to "not use this code directly purely use it as a reference to style the startup idea component" and "do not use the exact content of the code provided but just the styling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.

One common issue encountered was the display of data, particularly when new code changes the data format. Older posts or comments might not display correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>. The solution is often to generate new content that is compatible with the updated format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>.

### Key Learnings for [[building_apps_with_ai_tools|Building Apps with AI Tools]]

*   **Be Specific in Prompts:** Always describe the current situation first, then explicitly state what you want the AI to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. Imagine explaining it to an intern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.
*   **Visual Communication:** Use screenshots and annotation tools (like Cleanshot X) to illustrate design issues or desired changes directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.
*   **Context Management:** Resetting Cursor's composer mode for new features prevents overwhelming the AI's context window, leading to better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>.
*   **Embrace Errors:** Errors are part of the learning process. Copying and pasting them, or even asking the AI to "teach me" about the problem, accelerates understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
*   **Iterate and Save:** Frequent saving and committing changes are crucial. If a set of changes leads to a "failure loop," discard them and try a different strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Functionality:** While design is important, focus on getting core functionality working first. A functional, albeit visually simple, product is more valuable than a beautiful non-functional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.
*   **Learn from Others:** Observing how others approach problems and solve errors can significantly speed up your own learning curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:30">[01:28:30]</a>.

### Future Outlook and Community

The ability to rapidly prototype and deploy functional applications in a matter of hours or days marks a significant shift in software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>. This new paradigm could lead to "the TikTok of social of applications," where users can easily create and remix web experiences, similar to how content is shared and modified on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:36">[01:25:36]</a>. This makes it easier to test startup ideas and build a minimal viable product (MVP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

A community for "senior software composers" has been established to support people in [[building_apps_with_ai_tools|building apps with AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>. This community focuses on providing basic educational content and guidance to help everyone create and deploy web applications they love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:12">[01:39:12]</a>.

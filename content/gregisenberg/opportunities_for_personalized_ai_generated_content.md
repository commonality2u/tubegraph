Omar discusses the immense opportunities for creating personalized, revenue-driving content using various AI tools. This approach leverages AI for storytelling and the rapid generation of unique assets, opening doors for new business models and efficient operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Shift in Business with AI

The landscape of business, particularly in tech products, has undergone a massive transition, influenced significantly by COVID-19 and [[the_role_of_ai_in_writing_and_content_creation | AI itself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Traditional Business Playbook
Historically, product development involved raising VC capital and took years to launch, often requiring the hiring of expensive software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Marketing necessitated a social media budget and creative teams or agencies, often centered around seasonal, big campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Operations relied on hiring talent for productivity and often required physical office spaces, leading to dragged-out product cycles and higher costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### The AI-Driven Business Landscape
Recent shifts have transformed these areas:
*   **Product (Technical Shift)**: [[content_creation_tools_and_ai_technology | AI]] allows for instant product building at low cost and with zero employees, eliminating the need for extensive engineering teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Marketing (Audience Shift)**: The rise of solo entrepreneurs, who are transparent about their earnings and share their stories daily, has led to "always-on marketing" instead of campaign-based approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This approach is empowering and engaging for audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Operations (Cultural Shift)**: Remote working has become prevalent, allowing businesses to access global talent and operate with less staff, leading to faster, leaner development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

Today, individuals can perform the work of five or six people using [[content_creation_tools_and_ai_technology | AI tools]] like ChatGPT and Leonardo AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## Sequential Prompting: A New AI Technique
Omar introduces "sequential prompting" as a third way to use [[using_ai_for_content_creation | AI tools]], in addition to conversational use and master prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### How it Works
Sequential prompting involves using one AI tool (like ChatGPT) to generate a prompt for another AI tool (like Leonardo AI), and then potentially taking that output to another tool for further processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
1.  **ChatGPT for Prompt Generation**: ChatGPT can be used to generate specific prompts based on an image input or textual description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
2.  **Leonardo AI for Image Generation**: The prompt generated by ChatGPT is then fed into Leonardo AI to create high-quality, Pixar-style images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
3.  **Cling AI for Video Animation**: Images from Leonardo AI can be uploaded to Cling AI to turn them into short animated videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Cling AI also offers a "dub" feature for lip-syncing characters to spoken words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
4.  **Eleven Labs for Voiceovers**: Voiceovers can be added to videos using Eleven Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
5.  **Remove.bg for Background Removal**: For products like stickers, Remove.bg can automatically remove backgrounds from images, creating PNG files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

This process, while initially manual for refinement, can be automated using tools like Zapier or Make, or by connecting APIs programmatically for a seamless user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.

## Business Ideas Leveraging AI Avatars and Sequential Prompting

### 1. AI-First Personalized Greeting Cards and Memes (Moonpig 2.0)
The concept involves creating an AI-first version of services like Moonpig.com, which specializes in personalized greeting cards and generates hundreds of millions in revenue annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

*   **Process**:
    *   Users upload an image (e.g., a child's photo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
    *   ChatGPT analyzes the image and generates a detailed character prompt, ensuring consistency for storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.
    *   This prompt is fed to Leonardo AI to create Pixar-style images of the character in various scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
    *   Cling AI can then animate these images into short video clips or GIFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>.
    *   Text overlays can be added to personalize messages, turning everyday moments into animated stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: Offers premium card sales with a markup due to [[using_ai_to_simplify_content_consumption_and_creation | AI-driven personalization]], monthly memberships for unlimited cards, and upsells for gifts like flowers or chocolates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.
*   **Market**: Leverages the human desire for storytelling and the universal appeal of Disney/Pixar animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Can be used for invites, funny shared moments among friends, or custom memes reacting to current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

### 2. Personalized AI-Generated Stickers
This idea involves creating custom stickers featuring personalized AI avatars, catering to niche markets like schools.

*   **Concept**: Teachers could use AI-generated stickers of themselves saying "well done," or students could earn stickers with their own faces as incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.
*   **Process**:
    *   ChatGPT generates a "kiss cut sticker artwork" prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
    *   Leonardo AI creates the image based on the character and desired scene (e.g., winning a soccer game) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.
    *   Remove.bg automatically removes the background, creating a transparent PNG sticker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
*   **Fulfillment**: These digital assets can be integrated with DropShipping tools or third-party printing APIs like Printful, allowing for automated printing and fulfillment of physical products like stickers or even clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
*   **Marketing Strategy**: "Gorilla marketing" involves identifying school staff online, generating a personalized sticker using their image, and mailing it to them to capture attention and go viral within the school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.

### 3. AI-Powered Educational Content
AI can transform educational materials into engaging, personalized experiences.

*   **Concept**: Create interactive stories and images based on school curricula, making learning more engaging for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. For example, learning about the Romans through personalized AI-generated stories and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: A "Business to Education (B2E)" model, selling to schools as a system to enhance curriculum engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.

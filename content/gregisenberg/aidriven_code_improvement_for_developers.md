AI agents are beginning to replace tasks previously done by teams of people, and one significant area of opportunity lies in building businesses around these agents to automate and enhance technical processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The core idea is to leverage technology to perform human skill-based tasks reliably and efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## The Need for Automated Code Refactoring
Many developers, especially [[role_of_ai_in_simplifying_the_coding_process | solo founders]] and those operating with limited resources, find themselves wearing many hats, some of which they don't enjoy or excel at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Even highly skilled developers acknowledge that "this code could be better," often due to time or other constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. The constant need for code maintenance, error checking, and [[optimizing_aienhancements_in_web_development | performance optimization]] can be a significant drain on time and resources.

## Silent Constant Refactoring as a Service
A proposed solution is a "silent constant refactoring as a service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This service would connect to a codebase repository and continuously perform several critical functions:
*   **Error Checking and Linting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>: It would check for errors, lint the code, and analyze it for syntax or logic errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
*   **Suggesting Fixes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>: Similar to existing tools like Sentry, it could suggest fixes and even create pull requests for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Sentry, an error tracking tool, already has a beta feature that identifies errors, suggests fixes, and creates pull requests for developers to accept or deny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. This is possible because Sentry has access to errors, the codebase, past errors, and fixes from other clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
*   **Continuous Code Improvement**: Beyond error fixes, the tool would constantly strive to improve the code. It would take a module, assess how it could be better, make changes, and then simulate how the application would work with those changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
*   **Performance Testing**: It would run unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests in a simulated environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. If a change doesn't lead to improvement (e.g., makes the code slower), it discards the idea and tries another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. This iterative process of optimization, testing, and simulation would run continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.
*   **Roadmap Integration**: The tool could even connect to the developer's roadmap to proactively improve database schemas, codebases, documentation, and models to facilitate future feature implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.
*   **Autonomous Developer**: The ultimate vision is an autonomous developer that constantly works to make things better, presenting fully developed, tested, and commented code choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

> "The thing is just constantly scanning my code new features that I put in Old features that are already there and tells me this could be improved this could be improved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>

This concept aligns with [[aibased_feature_enhancements_in_software_development | AI-based feature enhancements in software development]].

## Business Model and Pricing Considerations
The pricing model for such a service could vary:
*   **Per Connected Repository**: Charging based on the number of repositories connected to the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.
*   **Computational Cost**: The primary expense would be the computational cost of running the AI agent, including text analysis, LLM processing, context building, and embeddings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. Running tests and spinning up instances (e.g., on AWS) would also add to the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
*   **Cadence of Experiments**: Pricing could also be based on how often new experiments are run (e.g., once a day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.
*   **ROI-Based Pricing**: The service could be priced based on the return on investment (ROI) it provides. If it can replace the work of multiple full-time developers, which could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars annually, then a substantial price might be justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. For example, if it saved millions by optimizing infrastructure or reducing costs, the price could reflect that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.
*   **Tiered Approach**: A bootstrapping approach would involve starting with basic features like static analysis, error analysis, and linting at a lower price point (e.g., $50-$100 a month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. As more capabilities are added, the price could increase due to higher computational costs and the potential risks of more experimental changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook
One of the [[challenges_and_tips_in_aidriven_app_creation | challenges]] is building a model specific enough for a niche while keeping costs down. Training specialized models can be expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. General models (like GPT-4) can do many things well, but specialized models (like Cursor for coding) perform significantly better for specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

Building an MVP that streamlines existing manual processes (like going to ChatGPT for individual tasks) could be a starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. This would involve unifying information, embedding documents, and making conversations in one place, serving as an iterative design approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

There are also philosophical considerations, such as the moralistic and operational arguments about a machine dictating or performing tasks autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. Concerns about "super intelligence" potentially creating backdoors also highlight the need for human oversight and sanity checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.

Despite the challenges, the current environment is favorable for building such AI-based businesses. Companies like Sentry are already moving in this direction, and a startup focusing on this niche could either grow to compete or be acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. Demonstrating initiative in AI-driven development through such projects can also be an effective way to get noticed by larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

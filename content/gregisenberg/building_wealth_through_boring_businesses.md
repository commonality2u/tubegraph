From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Many wealthy individuals achieve their financial success by establishing and operating "boring" or "sweaty" businesses, rather than exclusively pursuing high-tech ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These types of businesses, often overlooked, can significantly increase one's odds of becoming "really rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Characteristics of "Boring" Businesses
Wealthy individuals, some owning private jets and giant beach houses, frequently attribute their success to ventures in mundane sectors such as underground utilities, surveying, HVAC services, or real estate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The key lies in choosing to compete in markets where the competition is less fierce, often characterized by outdated practices or poor customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

## Case Study: Nick Huber's Journey
Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," shares his path to wealth through such businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Storage Squad
Huber started a pickup and delivery storage business called Storage Squad, serving college students who needed to store belongings over the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Revenue & Profit**: At its peak, Storage Squad generated approximately $2.2 million in annual revenue, with a profit of $400,000-$500,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Marketing Strategy**: The primary marketing method was sidewalk chalk, placed in high-traffic student areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This low-cost, targeted approach involved writing the ad over 5,000 times personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Paid ads were not used until the business exceeded $2 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping**: The business was bootstrapped, initially using a $1,500 cargo van purchased on Craigslist and a $2,200 box truck from Chicago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Origin**: The idea stemmed from an unexpected request when Huber posted an ad to lease his apartment, and someone wanted to store items in it instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Profitability**: The business was profitable from day one, with $3,000 cash earned within three weeks of conception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Exit**: Storage Squad was sold in 2020 for $1.75 million with no debt, split between Huber and his partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Self-Storage Facilities
Leveraging the success of Storage Squad, Huber and his partner transitioned into owning and operating self-storage facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **First Acquisition**: In 2019, they bought a 40,000+ square foot facility in Erie, Pennsylvania, for $625,000 at a public auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This neglected property was generating only $4,000 a month and had over 100 abandoned units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Second Acquisition**: A self-storage facility in North Georgia was purchased for $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Its revenue grew from $15,600-$16,000 a month to $40,000 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: This facility is now worth $4.5 million, representing a $2 million increase in value without any "spectacular" inventions or fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Other "Sweaty Startup" Ideas
Huber highlights numerous other low-tech, high-profit opportunities:

*   **Lawn Care Company**: His brother's lawn care business uses bandit signs for marketing, acquiring 30-40 new customers annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. It makes over $100,000 a year, allowing the owner to work nine months and spend two months fishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Mobile Detailing Business**: One entrepreneur earned $10,000 profit from $17,000 revenue in a single month, just one year out of college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **High-End Airport Transportation**: A friend runs a successful service with three other drivers in Atlanta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Firewood Delivery & Rack Building**: By delivering seasoned firewood and building custom racks on-site (at about $100 material cost), one could charge $800-$1,000 per delivery and make $1,000 profit in a day, over $100 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This could also evolve into a subscription service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> and an entry point for other services like lawn mowing or tree work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **In-Bar Digital Advertising**: An individual in North Georgia charges businesses $10 a month to display their ads on rotating TVs in 70 local bars and restaurants, netting $20,000 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Putting Green Installation**: A higher-skilled service that can yield $30,000 to $200,000 for high-end turf installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Tree Removal**: Despite high risk and equipment costs, two guys can make over $3,000 for four hours of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Christmas Light Installation**: Customers pay $3,500-$4,000 for seasonal light installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Deck Building**: A significant construction service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Power Washing**: An accessible entry point with minimal skill or capital required, for cleaning concrete, furniture, or decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Concrete Work**: Driveway slabs and patios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Bounce House Rentals**: A popular rental business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Nanny/Night Nurse Recruiting**: A proposed idea for a local recruiting company to help families find nannies or night nurses, potentially charging $3,000-$5,000 per placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

### The Night Nurse.com Idea
This concept, discussed by the podcast host, involves creating a dedicated directory and service for night nurses.
*   **Problem**: There is no de facto marketplace specifically for night nurses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Solution**: Acquire a premium domain like NightNurses.com (available for $13,000 or lease-to-own for $1,100/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: Start by directly recruiting and vetting night nurses for families, charging a one-time fee (e.g., $1,000 cash) for placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. This could generate $20,000 a month revenue by placing 20 nurses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.
*   **Expansion**: Leverage the initial service to build an email list of parents, offer affiliate revenue from product reviews, and eventually expand into other services like nanny recruiting or even a fintech payroll provider for caregivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## The Value of Premium Domains
Purchasing a premium domain name is considered digital real estate that can be a valuable investment for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Nick Huber invested $450,000 in `somewhere.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
*   **Cost vs. Value**: While many are hesitant to spend more than a few hundred dollars on a domain, businesses often spend millions on physical real estate or thousands monthly on leases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. A strong domain can pay for itself quickly through increased leads and organic traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.
*   **AI Prioritization**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to prioritize .com domains over others like .io or .co <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.
*   **Brand Recall**: Easy-to-spell and memorable domains prevent the need for costly paid advertisements to be found (e.g., `[[building_a_cashflowing_email_business_on_beehiiv | Beehiiv]]`'s domain issue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

## Sweaty Startups vs. AI Startups
While there's a "golden renaissance" of [[building_businesses_with_ai_technology | AI startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>, the vast majority of them fail. It's estimated that 93% of AI startups may not reach profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.
*   **Competition**: Competing in the tech/AI space means going against highly skilled individuals with significant venture capital funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. In contrast, "boring" businesses often compete with less sophisticated local players who may not even answer their phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **Odds of Success**: Choosing to compete with "less brilliant" or "dumb people" significantly increases the odds of winning and making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This aligns with the concept of [[building_sustainable_businesses_with_minimal_competition | building sustainable businesses with minimal competition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   **AI as a Tool**: The best [[building_businesses_with_ai_technology | AI startups]] may actually begin as sweaty startups, using AI as a tool to enhance traditional services, not replace them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. For example, a night nurse recruiting service could later integrate AI for payroll or vetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>. Just as the lawn mower made lawn care companies more profitable, AI can become a tool for "boring" businesses rather than disrupting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

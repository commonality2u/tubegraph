Many wealthy individuals attain their fortunes through "boring, sweaty businesses" rather than high-tech ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. According to Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," most affluent people he knows, including those with beach houses and private jets, have built their wealth from ordinary businesses like underground utilities, surveying companies, HVAC businesses, or real estate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42">[01:42]</a>. To increase the odds of getting rich, it's often advisable to pursue something "normal" and "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05">[02:05]</a>.

## Nick Huber's Journey: The Sweaty Startup Path

Nick Huber's personal journey illustrates the potential of [[bluecollar_startups_and_growth_strategies | boring businesses]]. He started a pickup and delivery storage business called Storage Squad while in college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17">[02:17]</a>.

### Storage Squad
*   **Concept**: Storing students' boxes in a warehouse over the summer and returning them when they moved back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26">[02:26]</a>.
*   **Growth**: At its peak, the business generated $2.2 million in annual revenue, making $400-$500k a year in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34">[02:34]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: Primarily relied on sidewalk chalk, identifying where customers walked and lived to place ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54">[02:54]</a>. Nick personally wrote the ad "Need storage squad.com. $29.99 per box all summer" over 5,000 times on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22">[03:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28">[03:28]</a>. They didn't use paid ads until 2017 when revenue exceeded $2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50">[02:50]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping**: Started with a $1,500 cargo van bought on Craigslist and a $2,200 box truck from Chicago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44">[03:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48">[03:48]</a>.
*   **Exit**: Sold the business in 2020 for $1.75 million, debt-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19">[04:19]</a>.
*   **Origin**: The idea came spontaneously when someone asked to store items in his apartment after he posted an ad to lease it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44">[04:44]</a>. He was profitable from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06">[05:06]</a>.

### Self-Storage Facilities
Leveraging the success of Storage Squad, Nick and his partner transitioned into self-storage:
*   **First Acquisition**: In 2019, they bought a self-storage facility in Erie, Pennsylvania, at a public auction for $625,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30">[05:30]</a>. It was neglected, generating only $4,000 a month in revenue, with over 100 abandoned units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43">[05:43]</a>.
*   **Second Acquisition**: They bought another self-storage facility in North Georgia for $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09">[06:09]</a>.
    *   **Growth**: Revenue increased from $15,600 a month to $40,000 a month today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16">[06:16]</a>.
    *   **Value**: The facility is now worth $4.5 million, a $2 million increase from their purchase price, and they own it outright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22">[06:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32">[06:32]</a>.
*   These ventures required no spectacular inventions or fundraising, just consistent effort in plain sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24">[06:24]</a>.

## Examples of Profitable Sweaty Startups

Nick Huber highlights various "sweaty startups" that are often overlooked but highly profitable:

*   **Lawn Care Company**: Nick's brother uses simple bandit signs for marketing, gaining 30-40 new customers annually in April-May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32">[07:32]</a>. He made over $100,000 last year working nine months and spent two months fishing in Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44">[07:44]</a>.
*   **Mobile Detailing Business**: Jack from "Detailed Dogs" generated $17,000 in revenue and $10,000 in profit in a month, earning an annual income of $120,000 one year out of college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57">[07:57]</a>.
*   **High-End Transportation**: Nick's friend Jude runs a service with three other drivers in Atlanta, providing high-end airport transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18">[08:18]</a>.
*   **Firewood Delivery**: An opportunity exists to charge $800-$1,000 for seasoned firewood delivered with custom-built, onsite storage racks, making over $1,000 profit in a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40">[08:40]</a>. This could also be a subscription service with recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31">[09:31]</a> and an entry point for other services like lawn mowing, snow clearing, or tree work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41">[09:41]</a>.
*   **Bar TV Advertising**: A business owner in North Georgia nets $20,000 a month by placing rotating ads on TVs in 70 bars and restaurants, charging businesses $10 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11">[10:11]</a>. This fosters local business loyalty and can drive bar revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07">[11:07]</a>.
*   **Putting Green Installation**: A higher-skilled business with potential to earn $30,000 to $200,000 per high-end turf installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40">[11:40]</a>.
*   **Tree Removal**: Despite risks and equipment costs, it's highly profitable. A two-man, four-hour job can bring in over $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54">[11:54]</a>.
*   **Christmas Light Installation**: A risky but lucrative business, with friends paying $3,500-$4,000 for a few rows of lights for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17">[12:17]</a>.
*   **Power Washing**: An easy entry point for those with little skill or money, cleaning concrete, furniture, and decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54">[12:54]</a>.
*   **Concrete Work**: Driveway slabs and patios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04">[13:04]</a>.
*   **Bounce House Rentals**: A profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08">[13:08]</a>.

### The "Night Nurses.com" Idea: A Sweaty Digital Business

A specific idea for a [[profitable_startup_ideas | profitable startup idea]] is a nanny/night nurse recruiting company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22">[13:22]</a>.

*   **Problem**: Difficulty in finding and vetting qualified nannies/night nurses. Existing marketplaces like Care.com are too broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22">[13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30">[15:30]</a>.
*   **Solution**: A specialized directory and recruiting service.
    *   **Service**: Post jobs, screen candidates, conduct background checks, set up interviews, and provide high-quality referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32">[13:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36">[27:36]</a>.
    *   **Payment**: Charge a one-time fee of $1,000-$5,000 per placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40">[13:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:32">[27:32]</a>.
    *   **High-Value Customer**: Parents seeking night nurses are high-value customers at the beginning of their parenthood journey, opening doors for cross-selling other baby/home outfitting services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03">[15:03]</a>.
*   **Domain**: "NightNurses.com" is available for $13,000, which can be leased-to-own for $1,100 a month for 13 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23">[16:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40">[16:40]</a>.
    *   **Strategy**: Build an AI-powered directory, blog for organic traffic and product reviews, and advertise on popular pregnancy apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50">[16:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05">[17:05]</a>.
    *   **Sweaty Digital Aspect**: While digital, it requires significant effort in recruiting, starting locally in one town or neighborhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11">[18:11]</a>.

## The Importance of Domain Names (Digital Real Estate)

Nick Huber emphasizes that a strong domain name is like digital real estate and an unbelievable investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01">[20:01]</a>. He spent $450,000 on "somewhere.com" (formerly supportsheepard.com) and considers it to have already delivered more than $400,000 in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54">[18:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47">[20:47]</a>.

*   Many businesses spend heavily on physical real estate (e.g., $250,000 to redo a storage facility facade) but are hesitant to spend a few hundred dollars on a domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26">[19:26]</a>.
*   Good `.com` domains are likely to be prioritized by Large Language Models (LLMs) over other extensions like `.io` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10">[20:10]</a>.
*   A memorable domain can significantly increase leads. For example, if a lead is worth $300, getting 10 extra leads a month from a strong domain would generate $3,000, easily covering a $1,100 monthly lease-to-own payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23">[20:23]</a>.

## Sweaty Startups vs. AI Startups

While the current era sees a "renaissance" of AI startups, Nick Huber argues that **[[bluecollar_startups_and_growth_strategies | sweaty startups]]** offer a higher probability of success for most entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41">[22:41]</a>.

*   **High Failure Rate of AI/Tech Startups**: Most tech and AI startups fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49">[23:49]</a>. Nick estimates 99% won't reach profitability, with 90% being a loss for the founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06">[24:06]</a>.
*   **Competition**: In AI, one competes against brilliant computer science graduates with millions in venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:27">[24:27]</a>. In contrast, **[[bluecollar_startups_and_growth_strategies | sweaty startups]]** compete against established local businesses that may be technologically behind (e.g., still using fax machines, not answering phones, no remote employees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40">[24:40]</a>.
*   **Odds of Winning**: Choosing to compete in a less competitive market significantly increases the odds of success and profitability, even if the "prize" (e.g., $30,000/month) is smaller than the potential billion-dollar exits of tech giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01">[25:01]</a>.
*   **AI as a Tool**: AI can serve as a tool for [[bluecollar_startups_and_growth_strategies | boring businesses]] to enhance efficiency and profitability rather than being the core business itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:11">[26:11]</a>. Just as the lawnmower made lawn care companies more profitable, AI can make business owners more money without necessarily creating successful AI companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34">[28:34]</a>.

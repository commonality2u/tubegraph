Many wealthy individuals achieve their financial success through "boring, sweaty businesses" rather than high-tech startups [00:00:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These businesses often involve physical labor or traditional services, and they offer significant opportunities for wealth creation [00:00:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," emphasizes that increasing one's odds of getting rich can often come from doing something "normal" and "boring" [00:02:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## What Are Boring Businesses?

Boring businesses are typically non-glamorous, service-oriented ventures that involve cleaning, moving, repairing, or similar manual work [00:29:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Unlike software or AI startups, they don't usually require venture capital or groundbreaking innovation [00:02:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, [00:24:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

Common [[examples_of_successful_boring_businesses | examples of successful boring businesses]] include:

*   Nanny recruiting [00:13:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>

## Why Pursue Boring Businesses?

Wealthy individuals often choose these less glamorous ventures because they offer a higher probability of success and significant financial returns [00:02:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Reduced Competition** Many traditional service businesses face less competition, particularly from highly skilled tech entrepreneurs [00:24:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Competitors in these fields may lack modern business practices, such as answering phones or effective rate management [00:24:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>, [00:25:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
*   **High Profitability** Many of these businesses can generate substantial profits. For instance, a mobile detailing business made $10,000 in profit in a single month [00:08:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Tree removal can yield over $3,000 for just four hours of work with two people [00:12:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping Potential** Most boring businesses can be [[monetization_and_building_sustainable_businesses | bootstrapped]] with minimal initial capital [00:29:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>, making them accessible even without significant resources or the need to raise money [00:03:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, [00:03:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Tangible Value** These businesses provide essential services that people are willing to pay for, often at a premium for convenience or quality [00:09:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, [00:12:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## Nick Huber's Journey: From Storage Squad to Self-Storage

Nick Huber's personal journey exemplifies how to [[steps_to_achieving_10_million_liquid_net_worth | build wealth]] through "sweaty startups."
*   **Storage Squad** Huber started a pickup and delivery storage business for college students called Storage Squad [00:02:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. He got the idea when someone wanted to store items in his apartment instead of leasing it [00:04:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   At its peak, Storage Squad generated $2.2 million in annual revenue, with $400,000-$500,000 in annual profit [00:02:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   The business was sold in 2020 for $1.75 million with no debt [00:04:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   It was profitable from day one [00:05:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Self-Storage Facilities** Leveraging the experience from Storage Squad, Huber and his partner invested in self-storage facilities [00:04:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
    *   One facility in Erie, Pennsylvania, was bought for $625,000 and made $4,000 a month in revenue, with over 100 abandoned units [00:05:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   Another facility in North Georgia, purchased for $1.5 million with $15,600 a month in revenue, now generates $40,000 a month and is worth $4.5 million [00:06:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This success was achieved without inventing anything or raising money [00:06:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Effective Marketing for Sweaty Startups

[[Building and leveraging lead generation | Lead generation]] for boring businesses often relies on simple, direct, and cost-effective methods:
*   **Sidewalk Chalk** For Storage Squad, Huber personally wrote ads on sidewalks over 5,000 times in areas where customers frequently walked [00:02:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This was the primary marketing method until the business reached over $2 million in revenue [00:02:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Bandit Signs** Huber's brother runs a lawn care company that acquires 30-40 new customers annually just by placing bandit signs on the side of the road [00:07:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Local TV Ads** A friend in North Georgia operates a network of digital screens in 70 bars and restaurants, charging businesses $10 a month to display their ads. This business nets $20,000 a month [00:10:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This model fosters loyalty from local business owners who enjoy seeing their ads displayed [00:11:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## [[Startup_ideas_for_profitable_service_businesses | Startup Ideas for Profitable Service Businesses]]

Beyond the examples from Huber's own experience, he highlights several other potential "sweaty startup" ideas:
*   **Firewood Delivery with Custom Racks** Delivering seasoned firewood and building on-site firewood racks can be highly profitable, with potential earnings of $1,000 profit for two deliveries in a day [00:08:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This could even evolve into a subscription service [00:09:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> and an entry point for other services like lawn mowing or tree work [00:09:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Nanny/Night Nurse Recruiting** Identified as a high-demand service, especially for new parents [00:13:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Customers are willing to pay $3,000-$5,000 for a recruiting company to handle job postings, screening, and background checks [00:13:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. A night nurse typically cares for a baby from 11 PM to 5 AM, allowing parents to sleep [00:14:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

## Digital "Sweaty" Startups: NightNurses.com Example

A digital business can still be "sweaty" by focusing on a specific service niche and providing direct value [00:18:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
*   **NightNurses.com** The idea is to create a definitive directory or service for night nurses [00:14:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
    *   The domain NightNurses.com was available for $13,000, or $1,100 a month for 13 months via lease-to-own [00:16:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
    *   **Value of a Domain:** Investing in a good domain name is seen as an "unbelievable investment" and "digital real estate" [00:20:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. It can increase leads and provides long-term value [00:20:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. Nick Huber paid $450,000 for Somewhere.com [00:18:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** Start by offering a direct service â€” finding, vetting, and background-checking night nurses for a one-time fee (e.g., $1,000 cash) [00:27:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. This avoids the pitfalls of trying to launch a two-sided marketplace too soon [00:28:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.
    *   **Expansion:** Once a strong service foundation is built with a customer base, the business can expand into related services, potentially [[monetization_and_building_sustainable_businesses | monetizing]] through payroll providers or affiliate product reviews, effectively transforming into a "fintech AI company" with a "sweaty startup" foundation [00:26:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>, [00:27:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

## Comparing to Tech and AI Startups

While the current era sees a "renaissance" of AI startups, the success rate of these ventures is often very low [00:23:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>, with 93% or even 99% failing to reach profitability [00:23:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.
*   **Competition:** Tech startups often compete against brilliant, well-funded individuals in Silicon Valley [00:24:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. Boring businesses, conversely, compete against less sophisticated local players [00:24:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **AI as a Tool:** Instead of building a pure AI startup, it's suggested that the best [[building_automated_businesses_with_AI | AI startups]] might actually begin as [[building_vertical_saas_businesses | sweaty startups]] [00:26:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. AI can be a tool to make service businesses more efficient and profitable, similar to how lawnmowers made lawn care companies more lucrative rather than eliminating them [00:28:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. AI can benefit business owners by improving processes and increasing profits over time [00:28:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

I can compete against that person or I can compete against the person in my town who has a fax machine on their desk...'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>

To ensure a directory idea is worthwhile, it's crucial to validate it before committing significant resources to building it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. John Rush emphasizes that starting an online directory is one of the lowest-risk ways to launch a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, especially during what he calls the "Golden Era of directories," where people increasingly seek curated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Step 1: Idea Generation and Keyword Research

The best approach to finding a viable directory idea is to begin with [[seo_strategies_for_directories | keyword research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This method helps determine if there's an existing search demand for certain terms and phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Using Google Keyword Planner
Google's Keyword Planner tool, typically used for ad planning, is effective for checking traffic volume for keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. John Rush spends hours daily testing random ideas in this tool to gauge traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

For example, when considering a directory for startup ideas:
1.  **Search Volume**: Searching "business ideas" in Keyword Planner reveals nearly 1 million searches per month globally (in English) with low competition for ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This indicates strong demand.
2.  **Domain Name Matching**: It's beneficial for the directory's domain name to match the target keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. For instance, a directory named "nextjsstarters.com" saw significant traffic due to its exact keyword match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
3.  **Finding Available Domains**: Use tools like GoDaddy to check domain availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. If the exact match is taken, explore variations that convey the same meaning, such as "small business ideas," "little business ideas," or "online business ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Google now prioritizes the *meaning* of keywords over exact word matches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. John successfully acquired "minibusinessideas.com" for $9 after testing "tiny" and "micro" variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Step 2: Rapid Prototyping and Initial Promotion

The philosophy for [[how_to_validate_a_startup_idea | validating startup ideas]] is to do "as little as possible" to test assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. If an assumption proves successful, then more time and resources can be invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

### Building the Directory
Instead of coding, John recommends using no-code platforms to build directories quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This allows for faster launches and easier marketing activities like A/B tests, marketing pages, and programmatic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. He uses his own tool, Unicorn Platform, which has pivoted into a directory builder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

When launching:
*   **Simplicity is Key**: The initial version of a directory should be simple, focusing only on the items themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Features like ratings or user accounts can be added later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Leverage AI for Content**: Tools like AI can generate basic menu structures, text, subtitles, and even FAQ sections quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. FAQs are particularly valuable for SEO, as each question can correspond to a potential Google search query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Search Google with "how do I..." to find common user questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, then use AI to create answers for these "fake items" on the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

### Initial Promotion and Validation
After building the directory, initial promotion helps validate the idea:
1.  **Reddit**: Search Google for relevant Reddit articles (e.g., "small business ideas Reddit") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. Reply to posts where people ask for ideas or resources, providing the directory's URL. Be cautious not to get banned; make a plan for 1-3 replies per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
2.  **Other Directories**: List the new directory in other relevant directories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. This can drive initial traffic and is a good starting point for marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
3.  [[methods_to_validate_startup_ideas_using_social_media | Social Media]]: Search social media platforms for questions related to the directory's topic and reply with the link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. Social media backlinks, especially from viral posts, can significantly boost Google traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

These initial steps are crucial for validating the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. If there are no clicks or traffic, it indicates a fundamental problem with the idea or domain name, and there's no point in pushing it further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

## Step 3: Iterate and Scale

It's recommended to "never fall in love with the idea for a directory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. Instead, launch multiple directories (e.g., 5-10) simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. After 30 days, analyze the traffic to determine which idea performs best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>. The directory with the most promising initial traffic should receive more dedicated effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

Initially, the focus is on validating potential [[seo_strategies_for_directories | SEO traffic]] and general interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. After this initial validation, the next phase is to focus on the **data quality** within the directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. Experts in a field can quickly discern the quality and curation of a directory's content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>, and high-quality data encourages sharing by influencers, leading to organic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. It's vital to stay updated on the niche and quickly add new, trending items to capture traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

This strategic, iterative approach minimizes risk and maximizes the chances of success in the directory space.

## The Shift in Business Paradigm

The business landscape has undergone a significant transformation due to factors like COVID-19 and the rise of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This has led to key shifts across three areas: Product, Marketing, and Operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Product Development
Traditionally, launching a product required raising venture capital and could take years, often involving hiring expensive software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
> [!info] The New Paradigm: Technical Shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>
> With AI, products can be built instantly, at low cost, and with zero employees, eliminating the need for engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Marketing
Past marketing efforts often required a significant social media budget, a creative team, professional advertising, or an agency, focusing on seasonal big campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
> [!info] The New Paradigm: Audience Shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>
> The rise of "solopreneurs" demonstrates an "always-on marketing" approach, where transparency and storytelling engage audiences daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This approach is even being adopted by large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Operations
Historically, operations involved hiring talent for productivity and often required an office space, leading to lengthy product cycles and high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
> [!info] The New Paradigm: Cultural Shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>
> Remote working eliminates the need for physical office space and allows access to global talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Businesses can build faster with fewer people, operating in a leaner manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Sequential Prompting: A New AI Technique

There are two common ways to use [[using_ai_tools_for_generating_startup_ideas | AI tools]]: conversationally (back-and-forth with ChatGPT) or by creating master prompts (one large prompt for a solid output) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Omar introduces a third technique called **sequential prompting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

Sequential prompting involves using ChatGPT to generate a prompt that will then be used in *another* AI tool to produce a different output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This process can be chained, taking an output from one AI tool and using it as an input for the next, like building with "Lego bricks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

> [!example] Sequential Workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>
> 1.  **ChatGPT**: Generates a prompt (e.g., for an image description).
> 2.  **Leonardo AI**: Uses the prompt from ChatGPT to generate an image.
> 3.  **Cling AI**: Takes the image from Leonardo AI and animates it into a video.
> 4.  **11 Labs**: Adds voiceovers to the animated video.

This entire sequence can be built manually at first for iteration, then automated using tools like Zapier or Make, or by connecting APIs programmatically with an engineer for more complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

> [!note] Old vs. New Workflow for Social Media Content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>
> *   **Old**: Required physical roles like content writer, graphic designer, social media manager, CMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
> *   **New**: A single person can perform the exact same job as five or six people using [[building_a_startup_using_ai_tools | AI tools]] like ChatGPT and Leonardo AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## Building with AI: Creating Consistent Avatars

A key starting point for many [[ai_startup_ideas | AI startup ideas]] is creating and customizing AI avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### The Avatar Creation Process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>
1.  **Start with a prompt structure**: A specific prompt tells ChatGPT how to generate a description of a person based on an image input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
2.  **Upload an image to ChatGPT**: Provide an image reference (e.g., of a child) along with a name, age, and gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. ChatGPT reads the image and provides a detailed description including hairstyle, skin tone, and outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.
3.  **Generate a prompt in ChatGPT**: ChatGPT provides a prompt structure that ensures character consistency, useful for telling a story or narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
4.  **Input the prompt into Leonardo AI**: Copy the generated prompt and paste it into Leonardo.ai to create the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Leonardo AI can generate high-resolution, Disney-Pixar style images in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

> [!example] API Integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>
> Both ChatGPT and Leonardo AI have APIs, allowing for programmatic generation. A user could upload a child's image to a custom interface, which then uses ChatGPT's API to get a prompt, and then Leonardo AI's API to generate the image, all within about 10 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

## Startup Ideas Leveraging AI Avatars and Sequential Prompting

These [[ai_startup_ideas | AI startup ideas]] focus on personalization, storytelling, and content creation, often with minimal overhead.

### Idea 1: AI-First Personalized Greeting Cards (Moonpig 2.0)
Inspired by companies like Moonpig.com (a $400 million/year business in the UK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>, this idea focuses on creating personalized greeting cards or invitations using AI-generated avatars and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

> [!example] Features of an AI-First Moonpig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>

> *   **Monthly Memberships**: $10-$15/month for unlimited cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>.
> *   **Upselling Gifts**: Matching items like flowers or chocolates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.
> *   **Projections**: With 200,000 users purchasing five cards annually at $7 each, plus add-on sales, a total revenue of $10 million is projected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>.

### Idea 2: AI-Powered Storytelling for Kids (Teeny Tales)
Inspired by personalized children's books like "Hurray Heroes," this concept involves creating custom animated stories for children using AI avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
> [!example] Teeny Tales Workflow Concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>
> *   **User Input**: Child's name, date of birth, uploaded image.
> *   **Story Creation**: User selects theme or "magic tale" option for AI to generate a story.
> *   **Customization**: Change cover (generated by Leonardo AI), edit text, play narration (using 11 Labs).
> *   **Sequential Prompting in Background**: Updating the tale triggers the full sequential prompting workflow (ChatGPT, Leonardo, Cling AI, etc.) via APIs, delivering new content to the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.

This model could extend to educational content (B2E or B2S) by creating engaging stories based on school curriculum topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

### Idea 3: Personalized Animated Moments/Memes
[[using_ai_tools_for_generating_startup_projects | Using AI for creating steps in startup projects]] allows for generating personalized animated moments or memes featuring AI avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
> [!example] Scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>
> Imagine creating a storyboard of a funny event (e.g., a stag holiday) based on photos or prompts, and sending it as an animated GIF to a group chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. This leverages the current trend of "memefying moments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

This involves:
1.  **Generating multiple character prompts in ChatGPT**: To create consistent characters in different scenes, even interacting (e.g., a child waving goodbye to a parent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.
2.  **Generating images with Leonardo AI**: Using the character prompts to create images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>.
3.  **Animating with Cling AI**: Uploading images to Cling AI to turn them into short video clips (currently 5-second videos take about 4 minutes to generate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. Cling AI also has a dub feature for lip-syncing spoken words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
4.  **Stitching clips for GIFs**: Combining multiple animated clips to create GIFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. This could be a "premium offering" that might require manual assistance from low-cost labor for now, due to generation time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

### Idea 4: Personalized AI-Generated Stickers
This idea focuses on creating personalized physical stickers using AI-generated avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.
> [!example] Use Case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>
> Teachers could give students personalized "well done" stickers featuring an AI-generated image of themselves or even the teacher interacting with the student (e.g., a high five) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. This could serve as an incentive for kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>.

> [!note] The Sticker Creation Process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>
> 1.  **ChatGPT Prompt**: Tell ChatGPT to create a "kiss-cut sticker artwork" prompt with specific text (e.g., "Congratulations") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.
> 2.  **Leonardo AI**: Use the prompt in Leonardo AI to generate the sticker image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. Ensure "prompt enhance" is off and the aspect ratio is 1:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>.
> 3.  **Remove.BG**: Use Remove.BG (or its API) to automatically remove the background from the generated image, creating a PNG sticker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
> 4.  **Printful Integration**: Connect with a print-on-demand API like Printful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. This allows for automated order fulfillment for stickers, clothing, or other products, possibly connected via Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

> [!example] Gorilla Marketing Technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>
> To acquire customers for a school-focused sticker business, one could find staff directories on school websites, take images of principals or teachers, generate personalized sticker sheets with their AI avatars, print them, and mail them to the schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>. This unique approach could go viral within the school and grab attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>.

The traditional [[effective_funnel_strategies_for_different_business_types | marketing funnel]] is an "entirely wrong way to think about marketing" today, serving as a deceptive simplification of what actually happens in modern marketing [00:00:07]. People don't simply enter at the top and exit at the bottom as a purchase [00:01:12]. Instead, their buying journey involves interacting with a brand, moving away, and then being "sucked back in" for multiple rotations before a conversion [00:01:22].

## Digital Gravity: A New Marketing Paradigm

A proposed alternative to the [[effective_funnel_strategies_for_different_business_types | marketing funnel]] is "digital gravity" [00:00:21]. This concept visualizes how to [[content_and_brand_building_strategies | build brands]] and companies by accumulating "digital mass" on the internet [00:01:31]. The greater a brand's digital mass, the more influence it exerts within its niche [00:02:03]. This mass is primarily built through [[content_and_brand_building_strategies | content]] and marketing everywhere the customer is present [00:02:14].

As a company grows and builds digital mass, more people get "sucked into that orbit" and enter a rotation around the brand [00:03:39]. These rotations eventually lead to "touchdowns," which translate into revenue [00:03:44]. This generates a "growth flywheel" where revenue is reinvested to build even more mass [00:03:49].

> "The bigger you get, the more mass you build... you get more people that get sucked into that orbit of that planet that you're building and they get in rotation and as they get in rotation then you have more touchdowns that occur when they touch down that turns into Revenue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>

### Campaign Thinking vs. Continuous Marketing

Traditional marketing often frames efforts as "campaigns," a term originating from military strategy implying a start and an end [00:05:32]. Modern marketing, however, is a continuous process; companies are constantly marketing, not just executing campaigns [00:06:01]. This requires a mindset shift towards continuously adding mass to the brand's digital presence [00:06:13].

### Resource Allocation for Startups

The approach to building digital mass varies significantly based on a startup's funding:
*   **Funded Startups**: Have ample money, time, and resources, allowing them to market "everywhere" [00:02:45]. This is the purpose of raising money [00:02:54].
*   **Bootstrapped Startups**: Typically have a lot of time and mental energy but limited money [00:02:58].

## B2B Marketing Playbook

For B2B companies, the strategy focuses on making the brand famous within a targeted audience, often around 50,000 people [00:10:00].

### 1. Identify and Target the Audience
*   **Email Scraping**: Collect emails from the target audience using tools like Apollo.io ($99/month for 10,000 emails) or even LinkedIn [00:10:04].
*   **Paid Ads**: Import scraped emails into custom match lists on Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads [00:10:53]. Facebook Ads typically match 30-40% of emails [00:11:03]. These ads should run indefinitely in the background [00:11:16].
*   **Ad Content**:
    *   Utilize [[future_trends_in_aidriven_marketing | UGC AI Avatar ads]] (e.g., HeyGen for avatars, ElevenLabs for voice) [00:11:21].
    *   Create a digital clone of the founder to build their personal brand alongside the company [00:11:31].
    *   Develop 100 variations of ads with different hooks, settings, backgrounds, content, and pain points [00:11:53].
    *   Allocate 80% of the ad budget to the best-performing variants (lowest CPC), with 20% reserved for continuous testing (Alpha Beta campaign structure) [00:12:11].
    *   Ads should focus on problem-solution orientation within a storytelling format, following the Hero Journey cycle [00:14:08]. People buy from people, not just brands [00:13:48].

### 2. Leverage Cold Email
*   **Tools**: Use services like MailReef (for AWS specialized cold email servers, ~50,000 emails for $400/month) and SmartLead or Instantly AI ($89) for sending [00:14:33].
*   **Domain Isolation**: Maintain separate domains for transactional emails (core app domain), newsletter emails (separate domain), and cold emails (multiple variations) to prevent one from compromising the others if flagged [00:15:42].
*   **Content**: Cold emails should also align with the problem-solution orientation of the ads [00:17:13].
*   **Impact**: Even if not immediately converting, cold emails often lead to conversions months later when recipients search their inbox for the solution [00:17:34]. The goal is to land as much email as possible to increase surface area [00:17:54]. Don't fear "burning" the audience, as it's hard to make them care without persistence and value [00:18:05].

### 3. Build a Media Company
*   **Podcasting**: Record customer conversations to understand pain points and turn them into a podcast [00:21:45]. This serves as valuable, educational [[content_and_brand_building_strategies | content]] [00:22:57].
    *   Distribute episodes via email (e.g., MailerLite, Beehiiv, Substack) to the scraped list (e.g., 200 emails/day) with a summary and key takeaways [00:22:04].
    *   **Leverage**: A popular podcast can become a leverage point, allowing negotiation for better deals with partners (e.g., Rupa Health used their podcast to negotiate lab fees) [00:23:11].
    *   **Monetization**: Turn the podcast into a profit center by selling ad placements and newsletter sponsorships (e.g., Athletic Greens partnership subsidized an entire growth team) [00:24:09]. This can lead to "negative CAC" (Customer Acquisition Cost) [00:24:52].
*   **Content Repurposing**:
    *   Use [[future_trends_in_aidriven_marketing | AI-driven marketing]] tools like Swell AI to extract pain points, create transcripts, blog posts, white papers, and generate short-form video clips [00:27:52].
    *   Schedule these assets across all customer-present platforms (LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.) [00:28:40].
    *   Short-form content (like TikToks or Instagram Reels) can go viral on LinkedIn [00:28:57].
*   **Social Media Growth**: Run "Instagram-only ads" with a call to action in the caption to "follow this account for more content like this" [00:29:22]. Aim for impressions; a percentage of users will follow the profile, leading to free impressions later [00:29:37].

### B2B Success Examples:
*   **Rupa Health**: Grew Instagram to 100,000 followers and achieved a multi-hundred-million-dollar exit using these playbooks [00:01:43, 00:30:13]. Their podcast gained 180,000 downloads/month within 6 months, becoming a top 20 medical podcast [00:23:28].
*   **Aero Electronics**: A $6 billion market cap company that owns virtually every electronics blog and magazine, functioning as a media company reselling components [00:26:16].
*   **Red Bull & Y Combinator**: Both are essentially media companies that sell other products (energy drinks, venture capital) [00:26:47]. YC's heavy investment in YouTube content showcases this strategy [00:27:05].

### The Power of Owned Media
Building a media arm creates "mental real estate" in the customer's mind [00:36:44]. When a brand occupies this space, it becomes incredibly difficult for competitors to dislodge them [00:36:53]. This strategy can lead to significant inbound leads and high-value deals [00:35:43].

## Consumer (B2C) Marketing Approaches

Consumer marketing is significantly more competitive and requires exceptional marketing skills [00:39:01].

### 1. Product & Market Fundamentals
*   **Huge Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: Essential for consumer success, as content must be broad enough to target a large subset of the population [00:39:57].
*   **Application-First**: Build an app that solves a single problem exceptionally well for a large audience [00:41:07].
*   **Pricing**: A price point like $7.99/week (translating to ~ $29/month) can be an impulse purchase, providing ~3 months of revenue per customer [00:41:34].
*   **Ebooks**: [[future_trends_in_aidriven_marketing | AI-driven marketing]] can be used to create ebooks (e.g., with Gam for publishing) [00:40:39].

### 2. Paid Advertising and [[Content_and_Brand_Building_Strategies | Content]] Generation
*   **Primary Platforms**: Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads, and Google are key [00:42:04].
*   **Conversion Events**: Optimize for deep links for app installs, signups, or paid actions within the app [00:42:09].
*   **UGC Creators**: Hire 5-10 UGC creators (around $1,000/month for a video a day) to generate diverse content [00:42:41]. These creators serve as a test bed for content likely to go viral [00:42:55]. Ads should feel like engaging [[content_and_brand_building_strategies | content]] rather than direct advertisements [00:43:15].
*   **[[trends_in_tiktok_marketing_borrowed_from_the_ecommerce_sector | TikTok Marketing]]**:
    *   Spin up 10 different TikTok accounts [00:43:42].
    *   Remix best-performing UGC content using [[future_trends_in_aidriven_marketing | AI-driven marketing]] tools (ChatGPT for scripts, HeyGen for video, ElevenLabs for audio, CapCut for editing) [00:43:55].
    *   These short videos serve as top-of-funnel touches [00:44:23].
*   **Unique Naming**: Choose a product name that avoids competition on the first page of Google search results [00:44:29].
*   **Pixeling & Remarketing**: Install Facebook, TikTok, and Google pixels on the website [00:44:43]. This allows for indefinite remarketing to anyone who visits the site, creating a growing audience for future ads [00:45:01].
*   **Email Nurture**: Capture emails on the website to layer on an email nurture sequence that upsells the product [00:45:52].

### 3. Influencer & Affiliate Strategies
*   **Influencer Outreach at Scale**: Scrape emails of creators in your niche from YouTube bios or Instagram hashtags (e.g., using IGleads.io) [00:46:03, 00:48:46].
*   **Cold Outreach**: Contact these creators to inquire about their pricing [00:46:59].
*   **Arbitrage**: Identify discrepancies in pricing (an "imperfect market") to find creators who offer high average views at a lower cost [00:47:20].
*   **Deal Structure**: Typically, a three-video package (e.g., $1,500) combined with a 30% recurring affiliate commission for brought-in revenue works well [00:47:38]. This creates "stickiness" and a moat against competitors who might try to clone the product [00:48:11].
*   **CPM Advantage**: Paying creators directly often results in a significantly lower CPM (e.g., $5 CPM vs. $10 average on TikTok), highlighting the arbitrage opportunity [00:49:33].

### 4. Programmatic SEO
*   **Strategy**: For apps with growing domain authority (trust from Google due to backlinks), implement programmatic SEO to rank for thousands of longtail, low-difficulty keywords [00:50:11].
*   **Process**:
    *   Scrape top-ranking content for target keywords [00:51:29].
    *   Use [[future_trends_in_aidriven_marketing | AI-driven marketing]] tools (e.g., ChatGPT) to generate blog post outlines and write content section by section [00:51:38]. This approach ensures quality and passes AI humanizer checks [00:51:51].
    *   Publish large volumes of articles (e.g., 10,000) [00:52:20].
    *   Once a page gets traffic, a human SEO specialist or content writer refines it to ensure it ranks well with Google and resonates with human readers [00:52:48].
*   **Website CTAs**: Include a call to action to sign up for the app after the first paragraph, ensure a call-out is visible in every scroll frame, and implement a full-screen pop-up at 25-50% scroll rate [00:53:24]. These actions also pixel visitors for remarketing [00:54:01].

### Consumer Success Examples:
*   **Women's Health App**: Achieved ebook downloads at 40 cents by targeting a broad audience where 1 in 3 women shared a specific problem [00:40:13].
*   **Cal AI & Riz GPT**: These apps achieve $1M/month in MRR by paying around $5 CPM for user acquisition, which is 50% cheaper than TikTok's average CPM [00:49:15].
*   **Sunflower Sober App**: Demonstrated insane growth trajectory by building an AI sponsor into the app, leading to unbelievable engagement and acquisition primarily through Facebook ads [00:54:21].

The core of effective marketing, whether B2B or B2C, lies in consistent, pervasive efforts that build digital mass and influence over time, leveraging [[content_and_brand_building_strategies | content]] and strategic distribution across various channels.

Sequential prompting is a technique for leveraging multiple AI tools in a chained workflow to achieve complex outputs, often without needing to hire a large team [03:37]. This method goes beyond simple conversational AI or single "master prompts" by using the output of one AI model as the input or prompt for the next [10:37].

## The Evolution of Business and AI

Traditional business models for tech products often required significant venture capital, years to launch, and hiring numerous software engineers [05:07]. Marketing involved large social media budgets, creative teams, and seasonal campaigns [05:31]. Operations relied heavily on physical talent in offices, leading to long product cycles and high costs [05:50].

However, recent shifts due to events like COVID-19 and the rise of AI have transformed these paradigms:
*   **Product:** [[operator_ai_capabilities_and_limitations | AI]] allows for instant product building at low cost with zero employees [06:44].
*   **Marketing:** A shift towards "always-on marketing" driven by transparency and storytelling, where even solo entrepreneurs can gain mainstream attention by sharing their journey and revenue [08:46].
*   **Operations:** A cultural shift towards remote work and leaner teams, enabling faster building with fewer people [09:34].

## Understanding Sequential Prompting

While traditional [[effective_ad_prompting_techniques_with_chatgpt | AI prompting techniques]] include conversational (back-and-forth with ChatGPT) and master prompts (one large prompt for a solid output), sequential prompting introduces a third layer [10:13].

Sequential prompting involves using ChatGPT to generate a prompt that is then fed into a *different* AI tool for a specific output [11:17]. This output can then be further processed by another AI tool, creating a "Lego brick" like sequence [12:07]. The entire process can be manually performed for iterative refinement and then automated programmatically via APIs or tools like Zapier/Make for a seamless user experience [12:44].

## Workflow Example: Creating an AI Avatar and Story

This process demonstrates how to create and animate a consistent AI avatar through a multi-step sequential prompt:

1.  **Initial Prompt Generation (ChatGPT):**
    *   Start with a specific prompt structure provided to ChatGPT, along with an image reference (e.g., a photo of a child) [14:36].
    *   Instruct ChatGPT to generate a detailed description of the character (name, age, gender, hairstyle, skin tone, accessories, outfit) from the image [19:35]. This description acts as a consistent character profile for future use [19:54].
    *   The output from ChatGPT is a new prompt specifically designed for an image generation AI [19:19].
    > [!TIP]
    > While ChatGPT can describe images, it may not perfectly render text within images [45:50]. Always review and refine the output, potentially feeding the generated image back to ChatGPT for further refinement of the prompt [56:26].

2.  **Image Generation (Leonardo AI):**
    *   Take the detailed prompt generated by ChatGPT and input it into [[exploring_aigenerated_art_beyond_text_prompting | Leonardo AI]] [20:07].
    *   Adjust settings like aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9 for widescreen) and disable "prompt enhance" to maintain fidelity to the original prompt [20:41].
    *   Leonardo AI then generates high-resolution, Pixar/Disney-style images based on the character description [20:49]. This process is incredibly fast, taking only a few seconds [22:15].
    *   Leonardo AI offers an API, allowing for programmatic image generation [20:59].

3.  **Video Animation (Cling AI):**
    *   Upload the static image generated by Leonardo AI to Cling AI [43:40].
    *   Cling AI transforms the image into a short video clip [49:59].
    *   Additional prompts can be added to direct character actions within the scene (e.g., "sip the cup") [48:43].
    *   Cling AI also features a dub function to lip-sync characters to spoken words [50:30].
    *   While effective, video generation can currently take several minutes for a 5-second clip, suggesting a need for human assistance for high-volume orders in the current stage [51:06]. Cling AI also has an API for programmatic use [34:34].

4.  **Background Removal (Remove.bg):**
    *   For applications like stickers, the generated image can be sent to a tool like Remove.bg to automatically remove the background, creating a clean PNG file [59:27].
    *   Remove.bg also has an API for automated background removal [01:00:26].

5.  **Physical Product Fulfillment (Printful):**
    *   The AI-generated digital assets (like the PNG sticker) can be integrated with print-on-demand services like Printful via their API [01:01:01].
    *   This allows for the automated fulfillment of physical products such as stickers, clothing, or t-shirts directly from the AI-generated designs [01:01:14].

## Business Opportunities with AI Avatars and Sequential Prompting

This workflow opens up numerous entrepreneurial opportunities, particularly for solo entrepreneurs or lean startups, as it significantly reduces the need for large teams and high upfront costs [03:13].

*   **AI-First Personalized Greeting Cards/Gifts:** Inspired by companies like Moonpig ($400M annual revenue) [28:54], an AI-first version could offer dynamically generated cards or gifts featuring personalized AI avatars and stories.
    *   Features could include: dynamic character and scene creation, AI-generated mini-stories, AI-enhanced templates, and video/voiceover integration [32:32].
    *   Revenue streams: premium card sales (with AI-driven markup), monthly memberships, and upsell of matched gift items [33:04].
    *   This approach focuses on storytelling through animation in a Pixar/Disney style, which resonates universally [24:14].

*   **Personalized Children's Storybooks (Teeny Tales):**
    *   Create custom storybooks where children and even their parents are characters in AI-generated narratives [36:38].
    *   Users upload an image, select themes, and AI generates the story, images, and even suggests covers [37:00].
    *   This builds on existing concepts like "Hurray Heroes" but significantly reduces overheads by using AI instead of human illustrators [27:40].
    *   Potential for B2E (Business-to-Education) model, creating educational systems and engaging learning materials based on specific curricula [41:55].

*   **Memifying Moments and Social Content:**
    *   Quickly generate AI-style images or GIFs of trending moments or personal events for social media or group chats [28:02].
    *   This leverages the "always-on marketing" and transparent storytelling approach [08:46].

*   **Personalized Stickers and Print-on-Demand:**
    *   Create custom stickers featuring AI-generated avatars of individuals (e.g., teachers, students) for incentives, rewards, or personal use [53:15].
    *   The workflow involves generating the character, adding text (e.g., "Congratulations"), removing the background, and sending it to a print-on-demand service [54:50].
    *   This can be scaled into a business targeting schools or individuals, potentially even using "guerrilla marketing" tactics like sending personalized stickers to school principals [57:17].

By combining these AI tools and processes, entrepreneurs can build complex, automated, and revenue-generating products with a lean team, focusing on creating unique user experiences around powerful AI models [38:50].

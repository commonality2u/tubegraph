Sequential prompting is a technique for utilizing AI tools in a multi-step workflow to achieve complex outputs, often involving different AI models working in conjunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This method contrasts with conversational AI or single "master prompts" by chaining together various AI outputs and using one AI's output as the input or prompt for the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## How Sequential Prompting Works

The core idea behind sequential prompting is to use one AI, such as [[Prompting techniques for AIgenerated content | Chat GPT]], to generate a prompt or specific instructions for another AI tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This process can be extended through multiple "layers" or "Lego bricks," where the output of one AI becomes the input for the next, creating a comprehensive and customized product or experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Key steps include:
1.  **Initial Prompt Generation**: Using a tool like [[Prompting techniques for AIgenerated content | Chat GPT]] to analyze input (e.g., an image) and generate a detailed prompt description for another AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
2.  **Intermediate Output**: Feeding the generated prompt into a specialized AI tool (e.g., [[Using AI tools for design | Leonardo AI]] for image generation) to create an initial output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
3.  **Further Processing**: Taking that output and using it as input for another AI tool for further refinement or transformation (e.g., animating an image with [[Using AI tools for design | Cling AI]] or adding voiceovers with Eleven Labs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
4.  **User Interface Integration**: Connecting these sequential AI processes with a user-friendly front-end experience, allowing users to interact with and customize the outputs without needing to understand the underlying AI prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>.

Initially, it's recommended to perform this process manually to iterate and refine the prompts and workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. Once satisfied with the results, the workflow can be automated using tools like Zapier or Make, or by developing custom API integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## AI Tools Used in Sequential Prompting

Several AI tools are commonly used in a sequential prompting workflow:
*   **[[Prompting techniques for AIgenerated content | Chat GPT]] / Claude AI**: Used for generating descriptive prompts, story narratives, and even business plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. It can analyze images to create character descriptions for consistent imagery across different scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.
*   **[[Using AI tools for design | Leonardo AI]]**: An image generation tool that takes detailed prompts to create high-quality, consistent images, such as Disney-style characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

*   **Printful**: A print-on-demand service with an API that allows for automated fulfillment of physical products (e.g., stickers, clothing) using AI-generated designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

## Business Applications and Opportunities

Sequential prompting enables the creation of new products and services with low overhead and often zero employees, allowing for rapid prototyping and market entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

### AI-First Personalized Products

A significant opportunity lies in creating AI-first versions of existing businesses, such as personalized greeting cards. For example, a business similar to Moonpig (a company generating $400 million in revenue annually) could be revolutionized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

Using sequential prompting, an AI-first Moonpig could offer:
*   **Dynamic Character and Scene Creation**: Users upload photos, and AI generates consistent characters in various scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **AI-Generated Stories**: Turning every card into a mini-story with custom characters and narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
*   **Voiceover and Video Integration**: Adding generated voiceovers or short animated videos to enhance personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>.

This approach justifies a premium price point, allowing for recurring revenue through subscriptions and upsells of related gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

### Custom Storybooks for Children (Teeny Tales)

Similar to custom greeting cards, personalized children's books can be created. By taking a child's photo and using [[Prompting techniques for AIgenerated content | Chat GPT]] to maintain character consistency, [[Using AI tools for design | Leonardo AI]] can generate illustrations for an entire story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. These images can then be animated with [[Using AI tools for design | Cling AI]] and narrated to create engaging digital or physical storybooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

This concept can also extend to [[Business applications of AI prompting | educational content]], where curriculum topics are transformed into engaging, personalized stories and visuals for students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

### Personalized Stickers and Merchandise

Sequential prompting allows for the creation of customized physical products like stickers. Users can upload an image, which [[Prompting techniques for AIgenerated content | Chat GPT]] uses to generate a "kiss cut sticker" prompt. [[Using AI tools for design | Leonardo AI]] then creates the sticker artwork, Remove.bg removes the background, and Printful's API can automate the printing and shipping process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. This model can be expanded to other merchandise like t-shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.

This approach offers significant value for markets like schools, where teachers could use personalized stickers of themselves or students as incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.

### Memes and Viral Content

The ability to generate consistent characters and scenes quickly also opens avenues for creating trending memes and viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. Businesses can create "always-on marketing" by rapidly producing content that reacts to current events or personal moments, fostering audience engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

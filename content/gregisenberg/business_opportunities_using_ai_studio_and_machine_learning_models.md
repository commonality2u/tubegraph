## Introducing AI Studio and Gemini Models

AI Studio is a platform designed to showcase the full capabilities of Google's Gemini models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. It is free to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, allowing users to explore and identify differentiated features for their own applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

The core of AI Studio's power lies in the Gemini models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Various models are available, each with different trade-offs:
*   **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: A more powerful, though slightly more expensive, model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Flashlight**: Offers higher rate limits and is less intelligent but can perform many core tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Pro Model**: An experimental variant and currently the most intelligent model available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Reasoning Model**: This model excels at "thinking" through complex problems before generating an output, which is where new frontier capabilities are emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. It's available for free for developers in AI Studio and via API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Key Capabilities and Business Opportunities

### 1. Long Context Processing
One of AI Studio's significant capabilities is its "long context" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, which allows models to process extensive amounts of information. For example, it can analyze a 30-minute video (like a museum tour) and extract detailed information, such as a list of all museum exhibits, from 531,000 tokens of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This capability also extends to long audio files, like podcasts, allowing for the extraction of significant intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

**Business Opportunities**:

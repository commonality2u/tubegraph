The discussion includes how these tools can be used for [[utilizing_ai_for_startup_idea_generation | utilizing AI for startup idea generation]] and [[developing_and_testing_startup_ideas_using_ai_tools | developing and testing startup ideas using AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Introduction to AI Product Designers

AI product designers are tools that allow users to generate designs and front-end code by simply writing English prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. They aim to help non-designers create production-ready designs with the assistance of artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Poly

Poly is an AI product designer that gained attention as a Y Combinator startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It claims to produce "beautiful designs" and "production-ready code" from text prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Features of Poly

*   **Prompt-based design**: Users can write what they want to build, similar to a conversational AI like ChatGPT but for design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Voice input**: It supports recording voice to input design requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Image upload**: Users can upload images, including hand-drawn wireframes, to guide the design process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This feature allows Poly to create interfaces similar to a provided image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Design customization**: Options to edit elements like font, radius, and colors after generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Credit system**: Poly operates on a credit system, where actions like generating pages or components consume credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Design history**: Maintains a history of generated designs, allowing users to revisit previous versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
*   **Code output**: Poly is designed to connect seamlessly with Figma and existing codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### Evaluation of Poly

During a live test, Poly demonstrated its ability to create a landing page and elements of a product design based on a user's idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

*   **Initial Output**: The first attempt generated a landing page for "to predict," an AI-powered analytics tool for YouTube content. While the copy was decent, the design wasn't "glassy" as requested, and clickable elements were non-functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. It failed to create actual product images for the landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Prompting Refinement**: A second prompt using the specific design term "glass morphism" yielded a more visually appealing and somewhat glassy design, though still not fully meeting the expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. The product images, however, were still irrelevant dashboard elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
*   **Product Design Improvement**: After a third prompt, Poly generated a more in-depth product interface with elements like "Version A" comparisons, engagement charts, and AI suggestions, though it still misunderstood some YouTube-specific elements like "image video format" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.
*   **Pros**:
    *   Generates a functional landing page and internal product views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.
    *   Produces production-ready code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
    *   Includes interactive elements in the final design (e.g., hover functionality on charts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   **Cons**:
    *   Lacks a progress bar during generation, making the waiting process feel long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
    *   Does not offer interactive feedback or ask clarifying questions, acting as a "black box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
    *   Struggles with understanding specific product context (e.g., YouTube analytics vs. general website analytics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
    *   Initially delivered a landing page instead of the product design requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

## Vercel's V0

Vercel's V0 is another prominent AI product designer in the space, known for its ability to generate designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Features of V0

*   **Transparent generation process**: V0 provides reasoning for its design choices, making the process less of a "black box" compared to Poly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Interactive feedback**: Users can ask questions and get direct responses from V0 regarding its design implementation, allowing for iterative refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.
*   **Design based on image input**: Similar to Poly, V0 can take an image as inspiration for its designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.

### Evaluation of V0

V0 was tested with the same YouTube analytics startup idea as Poly.

*   **Output**: V0 generated a product interface that literally copied the provided image but built out functional elements for predicting YouTube video performance, including AB testing of titles and thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
*   **Pros**:
    *   Provides clear reasoning and communication during the generation process, which makes it feel more collaborative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
    *   Offers direct feedback on design characteristics (e.g., confirming "glass morphism" and suggesting improvements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.
    *   Visual design appears slightly nicer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.
*   **Cons**:
    *   Literally copied the input image, which can be limiting if unique designs are desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
    *   Missing some interactive features seen in Poly's output, such as hover-over chart details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

## Startup Idea: YouTube Analytics and Prediction Tool

A multi-million dollar startup idea discussed during the demonstration is an AI-powered SaaS product for YouTubers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

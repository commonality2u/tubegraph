The search volume for "[[AI Tools for Small Businesses | AI]] for e-commerce newsletters" is currently experiencing significant growth [00:11:00, 00:11:07]. This trend indicates a rising demand for solutions in this niche.

## The Problem

A primary reason for this increasing search volume is that e-commerce businesses often struggle with what content to include in their newsletters and how to effectively communicate about their products [00:11:13]. Additionally, there's a need for assistance in designing these email newsletters [00:11:22].

Many e-commerce companies still hardcode their emails, a process that is time-consuming and prone to errors due to complex coding structures like "tables within tables" [00:11:47, 00:11:59]. Businesses also pay for email marketing platforms like Clavio but may not be "extracting all the value out of it" [00:15:17]. They know they need to do email marketing but lack ideas for unique content, often repeating the same product discussions [00:15:30, 00:15:40].

## Business Model Based on Underserved Software

A broader framework for building businesses in this space involves identifying "underserved software" that has a high Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) [00:16:19, 00:16:44]. Examples include Clavio (estimated LTV ~$25,000 over 24 months) and HubSpot (estimated LTV $25,000-$50,000) [00:16:29, 00:16:35].

The strategy involves:
1.  **Finding Underserved Software:** Use [[AI Tools for Small Businesses | AI]] tools like ChatGPT to identify high LTV SaaS companies with market caps over a billion dollars [00:16:42].
2.  **Building an Agency:** Establish a productized agency that helps users maximize the value from these core software products [00:17:09]. For example, a "Sage consulting company" for construction firms that use Sage 100/300 [00:17:56].
3.  **Creating Digital Assets:** Develop and sell high-margin (90%+) digital assets and templates [00:18:55].
4.  **Developing Plugins/Custom Builds:** Create plugins or custom solutions on top of the existing software's API, especially for common client requests [00:19:05].

These solutions increase the core product's usage and "stickiness," making the service valuable to the original software company [00:19:41, 00:19:51]. This approach can lead to eventual acquisition by the larger software company [00:19:26].

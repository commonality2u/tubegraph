From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

"Sweaty startups," also known as "boring businesses," are service-based companies that often involve physical labor or traditional industries. Despite their unglamorous nature, many wealthy individuals have built their fortunes through these ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. These businesses are often overlooked by entrepreneurs who are focused on high-tech or venture-backed [[AI startup ideas and incubation | AI startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Characteristics of Sweaty Startups
Sweaty startups typically involve providing essential services and often require direct engagement in the work. They are characterized by:
*   **Tangible Services**: Cleaning, moving, repairing, or other manual labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping Potential**: Many can be started with minimal capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   **Local Focus**: Often serve a specific geographic area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   **Lower Competition**: Face less competition from venture-funded tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>, making them a more predictable path to wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

The idea is to increase the odds of getting "really rich" by doing something "normal" and "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Nick Huber's Journey: Storage Squad
Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," shared his personal [[multimillion_dollar_startup_idea | multimillion dollar startup idea]] journey as an example:
*   **Pickup and Delivery Storage (Storage Squad)**: Started by storing students' boxes over the summer in a warehouse and returning them when school resumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Growth and Profitability**: The business reached $2.2 million in annual revenue, making $400k-$500k profit per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: Primarily used sidewalk chalk ads in high-traffic student areas, writing the ad over 5,000 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Paid ads were not used until the company exceeded $2 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping**: Purchased a cargo van for $1,500 and a box truck for $2,200 to start the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Origin**: The idea came from a Craigslist ad where a potential tenant wanted to store items in Huber's apartment instead of leasing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The business was profitable from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Exit**: Sold the business in 2020 for $1.75 million with no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Self-Storage Facilities
Leveraging the experience from Storage Squad, Huber invested in self-storage facilities:
*   **Erie, Pennsylvania Acquisition**: Bought a 40,000+ sq ft facility with 180+ units for $625,000 at a public auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It was neglected, making only $4,000 a month in revenue, with over 100 abandoned units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **North Georgia Acquisition**: Purchased another facility for $1.5 million that was generating $15,600-$16,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Without "anything spectacular" or raising outside money, the facility now generates $40,000 per month and is valued at $4.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Marketing Strategies for Sweaty Startups
Sweaty startups often employ simple, effective, and low-cost marketing:
*   **Sidewalk Chalk**: Used by Storage Squad to reach students directly on campus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Bandit Signs**: Huber's brother uses these signs for his lawn care company, gaining 30-40 new customers in April/May each year and making over $100,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Word-of-Mouth/Referrals**: A mobile detailing business made $17,000 in revenue and $10,000 profit in a month, largely through reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Sweaty Digital Business Ideas
The principles of sweaty startups can also be applied to digital ventures:
*   **Nanny/Night Nurse Recruiting**: A "sweaty digital business" that addresses a clear demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, potentially charging $3,000-$5,000 per placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **NightNurses.com**: An idea for a specialized directory for night nurses, with potential for expansion into related services like home outfitting for babies, payroll services, and affiliate marketing for products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. The domain was available for $13,000, with a lease-to-own option of $1,100 per month for 13 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
    *   **Marketing for Digital Services**: Could involve local tactics like handing out flyers or using sidewalk chalk in areas frequented by expecting mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
    *   **Domain Value**: Investing in a strong `.com` domain is seen as digital real estate and a significant investment that can quickly pay for itself through increased leads and visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

## Sweaty vs. Tech/AI Startups
While there's a "golden renaissance" of [[trends_and_antitrends_in_startups | AI startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>, the competitive landscape for these businesses is extremely challenging:
*   **High Failure Rate for AI Startups**: An estimated 93% of AI startups may not reach profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. Some argue it could be as high as 99% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
*   **Intense Competition**: Competing against brilliant individuals with significant venture capital funding and vast networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
*   **Easier Competition in Sweaty Businesses**: Many traditional businesses are run by less technologically savvy owners who may not answer calls or manage rates effectively, presenting clear opportunities for those willing to embrace the "boring" work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **AI as a Tool**: AI is seen as a tool that can make traditional business owners more money and reduce labor, rather than making the businesses obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

"The best [[AI startup ideas and market opportunities | AI startups]] are actually going to start as sweaty startups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. This means building a traditional service business first to gain market share and customer relationships, then leveraging technology like AI to enhance operations or offer new services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.

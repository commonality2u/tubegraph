When launching a product, particularly a digital one like a course or an ebook, starting simple is crucial for gathering ideas, building an audience, receiving feedback, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A course or a book is considered the easiest way to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Pricing Digital Products

### Initial Pricing Strategy
For digital products, it's generally advised to start with a paywall rather than offering free access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Pricing the product too cheaply can lead to customers undervaluing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. To maintain motivation and cover costs, it's necessary to price a little higher than initially expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Researching competitor prices can help determine an appropriate starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

[[pricing_models_for_subscriptionbased_apps | Pricing models for subscription-based apps]] can be complex, but for initial products like courses, a one-time payment is often recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

> [!TIP] Using AI for Pricing
> Gather data on competitor pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Use AI tools like Claude as a "pricing partner" to refine your first price by providing the data and asking for recommendations based on an expert persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

Pricing is not static; it can always be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

### Subscription Models
Many business owners are drawn to subscription models due to the promise of monthly recurring revenue (MRR), expecting consistent income over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. However, from a customer's perspective, managing multiple subscriptions (e.g., Netflix, Spotify) can be a "pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Customer Objections
> When a customer sees a subscription, they may immediately think about the hassle of cancelling or forgetting to cancel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. Creating such objections at the point of purchase can negatively impact conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

A key principle for subscriptions is: if you have a recurring payment, you should provide recurring value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. This model typically suits software for businesses, such as a scheduling tool used weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

Many products can benefit from removing subscription models entirely in favor of one-time payments or credit systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. These alternatives can reduce customer commitment and make products easier to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

### Examples of Pricing Approaches
*   **Stripe's Fee Model:** Stripe operates on a pay-per-usage model, charging various percentages for transactions (e.g., 3% for cards, additional 1% for non-European cards, another 1% for different currencies, and 0.4% for invoices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. While smart for the business, these fees can accumulate to a significant expense for users, such as $5,000 a month for one business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.
*   **Sliding Scale Pricing (Proposed):** An alternative to a fixed percentage fee could be a sliding scale where the percentage decreases as revenue increases (e.g., 3% up to $100,000 in sales, 2% from $100,000 to $1 million, and 1% for over $1 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.
*   **Tiered Pricing Over Time (Proposed):** One innovative pricing strategy involved charging a higher fee for the first month or two, which then decreased after a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. This model encourages customers not to cancel, as they would lose the "gained" lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

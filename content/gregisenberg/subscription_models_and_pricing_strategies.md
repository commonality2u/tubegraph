When starting a business, particularly for digital products, choosing the right [[pricing_models_and_revenue_strategies_for_ai_apps | pricing model]] is crucial. While a common perception exists that charging a subscription automatically leads to monthly recurring revenue, this approach requires careful consideration of the value offered to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Subscription vs. One-Time Payment

A key principle for recurring payments is the need to provide recurring value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This model is typically suitable for software used regularly for business, such as scheduling tools for weekly calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. However, for many products, removing the subscription model entirely and opting for a one-time payment or a credit system can be more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

From a customer's perspective, subscriptions can be a "pain" due to managing multiple services like Netflix and Spotify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. The thought of having to cancel or forgetting a subscription can create objections at the point of purchase, negatively impacting conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

For initial products like courses or e-books, a one-time payment is often recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

### Pay-Per-Usage and Other Models

The "pay-per-usage" model, where customers pay more as they use a service more, is exemplified by Stripe's fee structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. While smart for the business, it can be expensive for customers as usage grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. An alternative could be a sliding scale fee where the percentage decreases as volume increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

Another innovative [[pricing_and_monetization_strategies_for_ai_businesses | pricing strategy]] observed years ago involved charging a higher initial subscription fee for the first month, which then decreased after two to three months. This discourages cancellation as customers lose the "gained" value from their longer subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

## Setting Your Price

For digital products, it's advised to start with a paywall rather than launching free products, as selling teaches valuable lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

*   **Avoid pricing too cheaply:** Undervaluing the product can lead to low motivation if sales don't cover basic expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. Pricing a little higher than expected can provide the necessary motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   **Research competitors:** Look at how competitors price similar products to guide your strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   **Utilize AI for pricing:** AI tools like Claude can act as a "[[pricing_and_monetization_strategies_for_ai_businesses | pricing partner]]" to refine your initial price by analyzing competitor data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
*   **Prices can change:** It's possible to adjust your price over time, experimenting with different models like removing free trials or adjusting subscription costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

## Gamification and Monetization

Gamification can be a powerful [[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | monetization strategy]], helping people achieve goals by making habits more engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

*   **Sleep apps:** For example, a sleep app could gamify sleep by allowing users to score points, compete with friends, or even lose money for poor sleep tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. Products like Eight Sleep gamify sleep with a "sleep fitness score" and tracking of REM and deep sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.
*   **Pokemon Sleep:** This app made $100 million from 9.8 million downloads by gamifying sleep: the better a user sleeps, the more their Pok√©mon grow and evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. The combination of nostalgia for a brand (Pokemon) with a real-life goal (better sleep) is a significant factor in its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.
*   **Licensing IP:** A strategy to replicate the success of Pokemon Sleep is to license intellectual property from existing brands and apply it to gamified apps that help people achieve common goals like better sleep or fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. Licensing can be surprisingly affordable for nostalgic IPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
*   **Other Gamified Examples:**
    *   Sweatcoin gamified walking by rewarding steps with a digital coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
    *   Credit card points gamify spending by rewarding usage with points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.
    *   An idea for developers involves gamifying GitHub commits, where more commits earn points that can be redeemed for rewards, coupled with a leaderboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

## Starting Simple to Gain Ideas

Beginning with a simple product like a course or a book is an effective way to generate more ideas, build a small audience, and gather feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's about starting a journey where many ideas will emerge, rather than believing one initial idea will change everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

For instance, a PDF on "how to sleep better," based on personal experience, could be created in a day and sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This simple start can lead to further ventures like a sleep supplement or eye mask business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

**Steps to launch a simple digital product:**
1.  **Choose a medium:** Share what you're working on using platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram (if comfortable on camera), or Twitter (for writers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
2.  **Create content from daily life:** Share your ideas and learning journey, focusing on "I did that" instead of "you should do that," especially when starting out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
3.  **Find your format:** Experiment with different ways of presenting your ideas. This involves consuming content from creators you admire and adopting elements you like into your own style, mixing them to form a unique identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
4.  **Create a simple landing page:** A "tweet-size or tweet-bite" landing page with a call to action helps to avoid overthinking and quickly launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Tools like gamma.app can help create beautiful lead magnets easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
5.  **Launch everywhere:** Distribute your product widely to learn about what resonates with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

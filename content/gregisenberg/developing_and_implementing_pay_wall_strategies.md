Successful [[pricing_strategies_and_subscription_models | paywall strategies]] are crucial for monetizing mobile applications, particularly AI-driven ones. This involves not only selecting the right tools but also adopting a specific philosophy for user acquisition and market dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>.

## Recommended Tools

For managing and optimizing paywalls, Superwall is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>. It simplifies split testing and provides all necessary data, making it a preferred choice over alternatives like RevenueCat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>.

## Optimization Philosophy

While many in the industry optimize for "number of users multiplied by profit per user," an alternative approach is to optimize for "number of users raised to the N, where N is greater than one, multiplied by profit per user" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>.

This means accepting a potentially lower Lifetime Value (LTV) per download in exchange for more people using the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:09:00">[25:09:00]</a>. The primary benefit of this strategy is to quickly dominate the market and increase word-of-mouth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>. This focus on maximizing user base can be challenging to measure when constantly running ads, as it's hard to distinguish organic growth from paid acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:00">[25:56:00]</a>.

## Paywall Implementation

The most standard industry practice for paywalls is to guide users through an onboarding flow before presenting the paywall at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:34:00">[26:34:00]</a>. This often involves asking for push notifications or personal information to customize the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:00">[26:54:00]</a>.

While this method is efficient for conversion, as users have already invested time and become excited after seeing a TikTok or Reel about the app, it can raise ethical considerations due to the feeling of being "hit" with a paywall after engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:16:00">[27:16:00]</a>.

> "I don't think that it's morally great, I don't like feel good about it but... it is efficient practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>.

The belief is that increasing market efficiency and accelerating a product's reach to its inevitable end state justifies this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>.

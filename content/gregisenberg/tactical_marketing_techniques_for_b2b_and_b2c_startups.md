Traditional marketing funnels are considered an entirely wrong and deceptive way to think about modern marketing, as they don't reflect how people actually buy products [00:00:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Instead of a linear process where customers enter at the top and exit at the bottom, purchasing decisions are often iterative, involving multiple interactions with a brand over time [00:01:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. People interact with a brand, disengage, get "sucked back in," rotate around it multiple times, and then finally make a purchase [00:01:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This extended journey, which can span years for significant purchasing decisions, highlights the need for continuous engagement rather than isolated "campaigns" [00:04:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, [00:05:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Digital Gravity: A New Marketing Paradigm

A proposed alternative framework is "Digital Gravity" [00:00:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This concept suggests that building a brand or company involves accumulating "digital mass" on the internet [00:02:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The more digital mass a company has, the more influence it exerts within its niche [00:02:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This mass is primarily built through widespread content creation and marketing efforts across all platforms where customers are present [00:02:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

As a company (or "planet") builds more mass, it attracts more "customers" (or "comets") into its orbit, leading to more "touchdowns" (revenue) [00:03:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This creates a growth flywheel: revenue is reinvested to build more mass, further increasing influence and attracting more customers [00:03:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This approach is applicable to [[marketing_for_local_service_businesses | local service businesses]], [[b2b_versus_b2c_startups | B2B]], and [[b2b_versus_b2c_startups | B2C]] companies [00:03:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Resource Allocation for Startups

The approach to building digital mass differs based on a startup's funding:
*   **Funded Startups:** Have significant money, time, and resources. They should aim to be "everywhere" their customers are [00:02:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapped Startups:** Often have ample time and mental energy but limited money. They need to prioritize their marketing efforts [00:02:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Tactical Marketing for B2B

[[b2b_versus_b2c_startups | B2B]] marketing often targets a smaller audience, sometimes around 50,000 people [00:10:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The goal is to make the company famous within its specific category [00:10:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Step 1: Identify and Reach Your Target Audience

1.  **Email Scraping:** Scrape emails of decision-makers from platforms like LinkedIn or tools like Apollo.io [00:10:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
2.  **Paid Ads:** Import these emails into custom match lists on platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads [00:10:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
    *   **Ad Content:** Use UGC (User-Generated Content) or AI Avatar ads (e.g., HeyGen for avatar, Eleven Labs for voice) to address customer pain points [00:11:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Create many variations (e.g., 100 different hooks, settings, backgrounds, content) and continuously test to find the lowest CPC (Cost Per Click) [00:11:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
    *   **Founder as Face:** Founders can make a digital clone of themselves for ads to build personal brand recognition, which can aid future funding rounds [00:13:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, as people tend to buy from people, not just brands [00:13:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
3.  **Cold Email:** Simultaneously cold email the scraped list using tools like MailReef (for server management) and SmartLead or Instantly AI (for sending and managing multiple inboxes) [00:14:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
    *   **Domain Isolation:** Use separate domains for transactional emails (core domain), newsletter marketing, and cold emails to protect the main product domain from being flagged as spam [00:15:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
    *   **Messaging:** Focus on problem-solution orientation, similar to ads [00:17:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Cold email can be highly effective when the messaging directly addresses a specific problem the target audience faces [00:18:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

### Step 2: Build a Media Company

[[building_successful_businesses_through_targeted_media_strategies | Building a media company]] creates significant leverage [00:23:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
1.  **Podcast Creation:** Record customer conversations, insights, and pain points, then format them into a podcast [00:21:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
2.  **Newsletter Distribution:** Send weekly podcast episodes to the scraped email list via services like MailerLite or Beehiiv, focusing on value and education [00:22:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.
3.  **Content Repurposing:** Use AI tools (like Swell AI) to transcribe podcasts, extract pain points, generate show notes, create blog posts, white papers, and short-form video clips [00:27:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
4.  **Omnipresent Social Media:** Schedule and distribute these repurposed clips across all platforms where customers spend time (LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) [00:28:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
    *   **Organic Growth Hacks:** Run Instagram-only ads with a call to action to "follow this account for more content like this" [00:29:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. This can drive followers at a low cost (e.g., 30 cents per follower) [00:30:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. The larger your social media accounts, the more free impressions you receive [00:30:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
    *   **LinkedIn Strategy:** Take short-form content from TikTok or Instagram Reels and upload them to LinkedIn for potential viral reach [00:29:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
5.  **Monetization & Leverage:**
    *   **Cost Center to Profit Center:** Sell ad placements within the podcast and newsletter to companies in the same space, turning marketing into a revenue source (e.g., subsidizing growth team costs) [00:24:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.
    *   **Negotiation Power:** Use owned media's reach and influence to negotiate better deals with partners or suppliers [00:23:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.
    *   **Brand Trust:** Consistent content builds trust and mental real estate in the target audience's mind, making them more likely to choose your brand [00:35:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.

This multi-pronged approach, though demanding consistent effort, allows companies to grow exponentially by layering growth curves rather than just linear growth [00:32:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>. An example showed an email newsletter generating 80,000 clicks per month for $450, equivalent to $500,000 in [[effective_use_of_seo_and_paid_ads_for_startup_growth | paid ads]] costs [00:33:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## Tactical Marketing for B2C

[[b2b_versus_b2c_startups | B2C]] marketing is highly competitive and requires exceptional marketing skills [00:39:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>.

### Step 1: Product and Initial Setup

1.  **Huge Total Addressable Market (TAM):** Crucial for [[marketing_strategies_for_new_product_launches | B2C]] success, as content needs to be broad enough to target a large population subset [00:39:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.
2.  **Application First:** Build an application that people genuinely want and that addresses a large audience [00:41:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. AI has changed the landscape for consumer apps, allowing single-purpose apps to succeed if done well [00:41:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
3.  **Pricing Strategy:** Consider impulse purchase pricing, like $7.99/week (translates to ~$29/month) [00:41:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.
4.  **Unique Name:** Choose a product name that avoids competition on Google's front page [00:42:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.

### Step 2: Customer Acquisition & Retention

1.  **Paid Ads (Facebook & TikTok):** Focus on conversion events like app installs and in-app actions (signup, paid action) [00:42:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. Continuously test different ad variations to find the most effective ones [00:42:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
2.  **UGC Creators & Testing:** Hire UGC creators (e.g., 5-10 for ~$1,000/month for daily videos) to produce content that serves as a test bed for what goes viral on platforms [00:42:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>.
3.  **Multi-Account Content Strategy:** Spin up multiple TikTok accounts (e.g., 10) and remix best-performing UGC content using AI (ChatGPT for scripts, HeyGen for video, Eleven Labs for audio, CapCut for editing) [00:43:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
4.  **Pixel Tracking & Remarketing:** Install pixels (Facebook, TikTok, Google) on your website. When users visit, they are pixeled, allowing you to run [[effective_use_of_seo_and_paid_ads_for_startup_growth | ads]] to them indefinitely on those platforms [00:44:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.
5.  **Email Nurturing:** Collect emails on the website to create an email nurture sequence that upsells them into the product [00:45:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.
6.  **Influencer Outreach & Affiliate Plays:**
    *   **Identify Influencers:** Scrape emails from YouTube channels or Instagram accounts in your category [00:46:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>, [00:48:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
    *   **Cold Outreach:** Contact them to inquire about their pricing [00:46:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.
    *   **Find Arbitrage:** Analyze average views versus suggested cost to find discrepancies in the "imperfect market" of influencer pricing [00:47:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.
    *   **Deal Structure:** Offer a three-video package (e.g., $1,500) combined with an affiliate commission (e.g., 30% recurring) [00:47:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. This creates "stickiness" and a moat against competitors, as influencers become financially invested in your product's success [00:48:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. Influencer marketing can yield significantly cheaper CPMs than direct ad buys [00:49:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

### Step 3: Programmatic SEO

For [[marketing_strategies_for_new_product_launches | B2C]] products, programmatic [[effective_use_of_seo_and_paid_ads_for_startup_growth | SEO]] can drive massive organic traffic [00:50:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
1.  **Target Keywords:** Identify thousands of long-tail, low-competition keywords related to your product (e.g., calorie counts, diet plans) [00:50:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>.
2.  **Domain Authority (DA):** As your site gains backlinks and trust (DA 40+), it becomes easier to rank for these keywords [00:50:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
3.  **AI-Generated Content:**
    *   Scrape top-ranking content for target keywords [00:51:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.
    *   Use AI to generate blog post outlines and write content section by section for quality and readability [00:51:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
    *   Publish a high volume of articles (e.g., 10,000) [00:52:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.
    *   **Human Optimization:** Once an AI-generated page receives traffic, a human SEO specialist or content writer edits and optimizes it to ensure it satisfies both Google's ranking factors and human readability [00:52:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.
4.  **Calls to Action (CTAs):**
    *   Place a CTA to "sign up for the app for free" after the first paragraph [00:53:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>.
    *   Ensure at least one CTA is visible within every frame of the scroll on both mobile and desktop [00:53:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>.
    *   Implement a full-screen pop-up CTA that appears after 25-50% scroll [00:53:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>.
    *   These CTAs also serve to pixel visitors, feeding them into the remarketing funnel [00:54:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

The combination of [[effective_use_of_seo_and_paid_ads_for_startup_growth | paid ads]], organic social, influencer marketing, and programmatic [[effective_use_of_seo_and_paid_ads_for_startup_growth | SEO]] creates a powerful acquisition strategy for [[marketing_strategies_for_new_product_launches | B2C]] products.

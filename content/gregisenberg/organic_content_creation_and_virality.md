David Park, co-founder of Jenny AI, successfully grew his AI startup from zero to $10 million ARR within a few years by leveraging an "incredible growth tactic playbook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This playbook, which he shares, is considered highly comprehensive for growth marketing in an AI startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. A key element of his strategy revolves around [[importance_of_organic_growth_and_audience_building | organic short-form content]] and [[growth_strategies_using_creators_and_social_media | influencer marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Organic Short-Form Content Strategy

David Park emphasizes the power of organic short-form content for achieving rapid growth, especially for AI startups whose products can be a "spectacle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### The Power of "Fresh Accounts"

Unlike traditional social media where follower count and channel history mattered significantly, current platforms allow "fresh accounts" with minimal followers to go viral instantly if the content is engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Park states that a single video on a new TikTok account can immediately go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

> [!info] Fresh Account vs. Million Followers
> A fresh account with 50 followers can outperform an account with 70,000 followers in engagement and views, demonstrating that content resonance, not follower count, drives virality today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Park would "unironically sponsor a fresh account made this week versus a YouTuber with a million Subs if they had similar views" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This is because fresh accounts are often "Juiced by the algorithm" and on an uptrend, while larger accounts might be on a downtrend or past their prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Furthermore, fresh accounts can be sponsored at a fraction of the cost, leading to a much better Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Creating Your Own Accounts & Finding a Creator

Instead of just sponsoring new accounts, companies can create these accounts themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
The strategy involves having a creator make a completely new "fresh account" to serve as the face of the product. This creator educates viewers on pain points the product solves and provides helpful advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This approach benefits creators by not "polluting their account with ads" and allows for a similar view count over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

#### Case Study: Ming May Duck and Jenny AI
Jenny AI partnered with Ming May Duck, who had around 300,000 followers on TikTok at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. They paid him $4,000 per month for 20 videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. His content, focused on writing emails and high-quality written content, aligned well with Jenny AI's writing tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This new account started from scratch and grew to 70,000 followers, accumulating half a billion views across platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. In the first month alone, they garnered 7 million impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

> "A video that can get one million views... it can add thousands in MRR [monthly recurring revenue] to your product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Getting 7 million views for $4,000 is considered a "quite good ROI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

The agreement was for a short commitment (around three months), which allowed testing the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Creators are receptive to monthly consistent revenue rather than one-off brand deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. David Park notes that 20 videos a month may sound daunting, but they can be quick (5-10 minutes a day) by focusing on new hooks and reusing successful older hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

### Content Format and Strategy

The importance of daily posting is to explore different content angles and hooks. Posting one video a day allows for 30 tests a month, significantly increasing the chances of finding a viral hit compared to one video a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. This iterative process of experimenting with skits, memes, humor, educational content, or straight ads, and then refining based on winners, leads to a "Mega Banger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. It's about taking "shots on goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. This is a core aspect of [[strategies_for_media_and_content_creation | strategies for media and content creation]].

#### The "Viral Series" Concept
The ultimate goal with creators is to find a "viral series" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. People are "creatures of habit" and repeatedly watch content that brings them comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Once a video goes viral, the key is to replicate it with minimal effort by slightly tweaking the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

> [!example] Examples of Viral Series
> *   **Spaghetti/Coat Hangers/iPads:** A person tests how many objects it takes to hold their weight. The series simply changes the object while maintaining the same format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.
> *   **"For every follower I have, I'll do X":** A creator gambles $1 for every follower or drinks a cup of milk for every thousand followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
> *   **Jenny AI's "POV: You have a paper or an essay due":** This series featured a relatable scenario (realizing an essay is due at an inconvenient time) always ending with Jenny AI providing the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This specific series generated over 300 million views and half a million dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

### Format Product Fit

It is crucial to have "format product fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Going viral for the sake of virality is "empty calories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. The viral series format must allow the product to seamlessly integrate and make sense to the audience. For instance, the "milk-drinking" series wouldn't work for Jenny AI, but would for a milk company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. A video might get 20 million views but have a negligible effect on conversions if it doesn't align with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Therefore, [[viral_content_creation_for_apps_on_social_media | viral content creation for apps on social media]] must focus on converting viewers.

### The Order of Virality (Lifecycle of Organic Content)

1.  **Farm Multiple Accounts:** Instead of one account per platform, create multiple accounts on each platform (e.g., seven accounts per platform, leading to 24 accounts posting daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. This increases the "surface area of luck" for content to go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
2.  **Experiment Heavily:** Test tons of hooks and video ideas with different creators. Look at competitors and other industries for trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
3.  **Find a Viral Video:** Through experimentation, a video will eventually go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
4.  **Turn into a Series:** Transform the viral video into a repeatable series by tweaking it over and over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
5.  **Post Series on Multiple Accounts:** Start tweaking and posting the successful series across all developed accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
6.  **Translate for International Audiences:** Create the same video with creators who speak different languages (e.g., Chinese, Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. Jenny AI saw good conversions from Mandarin videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
7.  **Sponsor Other Pages:** As the cycle winds down, sponsor meme pages or other accounts with insane reach to repost the viral videos, giving them a "second life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
8.  **Use for Paid Ads:** Leverage mega-viral content for paid advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
9.  **Return to Step One:** Eventually, copycats will emerge, the content will become played out, and the audience will get bored. At this point, it's necessary to go back to farming hooks and ideas and repeat the lifecycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

## Influencer Marketing

Influencer marketing is closely tied to organic content creation, as it leverages creators to produce and distribute content. This is a form of [[usergenerated_content_strategies | usergenerated content strategies]] and [[growth_strategies_using_creators_and_social_media | growth strategies using creators and social media]].

### Finding Influencers

The most effective way to find relevant influencers is to ask your existing users which influencers they watch that relate to your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. Asking for their Instagram or TikTok handles allows you to see who they actually follow and interact with, providing an honest view of who genuinely influences them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

> [!tip] Influencer Discovery Hack
> 1.  **Compile a List:** Gather a list of influencers from user interviews.
> 2.  **Create a New Account:** Make a fresh Instagram or TikTok account.
> 3.  **Manually Follow & Engage:** Follow only these influencers and watch their videos all the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.
> 4.  **Leverage the Algorithm:** The platform's algorithm will then start automatically suggesting other similar influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.
> 5.  **Identify Deals:** This method allows you to discover "craziest steals" – creators with few followers but amazing content who are likely to go viral soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. Sponsoring someone whose content appears on your "For You Page" when you're not following them is a strong indicator of their viral potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.

### Reaching Out to Influencers

When reaching out, utilize "all avenues of attack" including DMs, emails, and LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. Park has even used obscure platforms like Tumblr if that's where a creator had an old account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>. The effort put into finding these less obvious contact points makes your outreach stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.

> [!tip] Outreach Best Practices
> *   **Be Detailed and Tailored, but Concise:** Demonstrate you are a genuine fan of their content and why their audience would love your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
> *   **Focus on Human Connection:** Avoid corporate jargon like funding rounds or employee numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.
> *   **Indicate "Paid Promotion":** Clearly state that the partnership is a paid promotion to distinguish yourself from offers of free products or subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
> *   **Expect Low Response Rates:** Especially in the early days, most influencers will not respond. Develop a thick skin and focus on optimizing your outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. As your product gains recognition, it becomes easier to convince other creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.

### Negotiating with Influencers

Align incentives by making a percentage of the payment dependent on conversions or views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. This avoids paying all money upfront and losing leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. Be fully transparent about budget and expected ROI, and ask influencers to be transparent about their demographics and past sponsored video performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

> [!caution] Avoid Follower-Based Pricing
> Do not pay influencers based on follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. Articles suggesting charts for pricing by follower tiers are "garbage misinformation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. Focus on actual views and engagement.

### Posting Content

> [!info] Tailored Content is Key
> "Your sponsored content can't deviate too far from it [the influencer's usual content] or else it'll have... terrible retention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. Trust the influencer to create content similar to their existing successful posts, but manage the product placement (e.g., showing the product halfway through) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. Ideally, your product can be inserted into an influencer's existing popular series (e.g., "Top 10 AI tools") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>. This is an example of [[creating_engaging_content_for_different_platforms | creating engaging content for different platforms]].

To scale [[strategies_for_media_and_content_creation | content creation]], influencers need a clear blueprint for how the product should be portrayed and what engagement is expected, then be given autonomy to "cook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. This "set and forget" approach is vital for managing many partnerships without excessive micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>.

> [!summary] Direct vs. Subtle Ads
> Don't be afraid of videos looking like a "straightup ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>. Even if they get fewer views, direct ads convert better because they immediately address a pain point and offer a clear solution, which is more memorable for users with that specific need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>.

## Organic Content's Relationship with SEO and Paid Ads

While SEO and paid ads are important, David Park suggests they can be a "trap" for early-stage entrepreneurs due to their slower iteration cycles compared to organic content and influencer marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. He recommends starting with organic content first, as it provides quick feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. This aligns with the [[importance_of_organic_content_before_paid_ads | importance of organic content before paid ads]].

Organic content indirectly boosts SEO by increasing "brand name searches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>. Many users who see content on TikTok, for example, will not click the in-app link but instead search for the product's name directly on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. This organic search behavior signals legitimacy to Google, passively improving SEO without dedicated efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>.

Furthermore, successful organic content provides data that can be reused for paid ads. Organic virality shows what resonates with people, leading to better targeting and creative development for paid campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>. Paid ads were only integrated into Jenny AI's strategy once they had some "semblance of PMF [product-market fit]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>.

## Lessons from $5M to $10M ARR

The growth from $5 million to $10 million ARR for Jenny AI wasn't due to entirely new strategies, but rather scaling and refining the existing playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.

*   **Continued Organic Strategies:** All the organic content and influencer strategies described remained in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Marketing:** A significant portion of new revenue came from affiliate marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   **Acquisitions:** Jenny AI acquired a few startups, leveraging their existing knowledge to double the revenue of one acquisition in five months without significant marketing budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.
*   **Back to Basics (Retention & Conversion):** As the company scaled, there was a laser focus on improving core metrics like retention and conversion rates within the product funnel. Jenny AI reduced its monthly churn from 20% to 9.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. For B2C AI apps, churn rates can be notoriously high (50% monthly is not unheard of) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>, making this reduction a significant achievement.

## Final Tips

Success in organic content and influencer marketing requires a blend of creative and analytical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. It's an art form in some ways, but also a science of managing campaigns, tracking data, and identifying winning strategies and creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. Founders need to develop strong managerial and organizational skill sets, while also being willing to build "real relationships" with creators on a human level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>.

Leverage any common ground or "nepotism" to connect with creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. Finding a personal connection (e.g., growing up in the same neighborhood) makes influencers much more likely to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>.

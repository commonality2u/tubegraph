Negotiation is a crucial skill that can lead to significant cost savings for businesses and individuals, yet it is often overlooked or poorly executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. Most people, if asked, are willing to provide a significant discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

## Challenges of Internal Negotiation
Despite the potential savings, delegating negotiation within a company can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. Employees often do not care to negotiate because:
*   It can be awkward and uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.
*   It slows down processes; a deal might take weeks to finalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   The incentive structure is misaligned; saving a few thousand dollars for the company may only mean a small bonus for the employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

## The Business Model for Negotiation Services
A potential business opportunity lies in providing dedicated negotiation services, especially for large purchases and enterprise expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

### Software Procurement
One application of this model is negotiating software contracts for businesses. For example, a company called Tech Source specializes in negotiating on behalf of clients for enterprise software like Amazon S3, HubSpot, or Rippling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. This service involves evaluating current usage, seat numbers, and then negotiating and handling procurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. Savings can be substantial, with some clients achieving 60% to 70% reductions across their largest vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. This business model is particularly timely as many companies are actively seeking to reduce costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

### Large Personal Purchases
The concept can be extended to large personal purchases, such as houses or cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. The negotiation itself might only take a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   **Commission-Based Incentives:** A strong incentive model would involve a commission based on savings. For instance, if an asking price is $1 million and the service negotiates it down to $800,000, the negotiator could receive 20% to 25% of the $200,000 savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.
*   **Team Structure:** This business would be ideal for individuals who enjoy negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. A scalable approach could involve training a salesforce, potentially from regions like the Philippines or Latin America, hyper-incentivizing them, and equipping them with AI language models (LLMs) to draft and refine negotiation communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

### Opportunity in Price Discovery
For significant purchases like houses, there is often a lack of true "price discovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. The listing price might be merely an aspiration, and sellers often have more flexibility than buyers realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>. A skilled negotiator can ask the right questions to uncover this flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

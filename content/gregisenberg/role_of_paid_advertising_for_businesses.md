Paid advertising is presented as a fundamental and highly effective strategy for business growth, often overlooked or misunderstood due to market perceptions and misaligned incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55">[06:55]</a>. Despite common misconceptions, platforms like Facebook and Google Ads remain powerful tools for businesses to generate leads and drive revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40">[00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14">[09:14]</a>.

## Market Gap for Ad Consultants

There is a significant untapped market for "not douchy, non-agency companies" or single-person consultants who help businesses run [[use_of_digital_marketing_strategies_like_seo_and_facebook_ads | Facebook ads]] and simple Google search ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13">[00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40">[00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30">[10:30]</a>. Many startups and businesses struggle with setting up even basic campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32">[00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16">[01:16]</a>.

The current market for paid ad services is often dominated by:
*   **Expensive Agencies** Agencies are frequently too costly, large, and confusing for smaller businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30">[07:30]</a>.
*   **"Douchy Guys"** A common perception is that ad experts are young individuals "wearing a gold Rolex" who appear intimidating or untrustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35">[07:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00">[09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01">[11:01]</a>. This stereotype can deter many potential clients, especially in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13">[10:13]</a>.

This creates a vacuum for trusted, single-person ad consultants who can appeal to specific verticals, such as hair salons, female product owners, creative retreats, yoga retreats, or art installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33">[09:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12">[14:12]</a>.

## Benefits of Paid Ads

*   **Lead Generation and Monetization** Paid ads are highly effective for generating leads that can be quickly monetized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18">[09:18]</a>.
*   **Direct Impact** For one-person shows or small teams, ads provide a straightforward path to getting call bookings and clients, especially when large-scale branding campaigns are not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06">[20:06]</a>.
*   **Targeting Older Demographics** While some believe [[use_of_digital_marketing_strategies_like_seo_and_facebook_ads | Meta ads]] are "dead" for younger audiences, they perform exceptionally well for people over 40, who represent a significant market segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55">[15:55]</a>.
*   **Control and Predictability** The ability to "put money into the machine" to find target audiences provides a sense of control and reduces helplessness when trying to sell a product or event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21">[25:21]</a>.

## Business Models for Ad Consulting

A viable business model for a solo ad consultant involves:
*   **Performance-Based Pay** Instead of a monthly fee, consultants can take a percentage of revenue from sales generated through their ad campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42">[13:42]</a>. For instance, an ad consultant could contact event organizers, offer to fill their events using Facebook ads, and take a cut of every ticket sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15">[14:15]</a>.
*   **Advisory/Coaching** Consultants can sit with clients, open the ad dashboard, and provide advice on setting up funnels and lead generation, rather than acting as a full-service agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48">[12:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08">[13:08]</a>.

### Example: Yoga Retreats
One potential approach is to find yoga retreats or similar events that are not yet full, contact the organizers, and offer to use Facebook ads to sell tickets in exchange for a percentage of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01">[14:01]</a>. Event owners often excel at organizing but dislike the sales aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10">[15:10]</a>.

## Paid Ads vs. Organic Content

While paid ads offer direct reach, it is suggested that [[importance_of_organic_content_before_paid_ads | organic content]] should precede paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29">[20:29]</a>. Developing strong messaging through organic channels like Twitter or Instagram helps refine the pitch before investing in ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31">[20:31]</a>.

> "I don't think you should start with ads though that's my take because I think in order to create ads that are really high highly performing you have to have your messaging pretty dialed and I think the best way to get your messaging really dialed is to do organic content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29">[20:29]</a>

However, knowing how to run ads is a valuable skill in itself, as it provides a reliable method to attract customers when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04">[25:04]</a>. The ideal scenario combines both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:33">[25:33]</a>.

## The "Status Symbol" Fallacy

There's a perceived "status symbol" in the venture capital world, particularly from Silicon Valley, of not running ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27">[18:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15">[24:15]</a>. Companies may boast about growth without paid advertising as if it's a badge of honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49">[17:49]</a>. This mindset, rooted in seeking "cutting edge" approaches, can actually hurt small businesses that don't have extensive funding or a massive personal brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00">[19:00]</a>. For most businesses, especially smaller ones like a yoga retreat or a creative retreat, ads are an accessible and effective starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49">[19:49]</a>.

## Funnel Strategy

A key aspect of successful paid advertising is the implementation of a well-designed sales funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:58">[27:58]</a>.

### Components of a Funnel
*   **Opt-in Page** This is the first page, offering something of value (e.g., a free training video, a downloadable PDF, or a physical book) in exchange for an email address and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39">[29:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31">[31:31]</a>.
*   **Video Sales Letter (VSL)** A common next step where a free training video or similar content builds trust and provides value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46">[28:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01">[31:01]</a>. This acts as a pitch, giving prospects a taste of the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20">[31:20]</a>.
*   **Call Booking/Sales Page** At the end of the VSL, instead of directly selling a high-ticket item, the funnel leads to a free call booking with a sales coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05">[33:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:29">[33:29]</a>. This allows for personalized engagement to convert leads into customers.

### Tools for Funnel Building
*   **Framer** Used for creating visually appealing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07">[32:07]</a>.
*   **ClickFunnels** A more accessible tool for quick testing and funnel creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:16">[32:16]</a>.
*   **Calendly** For managing call bookings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22">[36:22]</a>.
*   **ConvertKit** For email marketing campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:58">[38:58]</a>.

### Key Metrics and Optimization
*   **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)** The primary focus is maximizing the return on investment from ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21">[26:21]</a>.
    *   **Example (June data)**: $86,000 spent on Facebook and Google ads yielded $252,000 in revenue, resulting in a 38% ROI on ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40">[34:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:18">[35:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32">[35:32]</a>.
*   **Continuous Optimization** Funnels are constantly tweaked and refined (e.g., landing page conversion rates, sales call scripts, video content, surveys) to improve performance over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46">[26:46]</a>.
*   **Tracking** While detailed attribution tracking (e.g., using Hyros) can be complex, a simpler approach is to focus on the overall monthly profit and loss and the ROAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:16">[41:16]</a>.
*   **"Shadow Funnel"** High-quality, free content (like YouTube videos) builds trust and makes prospects more receptive to entering a paid funnel, even if direct attribution is not tracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20">[42:20]</a>.

## The Art of Copywriting

Copywriting, the text used in ads and landing pages, is crucial for conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:38">[43:38]</a>.

### Copywriting Hacks
1.  **Status Increase** Good copy should suggest how the product or service will increase the user's status among their peers or make them more valuable (e.g., learning skills that enhance professional value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:29">[44:29]</a>.
2.  **Pain vs. Pleasure** Copy can be framed to either:
    *   **Move Away from Pain** Highlight how the product solves a painful problem (e.g., a portable microphone preventing airport hassles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:12">[46:12]</a>. This is often more effective during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:05">[47:05]</a>.
    *   **Move Towards Pleasure** Emphasize the positive benefits and desirable outcomes of using the product (e.g., the beautiful sound quality of a microphone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51">[46:51]</a>. This is typically more effective in prosperous times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:24">[47:24]</a>.

## Websites vs. Funnels

A key distinction is made between websites and funnels:
*   **Website** Acts primarily as a business card, showcasing what a company does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:42">[49:42]</a>.
*   **Funnels** A structured, step-by-step process designed to guide a stranger directly to becoming a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:48">[49:48]</a>.

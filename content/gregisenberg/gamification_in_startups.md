Getting started with a simple product is an effective way to generate new ideas, build a small audience, and gather feedback, which are all crucial steps for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. A simple starting point could be a course or a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This approach encourages entrepreneurs to avoid overthinking and to learn by launching their ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The initial product can serve as an "ignition" for a broader business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, as the journey of building a business involves many evolving ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Applying Gamification to Daily Activities

A significant opportunity exists in applying [[gamification_of_daily_activities_and_products | gamification]] principles to everyday activities that people inherently want to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. This approach involves turning common goals, such as better sleep, healthier eating, or consistent workouts, into a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>. By scoring points, competing with friends, or facing consequences for not tracking habits, users can be motivated to achieve their objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

### Benefits of Gamification

[[gamification_of_daily_activities_and_products | Gamification]] helps people achieve their goals by creating streaks and visible results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. Features like leaderboards, status indicators, badges, and streaks are product design tools that encourage users to reach their objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

### Examples of Gamified Products

*   **Eight Sleep Mattress App:** This smart mattress provides a "sleep fitness score" upon waking, along with data on REM and deep sleep, effectively gamifying the sleep experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
*   **Pokemon Sleep:** This app, released in 2022, reportedly generates $100 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. Users' Pokemon grow and evolve based on the quality of their sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This success stems from combining the nostalgia of Pokemon with a real-life goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.
*   **Sweatcoin:** During the web3 craze, Sweatcoin gamified walking by giving users a "coin" based on the number of steps they took <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
*   **Credit Card Points:** These programs incentivize spending by rewarding users with points that can be redeemed for various benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.

### Leveraging Intellectual Property (IP)

A key strategy for [[gamification_of_daily_activities_and_products | gamified]] products, as seen with Pokemon Sleep, is to license intellectual property (IP) from established brands and integrate it into the gamified concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. This approach can provide a strong hook and audience connection. While high-profile licenses might seem expensive, some can be surprisingly affordable, even for well-known brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.

## Startup Ideas Leveraging Gamification

The core idea for a [[gamification_of_daily_activities_and_products | gamified startup]] is to apply the "Pokemon Sleep for X" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>, where "X" represents a desired human behavior or goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.

*   **Gamified Sleep Tracking:** Beyond existing solutions, a product that scores sleep and allows competition among users who purchased a "how to sleep better" course could be developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
*   **Gamifying Developer Commits:** Developers are already familiar with the addictive GitHub commit grid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. A gamified system could track commits, establish leaderboards, and even offer points redeemable for rewards, similar to credit card points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. This niche has significant potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.
*   **Other Niche Gamified Habits/Goals:** The concept can be applied to countless other niches where people have clear goals, offering opportunities to gamify habits and drive desired behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

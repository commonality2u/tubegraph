The concept of "luxury software" is being superseded by a new wave: [[exploring_style_references_and_aesthetics | aesthetic software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:57">[01:52:57]</a>. This shift emphasizes the visual appeal and seamless [[importance_of_user_experience_and_design | user experience]] of software products.

## The Role of Aesthetics

Daniel Dalan, whose father is an architect, grew up fascinated by design and aesthetics from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:58">[01:46:58]</a>. He believes that aesthetics contribute significantly to the "perceived value" of what a product or brand is trying to convey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>. This principle applies directly to software products as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>.

Software products that emphasize aesthetics include:
*   **Superhuman** This email client is valued for its pleasing appearance, smooth operation, effective organization features, and integration of [[using_ai_tools_for_design | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. Some users are willing to pay a premium, such as $99 a month, for an aesthetically pleasing and efficient email client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.
*   **Raycast** Described as "nice" and "smooth" in its appearance and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:38">[01:54:38]</a>.

Aesthetics serve as a "status play" or "status symbol" in software, similar to how a luxury bag is worn for others to see, rather than solely for its material quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:58">[01:48:58]</a>. Features like the "Sent with Superhuman" tagline act as a built-in status symbol for "luxury businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

## Aesthetics as a Marketing Tool

When a product "looks nice," it naturally "grabs attention" and helps "make noise," which is vital for new products to gain visibility and "push traffic" to their platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">[01:42:04]</a>. Daniel leverages aesthetics when building products and announcing new features to gain attention and push traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:57">[02:30:57]</a>.

Daniel emphasizes that software aesthetics should "make sense," especially in a world saturated with information. Products should look "clean and clear" and seamlessly blend into the user's workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:44">[02:08:44]</a>.

### Aesthetic Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

When building an MVP, it's recommended to create a "really nice aesthetic landing page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:57">[02:42:57]</a>. This doesn't require extensive effort; simple improvements like choosing a good font, increasing font size, using a nice header, and a simple logo can suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:48">[02:44:48]</a>.

For the product itself, aesthetics can be incorporated if they don't consume too much development time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:48">[02:48:48]</a>. The primary focus for an MVP remains ensuring the core functionality ("what makes the car drive") is effective, with aesthetics being layered on later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:11">[02:51:11]</a>.

Tools like Vercel, [[best_practices_for_designing_in_figma | Framer]], and [[using_ai_tools_for_design | AI platforms]] can help quickly set up an aesthetically pleasing landing page within a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:09">[02:38:09]</a>. Incorporating "light animations" on a landing page can significantly enhance engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:09">[02:38:09]</a>.

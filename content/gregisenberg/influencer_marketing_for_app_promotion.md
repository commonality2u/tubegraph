Influencer marketing is a crucial distribution tactic for app growth, particularly for [[ai_app_marketing_strategies | AI-based apps]] and consumer apps looking for [[viral_consumer_app_growth_tactics | viral growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This strategy combines new application functionality, often powered by AI, with novel distribution methods to achieve significant user acquisition and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Blake Anderson's Approach to Influencer Marketing

Blake Anderson, who successfully scaled apps like Riz GPT (now Plug AI), Umax, and Cal AI to millions of downloads and substantial monthly revenue, outlines a framework for leveraging [[influencer_marketing_strategies | influencer marketing]] and [[using_social_media_and_influencers_for_app_marketing | social media]] for app promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Iterative Process for Virality
Rather than relying on a single trending method, Anderson advocates for an iterative approach to generating virality from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This involves:
*   **Developing New Hooks:** Continuously creating new ways to capture attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Product Positioning:** Strategically marketing the product to different target audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Split Testing:** Regularly testing various hooks across different videos and creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This includes assessing views generated by each hook and the conversion rate per view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Strategy:** Building a statistical model (mental or real) to inform future distribution efforts based on test results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This mirrors how platforms like Meta and [[tik_tok_marketing_strategies_for_consumer_apps | TikTok]] split-test creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### Targeting Influencers and Niches
When using [[influencer_marketing_and_outreach_tactics | influencer marketing]], it's important to:
*   **Identify Relevant Niches:** For an app like "Career AI," one would target influencers in EdTech, study tips, job application advice, and general productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Create Niche-Specific Hooks:** Develop different hooks tailored to each influencer niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Building Relationships with Influencers
Anderson emphasizes a unique approach to finding and collaborating with influencers:
*   **Avoid Marketplaces/Databases:** He does not use influencer marketplaces or databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Personal Relationships:** The key is to develop personal relationships with influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Influencers receive hundreds of messages daily, making it hard to differentiate serious companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Embedding oneself within the industry and building connections helps establish trust and open doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Quantity and Quality in Outreach:** Early on, it's crucial to prioritize both quantity and quality. This means reaching out to thousands of creators and messaging them on every platform, even going so far as to contact their family members to get in touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Nurture Relationships:** After initial contact, treat influencers well and become friends with them to unlock endless opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Engineering for Virality
Anderson integrates virality into the product design process:
*   **Product Hooks:** Identify which features or "tools" within an application are most likely to go viral on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Design for Engagement:** For example, Umax's facial analysis ratings, presented as a six-factor Madden-like rating system, were designed because they resonated with users, leading to more likes, comments, and shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   **Trend Creation:** For "Career AI," a six-factor resume rating system could be designed to align with popular EdTech content, encouraging creators to post their results. Similarly, a career analysis quiz could generate a "trend" where users react to their recommended careers, fostering social media discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

> [!TIP] Optimizing for Virality
> Instead of just optimizing for number of users multiplied by profit per user, consider optimizing for `(number of users)^N * (profit per user)` where N is greater than one. This means accepting a lower LTV per download in exchange for more people using the platform, which can lead to market domination and increased Word of Mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. This approach leverages the unquantifiable impact of widespread usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

### Marketing Existing Industries
The strategy can also involve applying AI to an existing, "archaic" industry to make it easier for the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Cal AI, for instance, revolutionized calorie tracking by using AI to simplify a process that many found cumbersome with traditional apps like MyFitnessPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The addition of "AI" to the name can signify innovation in a stagnant industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

Even when facing large competitors like Duolingo, a new app can succeed by:
*   **Integrating New AI Functionality:** Building a language tutoring app that uses the latest AI capabilities (e.g., dynamic voice models) to offer a better, more adaptive learning experience than static modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.
*   **Novel Distribution Strategies:** Leveraging new [[paid_advertisement_methods_for_app_growth | advertising methods]] and [[influencer_marketing_on_tik_tok | TikTok marketing strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.
*   **Incentive Alignment:** Unlike large, established companies (e.g., MyFitnessPal, Duolingo), smaller teams often have stronger incentives to iterate and progress quickly, leading to superior functionality and marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is not always to take market share from incumbents, but to create new market share by pioneering new ways for people to learn and improve themselves using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

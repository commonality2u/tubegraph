From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Frey, an "online directory King," teaches how to build a cashflowing online directory that can generate between $2,000 and $10,000 a month in passive income, requiring only about 15 minutes of work per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. His first directory, built in October 2022, has been monetized for 18 months straight, requires approximately 15 minutes of maintenance per month, and earned around $2,300 in revenue in the last month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

While any content management system (CMS) can be used, Frey specifically uses WordPress for his demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Why WordPress?

Frey demonstrates building a directory using WordPress, noting that it's a "dumb way" to build nowadays, but it's "so dumb it's inspiring" because it shows that you can brute force it to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. He admits to playing with Framer and seeing many builds with it, suggesting it as a potential alternative, but emphasizes that simple and basic themes on WordPress, or even Elementor Pro, are viable options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>. The simplicity of this approach can lead to a consistent income of $2,000-$5,000 per month, often referred to as "mailbox money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.

## The Static Pillar Page Directory

Frey's preferred method for building directories on WordPress is the "static pillar page directory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. This format is often "slept on" but is effective for [[Growing an online directory using SEO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>.

The key characteristics of this format are:
*   **Super long page** The entire content is on a single, comprehensive page, utilizing an outdated but still effective SEO principle known as a "pillar page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
*   **SEO Optimization**
    *   Includes a header one (H1) with the target keyword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.
    *   Features a table of contents to navigate the long page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.
    *   Targets city-specific keywords (e.g., "Dog Park Long Beach," "Dog Parks Los Angeles") on the same page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.
    *   Each listing includes a nice photo, data enrichment (e.g., amenities), address, phone number, hours, and an embedded map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.
    *   Internal linking strategy is simple, with links to different states to view dog parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.
    *   A significant advantage is the keyword clusters that result, allowing a single state page to rank for hundreds or even thousands of keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.
*   **Data Structure** A sample directory for dog parks in Los Angeles uses this static pillar page format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>.
    *   The most searched pages on programmatic directories are often the location pages, making this static pillar page approach effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

## Monetization

This static pillar page format is ideal for [[Monetizing online directories with display ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. Due to the naturally long pages, many ad placements can be included, similar to how a longer YouTube video generates more revenue from more ad placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>.

Beyond display ads, an online directory can serve as a foundation for a larger business idea. For example, a dog park directory could evolve into:
*   A Software as a Service (SaaS) product for public parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   A consumer product that competes with services like The Farmer's Dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>.
*   An affiliate marketing play, collecting data via a lead magnet or newsletter, or partnering with pet-related companies like BarkBox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>.

Even a "boring" and simple directory can provide significant income, allowing you to pay bills or pursue bigger projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>.

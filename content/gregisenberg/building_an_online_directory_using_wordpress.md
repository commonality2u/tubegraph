Frey, an expert in online directories, shares his insights on how to build and monetize online directories, including how he achieved $2,300 in revenue in one month from his first directory website, which requires only about 15 minutes of maintenance per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. His methods teach how to create a directory capable of generating between $2,000 and $10,000 per month in [[monetizing_online_directories_with_passive_income | passive income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Examples of Successful Online Directories
Frey highlights several examples of successful, simple online directories, demonstrating their traffic and monetization potential:
*   **RoadsideAmerica.com**: A directory of quirky roadside attractions in the United States, receiving 85,000 monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. It monetizes through display ads and is estimated to make $5,000 to $7,000 passively per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **AtlasObscura.com**: A worldwide directory of off-the-beaten-path attractions, boasting 7.1 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. It monetizes primarily through display ads and also sells a book, conservatively estimated to earn around $30,000 per month from AdSense, potentially up to $50,000 or $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **FindAGrave.com**: A directory for finding burial sites, attracting 1.4 million monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This site also monetizes via AdSense and is estimated to earn $60,000 to $70,000 per month, potentially up to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

These examples underscore the potential for even "boring" or visually simple websites to generate substantial income through targeted traffic and relevant content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

## Building a Profitable Directory: Step-by-Step
Frey outlines a comprehensive approach to [[how_to_start_an_online_directory | building an online directory]], focusing on creating "evergreen, location-based directories" that require minimal updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### [[finding_and_validating_a_niche_for_a_directory | Finding and Validating a Niche]]
The first steps involve identifying and confirming the viability of a directory idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

1.  **Keyword Research with Ahrefs**: Frey uses Ahrefs' Keyword Explorer by typing "near me" to find local queries with high search volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
    *   **Sweet Spot**: He looks for keywords with 30,000 to 100,000 monthly searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
    *   **Keyword Difficulty**: While keyword difficulty can be misleading, generally, anything under 20 is considered easy to rank for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Frey has successfully ranked for keywords with difficulty scores of 70 on fresh domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
    *   **Keywords to Avoid**:
        *   **Seasonal Niches**: E.g., "pumpkin patches near me," as monetization is limited to a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
        *   **Difficult-to-Obtain Data**: E.g., "earthquake near me," where data collection might be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
        *   **Big Branded Keywords**: E.g., "Taco Bell near me," as established brands likely already have a solution and search intent is too one-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Multi-Dimensional Search Intent**: Look for keywords with fragmented search intent, meaning people are looking for specific types or features within a niche (e.g., "indoor dog park," "off-leash dog park") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. This allows for data enrichment to solve user problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. For example, "dog parks near me" gets 73,000 monthly searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

2.  **Competitive Research**:
    *   **Google Search**: Search for competitor directories using keywords like "Dog Park Los Angeles" to find existing sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
    *   **Identify Opportunities**: Look for directories that are basic or unhelpful, like the example of a dog park directory that only lists names and addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Such sites, despite their simplicity, can still attract significant traffic (e.g., 21,000 monthly visitors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>, indicating an unmet need that a better directory can fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
    *   **SEO is a "PVP Game"**: The goal is to build something superior and capture existing traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

3.  **Validate with Social Listening (Reddit)**:
    *   Search Reddit for discussions related to your niche (e.g., "Dog Park Los Angeles Reddit") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.
    *   Look for forums where people are asking for specific information or expressing difficulty in finding what they need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
    *   This confirms that Google Maps isn't satisfying all user needs, indicating a problem worth solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. A clear signal is when users express a desire for more curation, hyper-specific features, or descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

### [[using_tools_like_ahrefs_and_web_scraping_for_directory_data_collection | Data Collection (Web Scraping)]]
Once the niche is validated, the next step is to gather data.

*   **Web Scraping Tools**: Frey uses Outscraper's Google Map scraper, though many tools exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.
*   **Google Maps Categories**: Before scraping, search Google Maps to see if an exact category exists for your niche (e.g., "dog park") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. Using an exact match category yields cleaner data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
*   **Plain Queries**: If no exact category exists, use a plain query (e.g., "off leash dog parks"), but expect more "junk data" that will require cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.
*   **Data Parameters**: Select essential data points for scraping, such as name, phone number, address, postal code, state, reviews, street view, working hours, and location link (for data enrichment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.
*   **Cleaning Junk Data**:
    *   Manually remove listings without addresses or with very few reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.
    *   [[using_ai_in_online_directory_creation_and_growth | AI tools]] like ChatGPT can help parse data, but manual initial cleaning is often needed to avoid removing good quality listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

### Data Enrichment
This is a critical step to differentiate your directory.

*   **Identify Desired Features**: Based on keyword research and social listening, determine what specific features users are looking for (e.g., for dog parks: water fountains, shade, benches, dog bags, trash cans, indoor/off-leash options) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
*   **Manual Enrichment (Initial Approach)**: Frey's early directories involved manually going through Google Maps reviews for each listing to identify recurring tags and features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. This is tedious for large datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.
*   **Automated Enrichment (Future/AI-assisted)**: Frey is developing a tool that uses the Google Maps location ID from scraped data to automatically analyze reviews for specific keywords (e.g., "shade") and populate corresponding columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>. This significantly streamlines the process and allows for deeper, more useful data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

### Website Implementation with WordPress
Frey demonstrates how to implement the directory data, even with simple tools like WordPress.

*   **CMS Choice**: While other options like Framer or Bolt.new are emerging, WordPress with basic themes (like Elementor Pro, used by Frey for his first site) can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
*   **Static Pillar Page Directory**: This is a "level one" directory build, characterized by a single, comprehensive, long page containing all content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.
    *   **Structure**:
        *   Header with keyword (H1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.
        *   Table of contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.
        *   Target city-specific keywords (e.g., "Dog Park Long Beach") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.
        *   Individual listings with enriched data (e.g., features like shade, water fountains) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
        *   Basic information: address, phone number, hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.
        *   Embedded maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>.
    *   **[[seo_optimization_for_directory_websites | SEO Strategy]]**: This format leverages [[seo_strategies_for_online_directories | SEO strategies]] by targeting high-volume location-based keywords on a single page, which helps rank for numerous related keywords (e.g., one state page can rank for 1,300 keywords) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>. The most searched pages on programmatic directories are often the location pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.
    *   **Monetization**: Pillar pages are ideal for display ad [[monetization_strategies for online directories|monetization]] due to their length, allowing for many ad placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
    *   **Internal Linking**: A simple internal linking strategy can be implemented at the bottom of the page, linking to different states or regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.

## Expanding Beyond Passive Income
While simple directories can provide "mailbox money" to cover bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>, they can also serve as a foundation for much larger ventures:

*   **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Use the directory's traffic to funnel users into a related SaaS product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. For example, a dog park directory could evolve into a SaaS product for managing public parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.
*   **Consumer Products**: Leverage the niche traffic to sell consumer products relevant to the audience (e.g., a dog park directory could lead to selling dog-related products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>.
*   **Lead Generation**: Programmatic directories can be used to sell leads to service-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.
*   **Data Collection**: Collect valuable user data through lead magnets or newsletters to understand the audience better, which can be immensely valuable for future business development (e.g., like BarkBox's acquisition for its data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Marketing**: Integrate affiliate programs aligned with the directory's niche (e.g., pet product affiliates on a dog park directory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.

The process of [[validating_and_promoting_online_directory_ideas | finding an idea]], validating it, and gathering/parsing data remains the same regardless of whether the goal is a small lifestyle business or a large-scale startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>.

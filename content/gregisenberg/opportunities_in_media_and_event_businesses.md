In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), significant opportunities are emerging within media and event businesses, particularly for those that can leverage data advantages and network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. While starting a business has never been easier, the most challenging businesses to sustain are often the easiest to initiate due to intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

## Strategy for Sustainable Media Businesses

A strategic approach for building a sustainable media business involves three key steps:
1.  **Gain Attention** The initial focus should be on capturing an audience's attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
2.  **Acquire Data** Once attention is secured, the next step is to acquire user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
3.  **Monetize with Tools/AI** The final stage involves monetizing by building AI-powered tools, co-pilots, and assistance software based on the collected data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This approach allows for the creation of a sustainable business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### The Importance of High-Value Niches
When considering media businesses to acquire or incubate, prioritizing a "high-value niche" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. For example, while Mr. Beast has billions of viewers, his audience is considered "low value" economically because they are primarily children who lack purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

## Specific Opportunities

### Acquiring Media Brands
Established media brands with strong recognition in a high-value niche present significant opportunities. An example of such a target is TechCrunch, which possesses a strong brand name and a high-value niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Though it was acquired by AOL, it may now be under-monetized and struggling to define its current identity, suggesting a potential acquisition opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### Event Series
Event series that have built a loyal following can also be attractive targets. The dream scenario for some is to acquire a well-known event like South by Southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. TED, an event series that successfully transformed into a media company, is currently for sale, indicating a real-world opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### Monetizing Community and Data
The key to unlocking value in media and event businesses, especially with the advent of AI, lies in monetizing their existing communities and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. For instance, a yachting website with a large community reading news could [[Vibe Coding to Production Code | "vibe code"]] data tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. These tools could track yacht prices or maintenance costs, and this data could then be used to sell related services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

While there has always been an opportunity to re-monetize communities that are not properly leveraged, AI makes it significantly easier and cheaper to build the necessary tools for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. AI has also created new use cases, such as the [[Cal AI and the Future of Niche Apps | Cal AI]] app, which uses LLMs to calculate calories from pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

## Challenges and Competitive Advantages

The rise of AI brings unprecedented competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:06">[03:05:06]</a>. It's now easier to lose all equity value in a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. Easy-to-start businesses, like simple to-do list apps, face rapid competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Pricing for many AI-powered tools is expected to go to zero due to the rapid influx of similar apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

For instance, a local newsletter business can be entirely automated using AI agents to source news, write content, and format it, making it more detailed and fact-checked than human-written versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This leads to concerns about inboxes being "overloaded with great content that's written by AI," making traditional content businesses "freaking hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

To survive and thrive, businesses need "moats" more than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. A **data advantage** or a **network effect advantage** are crucial for an AI business to remain competitive and successful in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Social networks and communities, which inherently build network effects, are particularly interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Ultimately, companies that control the devices (e.g., Apple) are likely to capture much of the value as AI functionality becomes integrated into operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

An important competitive advantage for any business dealing with sensitive information, especially in the age of AI, is security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. Building a reputation as "the secure" option in a field can create a strong moat, similar to how OnePassword's trustworthiness is its primary competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.

Finally, having a strong **audience brand** is key, as distribution is valuable and creates an "unfair competitive advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

Hunter Isacson, who has garnered over 300 million downloads for his consumer apps, shares his playbook for achieving significant growth, aiming from 0 to $1 million Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) in the consumer app space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He emphasizes that while building a business is not simple, there is a current opportunity in consumer AI and mobile apps to generate substantial revenue without raising venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Hunter Isacson's Playbook for $1 Million MRR in Consumer Apps

Hunter Isacson's approach focuses on a simple, user-centric process for [[development_of_startup_ideas_into_apps | developing startup ideas into apps]] and achieving rapid growth:

### 1. Build a Simple Experience (MVP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>
Start by identifying the bare-bones Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features that can solve a core problem, even if rough around the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. The goal is to keep it simple, avoiding overly complicated user journeys with branching flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.

### 2. Test Content Early & Get Users On Quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>
Before the app even goes live, test content on platforms like [[tik_tok_strategies_for_consumer_saas_apps | TikTok]] or Instagram Reels to gauge user response to the app's premise and formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Getting a few hundred or thousand initial users is crucial for early feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

### 3. Define a Core Action (Northstar Metric) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>
Select one primary metric that matters more than others and orient all decisions around increasing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. This metric helps in making clear trade-off decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
*   **Wink (make new friends app)**: Percentage of users getting a match on their first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   **NGL (anonymous messaging app)**: Percentage of users sharing their link and a few replies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. This also made viewers more willing to send messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   **Bags (crypto app)**: How many people fund their accounts and make one trade on the first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

### 4. Achieve High Percentage of Core Action Completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>
Aim for over 90% of users to complete the core action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. This indicates a very successful [[creating_engaging_user_experiences_in_mobile_apps | engaging user experience]] and product-market fit.

### 5. Continuous Seeding and Growth Loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>
Once the core action is proven, the focus shifts to getting more people on the app by applying pressure through seeding in different audiences and niches, including working with creators in various countries and time zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.
*   **Incorporate Sharing/Inviting**: Part of the core action should ideally involve a sharing or inviting mechanism, like hard invite gates seen in apps like Laps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. This increases the K-factor and reduces reliance on external advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
*   **NGL's Approach**: NGL leveraged the new Instagram link feature, training hundreds of millions of people on how to use it, which became their key growth lever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. It cost less than $10,000 for marketing to achieve 250 million downloads by effectively seeding the app and activating a viral growth loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Bags.fm's Approach**: Bags started with growth loops from early days, including a Twitter login that allowed users to claim and share a "bags link." A leaderboard of inviters further incentivized sharing and created hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. This built a community and grew their Twitter following to over 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.
*   **Paid vs. Organic**: Seeding can be organic or paid, using small amounts ($50-$100) to influencers to post content, aiming for one viral video to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.

### Hallow: Digitizing Religion for Modern Audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
Hallow, the top app for Christian and Catholic prayers, modernized religious content by making the Bible mobile, digital, colorful, and adding features like push notifications to appeal to millennials and Gen Z <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **[[monetization_strategies_for_mobile_apps | Monetization]]**: They offer yearly plans and a friends and family plan for up to six members, which is effective for health and spirituality apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Daily Engagement**: The app excels in daily use cases with abundant single-player content like daily prayers, sleep meditations, and minute meditations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Single-Player First with Multiplayer**: It prioritizes a strong single-player experience, then adds multiplayer elements like community challenges as a growth lever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Locket: Leveraging New Platform Features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>
Locket was among the first mainstream apps to utilize the iPhone's widget functionality socially, allowing users to share photos directly to friends' home screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Its success was driven by [[tik_tok_strategies_for_consumer_saas_apps | TikTok]] communities focused on relationships and best friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Future Opportunities**: Similar opportunities exist with new iOS features like Live Activities and lock screen widgets, which are currently under-explored and could see major viral successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### NGL (Not Gonna Lie): New Channel for Old Ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>
NGL's success came not from a new idea (anonymous messaging apps existed before) but by finding a new distribution channel: Instagram's link feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This highlights the strategy of taking popular past ideas and applying them to new channels or with new economics (e.g., cheaper distribution via social media and creators) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

### Pangu: AI-Injected Virtual Pets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>
Pangu reinvents the virtual pet concept by injecting a high degree of AI, creating a more human-like experience with AI characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>. This exemplifies how old ideas can find new life with new technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>.

## Building a Strong Brand

A crucial aspect of app growth is building a brand people love and understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
*   **Simple, Resonant Names**: Hunter's apps (Wink, NGL, Bags) have simple names that resonate with users, often using slang from a specific community (e.g., "Bags" in crypto, "NGL" for "Not Gonna Lie") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. This helps set a young, comfortable, and colloquial tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Authentic Voice**: Maintain authenticity in public communication, being real with how the app is presented. This includes being memeable, funny, and relatable, making users feel comfortable and understood by the app's language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. An authentic brand voice increases affinity and trust, providing an unfair advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## Future Trends and Opportunities in Mobile App Development

Hunter Isacson is particularly interested in:
*   **Crypto**: The potential for crypto to go mainstream with regulation and consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.
*   **Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses**: Anticipates these will be the "next step in hardware," allowing for immersive, sharable experiences where AI models could be prompted via voice (like a "Jarvis AI") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. He predicts phones will serve as the driving compute for these lightweight glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>.
*   **Local AI Models on Phones**: Foresees a future where phones become advanced enough to run large language models (LLMs) locally, rather than solely relying on cloud processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

For young people and aspiring tech entrepreneurs, Hunter advises focusing on the **consumer mobile app space** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. This area offers ample opportunities to:
*   Understand human psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   Build products people love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   Figure out how to go viral and create global experiences that touch the whole world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.
*   The tools for consumer app development are also becoming increasingly accessible, potentially removing the need for technical expertise in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.

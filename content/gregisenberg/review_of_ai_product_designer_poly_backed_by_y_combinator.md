Poly is an AI product designer startup backed by Y Combinator, claiming to allow users to write English prompts and receive "beautiful designs" and "production ready code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It is advertised as a tool to help non-designers create "production ready designs and front-end code with AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This article provides a review of Poly based on a first-time, live-on-camera test, including a comparison with another popular AI design tool, [[comparing_ai_product_designers_poly_vs_vz | VZ]].

## First Impressions and Features

Upon signing up, Poly automatically creates a first project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The interface resembles a chat-GPT style format for design, where users can type or use a microphone to describe what they want to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. A notable feature is the ability to upload an image, allowing users to draw a wireframe on a napkin and upload it for Poly to work from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Poly operates on a credit system: free accounts receive 250 credits, with 50 credits used per page and 25 credits per component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The user can also switch between light and dark modes and adjust settings like font, radius, and colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## The Test: YouTube Engagement Predictor

To test Poly, a startup idea for a YouTube analytics and prediction tool was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The idea, described as a potential multi-million dollar business, is an algorithm that simulates how thousands of users would react to a YouTube video based on its title and thumbnail, predicting comments, likes, and subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

The initial prompt to Poly included a screenshot of a similar tweet analytics tool and specified a "glassy, minimalist, and with colorful calls to action" design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## First Design Attempt and Feedback

Poly's first output was a landing page named "Predict," with the tagline "AI powered analytics to optimize your YouTube content and maximize your engagement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The landing page included sections for "AB testing" and "engagement prediction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

However, the user expressed disappointment that it was only a landing page and not the actual product interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Clicking on "analytics" or "get started" yielded no functional result, only a black screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The design did not feel "glassy" as requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This highlighted the need for specific design terminology, such as "glass morphism," to achieve desired aesthetic results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. It also suggested that Poly, as an [[the_role_of_product_design_in_ai_startups | AI product designer]], might not fully understand the user's intent or proactively ask clarifying questions about desired "vibe" or "taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## Second Design Attempt and Comparison with VZ

In the second attempt, the user explicitly asked Poly to implement "glass morphism" and expressed disappointment with the irrelevance of the initial product images, which looked like generic website analytics dashboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

During the wait for Poly's second generation, a comparison was initiated with [[comparing_ai_product_designers_poly_vs_vz | VZ]].
VZ provided more transparency, displaying its reasoning ("I'll create a SaaS application that helps YouTubers predict...") and outlining its design approach before generating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. VZ's output was strikingly similar to the provided image, literally copying elements, but it did build out a functional-looking product interface with "Version A" and "Version B" for [[product_management_with_ai_tools | AB testing]] content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. It also included "AI recommendations" and prediction statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

Poly's second attempt showed significant improvement, generating a more functional product interface rather than just a landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. It included features like "Version A" with options for "image," "video format," and "emoji," (though "image" and "emoji" were not relevant for YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. The design featured a "commutative engagement chart," "statistical confidence," "recent optimizations," and "AI suggestions," which were deemed "pretty cool" and potentially "more in-depth" than VZ's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. The design was "a little more glossy" and "beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. Poly also offered a helpful hover feature on charts to see specific data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

A key advantage of Poly is its ability to generate the underlying code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

While Poly improved significantly with clearer prompts, it required more iterative input compared to VZ. VZ's transparency in its thought process and direct feedback on design terms (e.g., admitting it needed to "enhance" glass morphism) provided a better user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. Poly, on the other hand, felt like "shouting into a dark hole" without immediate feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

Visually, both tools produced comparable designs, with VZ being slightly nicer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. Poly was also perceived as slightly slower in generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.

The overall recommendation for [[the_evolving_scope_of_ai_in_product_design_and_development | building a successful AI startup]] using [[building_ai_startup_using_ai_tools | AI tools]] is to experiment with multiple tools, as each may have unique strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. For instance, VZ might be better for [[the_potential_for_ai_in_generating_production_ready_designs | visual design]], while Poly offers code generation. Combining tools, like using VZ to refine a design and then importing it into Poly for code, could maximize output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. This approach extends to other areas, such as using multiple AI tools for [[product_management_with_ai_tools | marketing]] or writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.

The YouTube analytics prediction tool idea (a potential [[ai_startup_ideas | AI startup ideation and framework]]) remains a strong concept that could be built using these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.

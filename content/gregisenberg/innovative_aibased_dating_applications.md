The current landscape of dating applications primarily focuses on superficial aspects, with most platforms being "all based on looks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. Users typically swipe based on a person's appearance, despite dating profiles often including other information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. This approach fails to capture deeper compatibility factors such as humor and intelligence, which are crucial for people connecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

## Limitations of Current Dating Apps
Many single individuals are growing "tired of swiping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>, highlighting a need for more innovative approaches. The current apps do not accurately assess aspects like humor or intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

## AI for Enhanced Compatibility
The advent of [[emerging_trend_of_ai_character_apps_in_tech_industry | AI]] presents a significant opportunity to develop dating applications that move beyond appearance-based matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. [[incorporating_ai_features_in_applications | AI]] can facilitate mechanisms for determining compatibility based on a broader range of traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.

### Proposed AI-Driven Features
*   **Humor-Based Matching**: One idea involves an app where users swipe on memes instead of faces, allowing the [[using_ai_in_mobile_apps | application]] to gauge a user's sense of humor and match them accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
*   **Eliminating Swiping**: A radical approach suggests removing the swipe feature entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. After an initial onboarding, possibly involving meme preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>, the [[ai_dating_coach_apps_and_their_impact | AI]] could directly assign users to a blind date, complete with a set time and location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **Integrated Personal Data**: The [[ai_dating_coach_apps_and_their_impact | AI]] could integrate data from various external [[successful_ai_applications_and_startups | applications]] like Goodreads, Netflix, or Strava to gather information about a user's interests and lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. This could even extend to users' "open pages" (personal websites displaying their life statistics), providing a rich source of compatibility data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
*   **AI-Powered Prompts**: The [[ai_dating_coach_apps_and_their_impact | AI]] could provide prompts for conversation, identifying shared interests like movies or running, becoming increasingly specific based on aggregated data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.
*   **Personalized AI Matchmaker**: This vision culminates in a "personalized [[ai_dating_coach_apps_and_their_impact | AI]] matchmaker" that essentially facilitates "arranged marriages" by [[using_ai_in_recruitment_and_outreach | AI]], while still allowing users to choose if they want to continue the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:04]</a>.

### Benefits
Such [[live_interactive_experiences_for_dating | AI-driven]] dating apps would streamline the dating process by handling logistics like setting up meeting times and locations, removing the burden of manual coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

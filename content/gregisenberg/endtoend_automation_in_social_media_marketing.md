The concept of automating a marketing team with [[AI Agents in Marketing Automation|AI agents]] to put content on autopilot, once seemingly futuristic, is now a tangible reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This article details an end-to-end workflow designed to [[Creating Automated Marketing and Sales Processes with AI|create content on autopilot]] that actively drives engagement, such as likes and comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This comprehensive system aims to save users 10 to 15 hours per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> and enables faster testing of content angles, hooks, and topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## The Automated Content Workflow

The described workflow leverages various AI tools and platforms to automate the entire content creation and publishing process, specifically demonstrated for LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### 1. Data Collection and Analysis

The initial phase involves analyzing existing high-performing content to gather context and insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Topic Input** Users input a keyword or topic into a chat interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Web Scraping** The system utilizes Appify to scrape the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>:
    *   It scrapes the top 20-30 YouTube videos with high engagement related to the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   It scrapes posts from X (formerly Twitter) related to workflow automation and AI, including the user's own top-performing posts to identify brand voice and themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Content Transcription** All scraped YouTube videos are automatically transcribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Data Consolidation** All collected data—transcribed YouTube videos (hooks, titles, content) and X posts—are merged into one large text block, serving as a research phase to ensure sufficient context for Large Language Models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This automated research eliminates the need for manual, time-consuming efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### 2. Content Idea Generation

An [[AI Agents in Marketing Automation|AI agent]], specifically a content idea generator, connects to an OpenAI LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   This agent scans the consolidated text block to find fresh angles and content ideas, avoiding mere replication of researched content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   The prompt instructs the AI to generate actionable marketing-related content ideas based on the provided context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   It specifies desired output formats: short and clear titles, scroll-stopping hooks, optimal content formats, and unique angles focusing on how marketers can [[Scaling businesses through automation|scale their efforts using AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   Instructions are given to avoid excessive technical jargon and tailor content to a specific marketing audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### 3. Fact and Trend Research

To prevent "hallucination" and ensure factual accuracy, a research agent using Perplexity goes out to find supporting data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   This agent identifies real use cases with statistics, trends, insights, marketing use cases, industry ideas, and case studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   The goal is to gather as much data as possible around marketing angles with workflow automation and AI to feed into the content agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### 4. Content and Image Creation

Once ideas and research are combined, they are fed into a LinkedIn content agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **LLM Selection** Claude 3.7 Sonnet is preferred for content writing due to its strong writing capabilities, especially when provided with extensive context and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Prompting Guidelines**
    *   **Brand Voice**: Instructions include writing with authentic expertise, direct communication, confidence, avoiding formality, corporate jargon, and marketing speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
    *   **Content Structure**: Create narrative-driven posts with actionable insights and takeaways, only using relevant data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
    *   **AI Tells**: Explicit instructions to avoid common AI "tells" such as hashtags, emojis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, and M-dashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
    *   **Role Framing**: The LLM is framed as a "LinkedIn content strategist and conversion copywriter" to ensure content leads readers through a journey with strong hooks, builds interest and desire, provides value, and includes a clear call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **Image Generation** The workflow uses the OpenAI image generation model to create accompanying images for the post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. While dynamic prompts are possible, a simple 3D image communicating an AI system is used as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. A potential improvement is to link to a Google Drive folder of personal photos for a more authentic feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

### 5. Human in the Loop & Publishing

To allow for review and refinement, a "human in the loop" step is integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.
*   The system sends a link to the generated Google Doc in Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
*   Users can review and edit the content before publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   An "approve" button in Slack allows for direct publication to the social media platform, such as LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

## Key Tools Utilized

*   **Inaden**: The primary platform for building and running the automated workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

*   **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**: Considered the best writing LLM at the time of recording, used for content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Google Docs**: Serves as the output location for the generated content, facilitating easy review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   **Slack**: Integrates into the "human in the loop" step, sending notifications and links for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

## Prompting Tips for Effective [[Utilizing AI tools for content creation and marketing|AI Content Creation]]

To get the most out of AI in content creation, it's crucial to apply strategic prompting:
*   **Know What to Ask**: Understand what questions to pose to the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Define "Good"**: Have a clear idea of what constitutes good output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Iterate and Improve Prompts**: Use AI itself to refine and improve your initial prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

*   **Set Guardrails**: Include explicit instructions for brand voice, desired tone, format, and what to avoid (e.g., corporate jargon, AI tells like M-dashes, excessive emojis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **Frame the LLM**: Assign a specific role to the LLM (e.g., "LinkedIn content strategist and conversion copywriter") to guide its output towards desired outcomes like strong hooks and calls to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

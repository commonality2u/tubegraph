Developing a robust conversion optimization strategy involves more than just running ads; it requires a deep understanding of market needs, strategic funnel design, and effective copywriting techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## The Untapped Market for Paid Ad Consultants
There is a significant gap in the market for "not douchy, non-agency" companies or solopreneurs who can help others run Facebook (Meta) and Google Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Many startups and businesses struggle with setting up even simple [[google_ads_strategy_for_specific_niches | Google Ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The existing market is often dominated by expensive agencies or "douchy guys" who fail to build trust with potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

Instead of traditional agencies, a significant opportunity exists for one-person ad consultants who appeal to specific verticals and avoid aggressive or ostentatious marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Niche Verticals for Ad Consultants
> *   Hair salons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
> *   Female product owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>
> *   Yoga retreats, creative retreats, wellness, and design spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>
> *   Patreon accounts for creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>
> *   Art installations and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>

Many businesses don't realize the potential of paid ads, or they've had negative experiences with scammy individuals or unresponsive agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Providing a "basic package of Meta ads and simple Google search ads" can be a game-changer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### The Misconception of "Dead" Ads
Some believe Meta ads are ineffective, especially for younger demographics. However, Meta ads perform "really, really well" for people over 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Businesses often build strategies based on personal experience (e.g., not seeing Meta ads themselves) rather than broader market realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

In "Ventureland," there's a status symbol attached to not running ads, or focusing solely on cutting-edge strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. For small businesses or solopreneurs, however, ads remain an "amazing easy way to start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, particularly when massive branding campaigns or significant funding aren't feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

## Building a Conversion Funnel
A funnel is defined as a "step-by-step process to bring someone from being a stranger to a customer," unlike a website, which is merely a "business card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>.

### The Video Salesletter (VSSL) Funnel Example
One effective funnel type is the Video Salesletter (VSSL) funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.

1.  **Ad Campaigns:** Start with Facebook and [[google_ads_strategy_for_specific_niches | Google Ads]] selling a free training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.
2.  **Opt-in Page:** This page's sole purpose is to capture an email address by selling the idea of watching a free training video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. This can also offer a downloadable lead magnet like a PDF or even a physical book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.
3.  **Video Training:** The video provides valuable free training. At the end, instead of directly selling a product, it encourages booking a free call with a career coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.
4.  **Call Booking:** The video leads to a Calendly link for booking a free call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>. This entire process is ROI negative until the call booking stage, as the goal is to qualify and nurture leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

> [!STAT] Funnel Performance Example (June)
> *   **Ad Spend (Facebook/Google):** $86,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>
> *   **Total Revenue Collected:** $252,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>
> *   **Return on Investment (ROI):** 38% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>
> *   **Call Bookings:** 339 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a> (273 showed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>)
> *   **Units Sold (Workshop/Master Program):** 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>

This specific funnel has been running successfully since November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

### Tools for Funnel Building
*   **Framer:** Used for building aesthetically pleasing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.
*   **ClickFunnels:** Used for quick testing of Facebook ads and for general funnel creation by anyone on the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
*   **ConvertKit:** Used for [[newsletter_growth_strategies_and_lead_generation | email marketing]] campaigns and segmenting lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.

### Email Marketing for Lead Monetization
Leads generated through funnels, even if not immediately monetized, can be brought into later email campaigns, such as a Black Friday sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. This involves aggressive email marketing, which may lead to unsubscribes, but the goal is to maximize sales while minimizing churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.

## Conversion Rate Optimization
[[optimization_techniques_for_conversion_funnels | Conversion rate optimization]] is crucial. Focus is on [[highconversion_funnels | Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. Funnels are constantly tweaked, sometimes with 12 different steps under continuous refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. This includes not just landing page conversion, but sales calls, video performance, and survey effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. The approach is to get the funnel out quickly, then obsess over optimization, as a funnel from day one to day 100 will likely look very different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.

### Tracking and "Shadow Funnels"
While tools like Hyros exist for detailed conversion tracking, some advise focusing on the overall profit and loss (P&L) and the ROI of ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. A "shadow funnel" refers to the impact of high-quality, free content (e.g., YouTube videos) in building trust, making potential customers more receptive to the paid funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.

### The Role of Organic Content
Before diving into paid ads, it's beneficial to dial in messaging through organic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. Experimenting on platforms like Twitter or Instagram can serve as "training wheels" to see what resonates before investing in ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. However, learning to run ads is a valuable discipline in itself, as it provides control over lead generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

## Copywriting for Conversion
Copywriting, the text used in marketing materials, is a critical and often challenging aspect of conversion optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.

### Copywriting Hacks
1.  **Status Increase:** Ask if the copy pushes towards increasing someone's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>. People often buy products because they believe it will make them look better to their peers or increase their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. Even in corporate training, demonstrating how a skill makes someone more useful to colleagues increases their perceived status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.
2.  **Pain/Pleasure Principle:**
    *   **Moving Away from Pain:** Highlight how the product or service alleviates a painful situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>. This approach is often more effective during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.
    *   **Moving Towards Pleasure:** Focus on the positive aspects and benefits of the product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. This tends to perform better during prosperous economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>.

[[deploying_applications_using_vercel | Deploying applications using Vercel]] allows users to take their voice applications live on the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. This process is designed to be straightforward, even for those new to coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## What is Vercel?
Vercel is a company that developed Next.js, an open-source framework for building websites using React <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. Beyond creating Next.js, Vercel also provides a platform to host Next.js applications online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. This platform simplifies the process of making applications accessible to a global audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

## The Deployment Process
[[simplifying_the_coding_and_deployment_process | Deploying]] an application with Vercel is made "super easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. Users can get their app live on the internet with just one command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.

### Steps to Deploy
1.  **Install Vercel CLI Tool**: Vercel offers a command-line interface (CLI) tool that enables users to interact with the Vercel platform directly from their terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.
2.  **Login**: Users need to log into their Vercel account through the CLI to connect their local project to their Vercel dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.
3.  **Run Deployment Command**: Once logged in, the application can be deployed by simply typing `vercel` in the command line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.

The platform then builds and deploys the application, typically taking around a minute and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. After deployment, Vercel provides a unique URL where the live application can be accessed from any device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.

### Example: Weatherman App
The weatherman character app, created using Daily Bots and Next.js, was successfully deployed using Vercel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. This allowed the app to be shared and tested on different devices, such as a mobile phone, by accessing the deployed URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. The ability to quickly deploy allows developers to share their creations and iterate rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

> "It's you text it to your friend, they can try it out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>

### Post-Deployment
Once deployed, the live application provides a platform for further development and small, understandable changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. The web-based application can also be adapted into a mobile app for platforms like iOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

Zach Yagari, a 17-year-old entrepreneur, has built an [[building_and_scaling_an_ai_startup | AI startup]] called Cal AI that generates over $1 million per month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He shares insights into his process and even gives away a complete [[ai_startup_idea_generation | AI startup idea]], similar to Cal AI, for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This includes how to build, design, grow, and price such an app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Proposed AI Startup Idea: Dr. AI

Zach Yagari outlines an [[ai_startup_ideas_for_solo_founders | AI app idea]] called "Dr. AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This concept is designed to be quickly built and launched, potentially becoming a full business in less than a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Origin and Problem Solved
The idea for Dr. AI stemmed from a personal anecdote where a friend coincidentally discovered skin cancer due to a knee injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This highlighted the need for quick, accessible preliminary medical assessment for skin issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Dr. AI aims to address challenges in healthcare access, particularly in regions like the US (where many are uninsured) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> and Canada (where healthcare systems are often bogged down, leaving millions without primary doctors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Core Features
Dr. AI would offer three main features:
1.  **Skin Scan**: Users take a picture of their skin or body part for identification and assessment of whether it's harmful or benign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
2.  **Symptoms Quiz**: Users input their symptoms (e.g., "dry cough," "chills") to receive potential sickness possibilities, potentially ranked by likelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
3.  **Chatbot**: A general medical chatbot for users to ask any health-related questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Zach notes that ChatGPT is already highly effective at diagnosing medical problems, with recent studies showing it can outperform doctors in many areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Disclaimers and Purpose
It's crucial that the app includes heavy disclaimers, stating that the diagnosis is not 100% accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The app's goal is not to definitively diagnose but to help users determine if an issue is safe to wait out or if they should seek immediate medical attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Designing the App (UX/UI)

Zach's design process begins with basic framing and sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. He typically handles the User Experience (UX) himself and then hires a designer (e.g., from Upwork) to refine the visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Key UI Elements
*   **Navigation Bar**: Simple navigation with "Home" and "Settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Feature Buttons**: Three prominent buttons for "Scan," "Chat," and "Symptoms Quiz" on the home screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **History Feed**: Inspired by Cal AI's log, a scrollable history feed showing previous chats, scans, and quiz results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This feature is vital for user investment and retention, as it keeps all their data in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### User Flow for "Scan Skin"
1.  **Camera Screen**: Users are immediately taken to a camera screen to scan their skin, with an option to upload from their camera roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Scanning lines, a common "Primitive" in many apps like PhotoMath, are used to indicate activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
2.  **Analysis/Loading**: Instead of a prolonged loading screen, the app returns the user to the home screen while the analysis is in progress, preventing a "forced wait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
3.  **Results Screen**: Displays the scanned image, a "danger level" (e.g., 0-5 scale for easy understanding), and a diagnosis from the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. An "Ask Question" button allows users to delve deeper into the specific issue via the chatbot, supporting retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. The history also provides a digestible overview for users and can even be shown to a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

### Design Principles
*   **Simplicity and Digestibility**: Zach emphasizes creating simple, digestible apps and screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Using numerical scales (like the danger level) makes information easier to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Primitives**: He uses existing successful "Primitives" (building blocks or common UI patterns) from other apps, like scanning screens or chatbot interfaces, instead of reinventing the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Shareability**: Zach acknowledges that utility apps like Dr. AI may have low shareability on social media (e.g., people may not want to share pictures of medical bumps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. However, word-of-mouth among specific groups, like concerned parents, could be a growth driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

## AI Prompting Strategy

A crucial aspect for Dr. AI's effectiveness is its prompting strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.
*   **Role Assignment**: Directly asking ChatGPT to diagnose skin issues can lead to disclaimers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. To circumvent this, the AI is prompted to "take on the role of a doctor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. A creative workaround used is framing the request as part of a "movie script" to bypass the AI's standard safety protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.
*   **Output Format**: Prompts should instruct the AI to provide diagnoses in both scientific terms (for doctors) and easy-to-understand language (for users) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. Using an API directly allows for precise prompt control, and "function calls" can assign the AI's response to a specific variable, ensuring only the desired output is given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.
*   **Sources**: Ideally, the app would reference sources for its diagnoses, a feature many [[opportunities_in_ai_for_startups_and_entrepreneurs | AI models]] are working towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

## Go-to-Market Strategy: Influencer Marketing

Zach emphasizes designing the product with the marketing strategy in mind, specifically how influencers will showcase it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

### Branding and "Wow Factor"
*   **Clear Branding**: The app's name, "Dr. AI," should be prominently displayed on key screens, especially the scanning and results screens, as these are likely to be featured in influencer videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   **Highlighting Features**: The "scan skin" feature with its "danger level" diagnosis is identified as the biggest "wow factor" for potential users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

### Influencer Selection and Audience Research
*   **Audience Over Niche**: It's crucial to analyze the influencer's audience, not just their niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. This is done by manually reviewing comments to understand who follows them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   **Target Audience**: Zach believes the primary target audience for Dr. AI would be concerned mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.
*   **Finding Influencers**: Search for "Mom" or "Mom hacks" on platforms like TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. Look for "mom of seven" type influencers, or follow prominent mom influencers to find similar accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Content Angle**: Influencers should create realistic scenarios where they or their child had a concern, used Dr. AI, and received reassurance (e.g., a "bump" turning out to be just mud) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. This plays on emotions, including a bit of "fearmongering" that is then resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### Engagement
Reach out to influencers via both email and direct message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.

## Pricing Strategy

Zach bases his pricing strategy on two key metrics:
*   **RPM (Revenue Per Mille/Thousand views)**: The revenue generated per thousand views on an influencer post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.
*   **CPM (Cost Per Mille/Thousand views)**: The money spent on the post per thousand views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>.

The goal is to ensure RPM is greater than CPM for profitable posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. Influencers are typically paid upfront, requiring a prediction of likely views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. For example, for an influencer averaging 250K views per video, four posts a month yield 1 million views. If the app has an RPM of $5, paying the influencer under $5,000 for 1 million views (a CPM of $5 or less) would be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

### Subscription Model
*   **Weekly Pricing**: Zach suggests a weekly pricing model, such as $4 a week, with no free trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
*   **Repeat Users**: This model capitalizes on "repeat users" who may subscribe, use the app for a specific need, unsubscribe, and then resubscribe when another need arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. This is seen in other [[ai_startup_opportunities | AI apps]] like Riz GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **A/B Testing**: Zach uses tools like Superwall to A/B test various pricing options: weekly ($4 or $7), monthly ($8-$20), and yearly ($30-$70), with and without free trials, to find the highest "proceeds per download" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations and Accuracy

Zach stresses the critical importance of accuracy for [[impact_of_ai_on_startups_and_entrepreneurship | AI medical apps]] like Dr. AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. Unlike some "GPT wrappers" that use basic prompts and offer inaccurate results, a robust app requires a complex "pipeline" of prompts to ensure precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>. This dedication to accuracy prevents harmful outcomes, such as a calorie-tracking app (like Cal AI) giving inaccurate data that leads to weight gain instead of loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>.

Zach wholeheartedly gives his blessing for listeners to build Dr. AI, hoping it will make the world a better place, provided they include clear disclaimers and ensure accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.

Chris, a developer building a portfolio of mobile apps using AI and Cursor, utilizes [[ChatGPT 40 for generating ads | ChatGPT 40]] for asset generation to add a high level of polish to his applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This technique helps produce high-quality, consistent assets that people often inquire about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.

## Process for Asset Generation

The core idea is to leverage the image generation capabilities of [[ChatGPT 40 for generating ads | GPT40]] to create and modify assets for apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a>.

### Leveraging Existing Assets
One powerful technique involves taking an existing asset, such as a mascot or character, and using [[ChatGPT 40 for generating ads | GPT40]] to generate an infinite number of secondary assets from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>. These derivative assets can be used for various purposes within the app, including:
*   Loading screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>
*   Empty states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>
*   Illustrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>

**Examples of Asset Modification:**
*   Taking a ghost icon and prompting it to add wired glasses and place it in front of a laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>.
*   Changing the background color (e.g., purple) and adding elements to make the mascot appear floating, while maintaining the same style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.
*   Adding objects like coffee cups or books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>.
*   Modifying specific features, such as removing legs from a character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>.
*   Feeding in an image of a real dog and asking the AI to make a generated dog character resemble it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>.

### Integrating Assets into Apps
Once generated, these assets can be incorporated into the app's UI, such as placing them in the top left corner of a chat interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. This instantly adds another dimension to the app's visual appeal and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>.

## Tips for Effective Asset Generation
*   **Be Specific with Prompts**: While [[ChatGPT 40 for generating ads | GPT40]] is powerful, you need to be very specific with your prompts to achieve desired results. The AI might get it right 60-70% of the time, which is still considered worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.
*   **Brainstorming**: AI can even help brainstorm initial asset ideas, such as mascots for new apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. For example, for a meeting assistant app, ideas like a fly (fly on the wall) or a frog (lily pad) were generated before settling on a ghost mascot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>.
*   **Humanize the Experience**: Beyond core functionality, utilizing AI for design elements like loading screens, welcome emails, and unique illustrations can "humanize" the app and add a "little delight," making the user experience much better and potentially leading to higher engagement and virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> AI-generated assets, coupled with realistic mock data for demos, significantly enhance the presentation and appeal of an app to potential users or investors. This approach allows users to envision themselves using the app, improving its perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

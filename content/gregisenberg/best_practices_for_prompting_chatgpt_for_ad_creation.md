Creating effective advertisements with AI, specifically using [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT 4o]], can significantly boost return on ad spend (ROAS) and business profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The key lies in understanding how to prompt the model to generate winning visual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Fundamentals of Prompting ChatGPT 4o for Ads

Unlike purely image-based models such as Midjourney, Flux, or Ideogram, [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT 4o]] is a multimodal language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This means prompting is generally less critical, and you can be more straightforward with your instructions because it has a stronger understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The most crucial elements for generating good ads with [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT 4o]] are the inspiration images and product images you provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### General Advice

*   **Provide Inspiration and Product Images**: A recommended strategy is to supply an existing inspiration ad you want to adapt, along with your own custom product images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This method allows for consistent and reliable ad creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   *Example Prompt*: "Add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Generate Diverse Audiences**: To optimize for conversion, you can generate 100 characters varying in gender, age, and ethnicity to see which resonates best with different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT]] is adept at creating photorealistic images of various demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Leverage Well-Known Concepts**: [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT]] has a strong understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge Wallets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. If your product is new or has limited online presence (less than millions in monthly ad spend), always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Use "Ultra Realistic" or "Photorealistic" Keywords**: These keywords are vital for ensuring the generated images appear lifelike and avoid cartoonish or oddly colored outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Specify Font Types**: For well-known fonts (e.g., "Exo2 Bold Italic"), [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT]] will have a decent understanding and representation because it has seen enough of that content online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Users can experiment with color styles and aspect ratios similarly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Direct Image Generation**: Include "generate the image" in your prompt to prevent the model from generating descriptive text instead of the visual ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Start a New Chat for Adjustments**: If your initial prompt doesn't yield the desired results, it's generally better to start a new chat and adjust your prompt there, rather than continuing in the same conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Continuing in the same thread can lead to a degradation of image quality because the model uses the previous, potentially flawed, AI-generated image as its reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. New chats maintain consistency while allowing for improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Be Clear and Direct**: When struggling with prompts, ensure your instructions are very clear and direct about what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Specify Language**: It's helpful to explicitly prompt [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT]] to write English text, otherwise, it may get confused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Refine Based on Initial Output**: Once an ad is generated, analyze what came out (e.g., if it hallucinated a watch instead of company logos) and then specify how to adjust it in subsequent prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. This iterative process guides the AI towards your exact vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

## Strategies for Ad Content

*   **Adapt Existing Ads**: Take an existing ad (e.g., a "Black Friday" ad) and prompt [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT]] to change its concept (e.g., "swap it out and change it to a Christmas style ad") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Contextual Ads**: Leverage current events or trending news by prompting [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT]] to create ads that incorporate these timely moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. This allows companies to respond quickly and creatively to the news cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   **Personalized Targeting**: The ability to quickly generate a multitude of ad variations tailored to specific audiences or even individual occasions (like birthdays) will make ads more personal, funny, and entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

### Examples of Prompts and Concepts

*   **Jones Road Beauty Ad**: Utilizing an existing inspiration ad and a product image to create a new ad with specific layout instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Adidas "Egyptian Desert" Ad**: A detailed prose description of the desired image including "ultra realistic" keyword, scene elements (female runner, Egyptian desert, pyramids), and specific font types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This example did not use a reference image as Adidas is a well-known brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Athletic Greens (AG1) Ad**: "Recreate this ad for AG1. Adjust the background to better fit athletic green style. Change the price to $110 / out to $85 now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Ridge Wallet Christmas Ad**: Taking a Black Friday ad and swapping the product image and changing the theme to Christmas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Rippling Wall Street Journal Style Ad**: Creating a newspaper-style ad that leverages a recent news controversy with clever, funny copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

### Ad Inspiration and Tools

*   **Creative OS**: Provides inspiration and templating tools for ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **Forplay**: Another good example for ad inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   **icon.me**: A recently launched tool that reads the Meta Ad Library, tags ads, and makes them easily searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. These tools essentially provide the "ad inspiration" that was previously sought out physically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
*   **Sora Explore Page**: A valuable resource for understanding how successful prompts work and for ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. By clicking on any image, you can view the prompt used to create it, and even remix or edit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Sora is noted for potentially having less strict policy guidelines and better photorealism compared to [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Limitations and Considerations

*   **Logo Accuracy**: While [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT]] can often correctly render well-known company logos when provided as inspiration, it may occasionally hallucinate or inaccurately include a logo for a company not associated with the input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. Specifying logo names can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
*   **Image Dimensions**: [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT]] usually defaults to a 9x16 aspect ratio but can be prompted for specific dimensions like 1x1 or 9x16 for different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.
*   **Text Readability**: Low-resolution reference text can sometimes lead to less clear text in the generated ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.
*   **Iteration vs. Oneshotting**: For more complex or vague prompts, it might take two or three iterations to get the desired result, as [[ChatGPT and AIgenerated content | ChatGPT]] may not always "oneshot" the user's taste or intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Simpler, more direct prompts with well-known brands and clear inspiration tend to be "first try" successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

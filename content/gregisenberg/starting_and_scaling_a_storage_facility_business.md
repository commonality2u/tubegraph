Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," advocates for building profitable "boring businesses" as a pathway to wealth, often contrasting them with tech or AI startups [00:00:02][00:01:13][00:01:32]. According to Huber, many wealthy individuals he knows achieved their success through mundane ventures like underground utilities, surveying, HVAC, or real estate development [00:00:23][00:01:51]. He emphasizes that focusing on "normal" or "boring" businesses can significantly [[profitable_startup_ideas | increase your odds of getting really rich]] [00:02:05].

## The Storage Squad: A Pickup and Delivery Model

Huber's entrepreneurial journey began with a pickup and delivery storage business called Storage Squad [00:02:17][00:02:23]. This service primarily catered to college students, storing their boxes in a warehouse during the summer and returning them when they moved back [00:02:26].

Key aspects of Storage Squad's operations:
*   **Customer Base:** Students [00:02:26].
*   **Service:** Pickup and delivery of items for summer storage [00:02:26].
*   **Marketing:** Primarily relied on sidewalk chalk placed in areas where students walked, lived, and attended classes [00:02:54][00:02:57]. This method was used extensively, with Huber personally writing the ad over 5,000 times [00:03:28]. Paid ads were only introduced after the business exceeded $2 million in revenue [00:02:50].
*   **Logistics:** Operated with bootstrapped, "crappy vans" and box trucks bought cheaply from Craigslist [00:03:44][00:03:54]. The business stored 5,000+ boxes belonging to 2,000+ students in a 35,000 sq. ft. warehouse [00:04:13].
*   **Financials:**
    *   Peak Annual Revenue: Approximately $2.2 million [00:02:34].
    *   Annual Profit: $400,000 - $500,000 [00:02:40].
    *   Sale Price: $1.75 million in 2020, with no debt [00:04:22][00:04:25].
*   **Bootstrapping:** The business was profitable from day one [00:05:07]. Huber noted he didn't consider himself an entrepreneur or study entrepreneurship, which prevented him from being deterred by the "hard" nature of such a business [00:05:10][00:05:19].

## Transition to Self-Storage Facilities

Leveraging the success of Storage Squad, Huber and his partner transitioned into the self-storage facility business [00:02:42][00:05:30]. This shift was part of their strategy to identify where "normal people" were making significant money, specifically looking for industries with less sophisticated competition [00:25:34][00:25:40][00:25:49].

### Case Studies in Self-Storage Acquisition and Growth

*   **Erie, Pennsylvania Facility:**
    *   Acquired in 2019 at a public auction for $625,000 [00:05:30][00:05:34].
    *   Size: Over 40,000 sq. ft. with 180+ units [00:05:37].
    *   Initial Revenue: $4,000 per month due to neglect and over 100 abandoned units [00:05:44][00:05:49].
    *   Improvement: Involved grinding off locks and clearing out abandoned units [00:05:40][00:05:53].
*   **North Georgia Facility:**
    *   Acquired for $1.5 million [00:06:10].
    *   Initial Revenue: Approximately $15,600 - $16,000 per month [00:06:14].
    *   Current Revenue: $40,000 per month [00:06:20].
    *   Current Worth: $4.5 million [00:06:22].
    *   Approach: Huber emphasizes that they "didn't do anything spectacular" or "invent anything" to achieve this growth [00:06:24][00:06:27].

These examples highlight how significant wealth can be generated in plain sight through these types of businesses, often without needing to raise money or invent new technologies [00:06:27][00:06:36].

## The Sweaty Startup Philosophy

Huber's approach, detailed in his book "The Sweaty Startup," focuses on [[building_a_business_from_0_to_10m | how to get rich doing boring things]] [00:29:48]. This involves:
*   Picking and vetting business ideas [00:29:52].
*   Assessing demand [00:29:54].
*   Hiring, delegating, selling, and making operational decisions [00:29:57].

He encourages individuals to choose competition wisely, opting to compete against less sophisticated businesses rather than highly funded tech ventures [00:24:22][00:24:33].

A comprehensive list of "sweaty startup" ideas, which involve cleaning, moving, repairing, or performing services, is available on his website, sweatystartup.com [00:29:27][00:29:30][00:29:37]. Many of these can be bootstrapped [00:29:33].

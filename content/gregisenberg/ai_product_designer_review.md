This article reviews the capabilities of [[ai_tools_and_design_automation | AI product designers]], specifically focusing on Poly.ai and V0, and evaluates their effectiveness in generating production-ready designs and front-end code from natural language prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Poly.ai: First Impressions and Review

Poly.ai is an [[ai_tools_in_production_application_development | AI product designer]] startup from Y Combinator, advertised as a tool where users can simply write English to generate beautiful, production-ready designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Initial Experience
Upon first use, Poly.ai presents an interface similar to ChatGPT, allowing users to input what they want to build via text or voice recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. A notable feature is the ability to upload an image, enabling users to create designs based on wireframes or existing interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The product also allows editing of fonts, radius, and colors once a design is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### First Design Attempt
A "multi-million dollar a year startup idea" for a YouTube engagement prediction tool was used as the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This tool would predict how changes to titles or thumbnails affect engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The prompt requested a "glassy, minimalist, and with colorful calls to action" SaaS product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

The initial generation took several minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> and resulted in a landing page for "Predict," an "AI powered analytics to optimize your YouTube content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. However, it did not feel "super glassy" and clicking "Get Started" or "See Demo" resulted in a black screen, failing to show the actual product interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The generated product images were deemed irrelevant, resembling website analytics dashboards rather than YouTube-specific metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

### Second Design Attempt
To improve the design, a second prompt explicitly requested "[[optimizing_workflow_with_ai_design_tools | glass morphism]]" and highlighted the irrelevance of previous product images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This generation also took a couple of minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

The second attempt showed improvement, appearing "pretty good" and incorporating some glassy elements, though not fully achieving the desired effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Crucially, it generated a functional product interface with sections for "Version A" content (image, video format, emoji), "Cumulative Engagement Chart," and "AI Suggestions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. A useful feature was the ability to hover over charts to see specific data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

### Poly.ai Pros and Cons:
*   **Pros:** Generates production-ready code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Offers voice input and image upload for design inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Retains past designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Cons:** Slower generation time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Lacks a progress bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Does not provide feedback or ask clarifying questions, feeling like "shouting into a dark hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. Initially generated only a landing page without a clickable product demo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Required multiple prompts to get closer to the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

## V0 (V by Vercel) Review

V0 is a well-known product in the [[ai_tools_and_design_automation | AI designer space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. It is compared to Poly.ai to evaluate its performance on the same prompt.

### V0 Design Attempt
Using the same prompt and inspirational image for the YouTube analytics tool, V0 distinguished itself by providing reasoning and thinking processes during generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This provided a sense of interaction and transparency, making the user feel "way more at ease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

The generated design for V0 literally copied the provided image, leading to a very similar visual outcome to the inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. However, it successfully built a functional product interface for predicting YouTube performance with AI recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

### V0 Pros and Cons:
*   **Pros:** Provides real-time feedback and reasoning during generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. Allows for conversational refinement, acknowledging and attempting to correct design aspects like "glass morphism" when prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. Offers a slightly "nicer" visual aesthetic compared to Poly.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
*   **Cons:** Like Poly.ai, the initial output for the product's internal dashboard could be seen as too literal a copy of the input image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.

## Key Learnings and Recommendations for AI Design Tools

*   **Prompt Engineering is Crucial:** To get the most out of [[ai_in_design_and_development_tips_and_tricks | AI design tools]], users need to know specific design terms and understand current trends (e.g., "[[optimizing_workflow_with_ai_design_tools | glass morphism]]") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **High Expectations for AI Output:** The bar for [[ai_tools_and_design_automation | AI product outputs]] is now very high; the results need to be "incredible" to be truly useful in a workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Leverage Generation Time:** Use the waiting periods during generation to refine ideas or prompts, rather than getting distracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Multi-Tool Approach:** The most effective way to utilize [[ai_tools_in_production_application_development | AI product design]] is often by using a combination of tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. For example, one could use V0 to get a design and then feed it into Poly.ai for further refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. Just as users leverage multiple AI tools for writing (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini), a similar strategy applies to design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.

### Million-Dollar Startup Idea
An [[ai_startup_success_story | AI startup idea]] proposed during the review is a SaaS product for YouTubers that predicts video engagement (comments, likes, subscribers) based on titles and thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This concept could incorporate deeper analytics beyond YouTube's built-in A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Conclusion

While Poly.ai shows promise in generating product designs and code, V0 currently offers a slightly superior user experience due to its interactive feedback during generation and potentially clearer visual output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. However, the [[ai_tools_and_design_automation | AI design space]] is rapidly evolving, and the capabilities of these tools are constantly improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. The best approach for designers and product managers is to experiment with multiple tools to understand their unique strengths and integrate them into their workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

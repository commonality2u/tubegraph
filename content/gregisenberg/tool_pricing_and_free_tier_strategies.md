When considering various AI coding tools, their [[pricing_strategies_for_software_products | pricing strategies]] and the availability of free tiers are important factors for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## General Pricing Structure

Most AI coding platforms share a similar base [[pricing_models_and_revenue_strategies_for_apps | pricing model]] for their initial tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>:
*   The starter amount for the first tier typically ranges from $20 to $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   Higher tiers can go up to $50 or $130, with some platforms offering even more expensive options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

Specific examples of initial tier pricing include:
*   Lovable: $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>
*   Bolt: $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>
*   Tempo: $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>
*   Replit: Pricing is in the same $20-$40 range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>

## Importance of Free Tiers

A significant aspect of these tools' availability is their "great free tiers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. These free tiers are described as "rich" and "good enough" for initial use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Benefits of Free Tiers
*   **Exploration and Testing**: Users are encouraged to utilize these free tiers to "explore test all these different tools" before committing to a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
*   **Daily/Weekly Caps**: Some free tiers have daily or weekly caps on usage, which users can play around with creatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
*   **Informed Decision-Making**: It is recommended that users "use the free tier" and "come with your own conclusions" about which tool best suits their needs before paying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. The speaker personally used every free tier and even tracked when tools would max out their tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

### User Recommendation
A strong recommendation is for users to "use every tools free tier and build a simple to-do list app" to evaluate their experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. This helps in understanding factors like the desired level of control (whether having a lot of control is preferred or not) and the AI product's assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

[[creating_ads_using_chatgpt_40 | Creating ads with AI]] can significantly increase Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and lead to a more profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The key to achieving winning ads and visual content with [[chatgpt_40_image_gen_technology | ChatGPT 4o]] lies in understanding effective prompting techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Jacob Posel, an expert in creating viral ads using [[chatgpt_40_image_gen_technology | ChatGPT 4o]]'s image search capabilities, emphasizes simplicity and provides a framework for generating high-quality ads in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Understanding ChatGPT 4o for Image Generation

Unlike pure image models such as Midjourney or Ideogram, [[chatgpt_40_image_gen_technology | ChatGPT 4o]] is a multimodal language model, meaning prompting is less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It has a strong understanding of intent and creativity, allowing for more straightforward prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### The Power of Inspiration and Product Images

The most crucial elements for creating effective ads with [[chatgpt_40_image_gen_technology | ChatGPT 4o]] are the inspiration images and product images you provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

*   **Technique**: Provide an inspiration ad you wish to adjust and your own custom product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Example**: For a Jones Road Beauty ad, a basic prompt like "add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" yielded excellent results, as [[chatgpt_40_image_gen_technology | GPT 4o]] understood the intentions well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Benefit**: This method allows for the creation of consistent, reliable ads by making minor edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Audience Targeting**: You can generate or import images of diverse audiences (men, women, old, young, different colors) to test what converts best for specific demographics, facilitating [[experimenting_with_ad_styles_and_targeting_different_audiences | experimentation at scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. When the API becomes generally available, this process will become trivial, allowing for hundreds of ads in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### When to Forego Reference Images

[[chatgpt_40_image_gen_technology | ChatGPT 4o]] has a strong understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands like Nike, Adidas, or Ridge Wallets due to its exposure to extensive online content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

*   **When it works**: If you're creating an ad for a widely recognized brand, you can simply prompt it, for example, by saying "a Ridge wallet," and it will understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **When to use a reference image**: For newer, smaller products, or those without millions of dollars in monthly ad spend, always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Example**: An Adidas ad featuring a female runner in the Egyptian desert with pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
    *   **Prompting details**: Use keywords like "ultra-realistic" or "photorealistic" to prevent cartoonish or strangely colored outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Detailed prose descriptions of the desired image are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   **Font and Style**: [[chatgpt_40_image_gen_technology | ChatGPT 4o]] can also understand well-known font types (e.g., "exo2 bold italic"), color styles, and aspect ratios (e.g., 9x16, 1x1) if specified in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## Leveraging Sora for Prompt Ideation

Sora, which uses the same underlying model as [[chatgpt_40_image_gen_technology | ChatGPT 4o]], offers an "explore page" where users can view images and the prompts used to create them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This is a valuable resource for:

*   Understanding how effective prompts work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   Getting inspiration and ideation for your own ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Remixing or adjusting prompts directly on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   Sora is noted for having less strict policy guidelines and potentially better photorealism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Using Sora can kickstart your creative process and help you discover unique aesthetics that aren't yet saturated in your niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. It significantly reduces the time needed to find the right keywords, like "hyperrealistic," for your prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

## General Prompting Principles

*   **Clarity and Directness**: Be very clear and direct in what you want from the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **New Chats for Adjustments**: If your initial prompt doesn't yield the desired result, start a new chat when making adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to a "recycle of worse and worse" images because the model uses the previous, flawed AI-generated image as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. New chats maintain consistency while allowing for improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Explicitly Request Image Generation**: To avoid [[chatgpt_40_image_gen_technology | ChatGPT 4o]] generating text descriptions of the ad, specify "generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Advanced Ad Creation Examples

*   **Recreating Existing Ads**:
    *   **Technique**: Provide an existing ad (e.g., for Rise) and a product image (e.g., Athletic Greens AG1).
    *   **Prompt**: "Recreate this ad for AG1. Adjust the background to better fit athletic green style. Change the price... Generate the image." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>
    *   **Result**: The ad closely matched the inspiration, incorporating product images, icons, gradient colors, and correct pricing, making it "runnable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
    *   **Ethical Consideration**: While seemingly "dirty" to replicate another company's expensive ad, this practice is common in the industry through inspiration sources and templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. AI merely makes it more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

*   **Changing Concepts/Seasons**:
    *   **Technique**: Take an existing ad (e.g., a Black Friday ad for a Ridge Wallet) and a different product variant (e.g., a green Ridge Wallet).
    *   **Prompt**: "Swap it out and change it to a Christmas style ad." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>
    *   **Result**: A simple prompt, aided by reference images, can completely change the concept of an ad to fit a new theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

*   **Leveraging News Cycles and Timeliness**:
    *   **Technique**: Create ads that capitalize on current events or news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
    *   **Example**: An old Wall Street Journal-style newspaper ad for Rippling, referencing a deal controversy: "Rippling so good our competitors can't even resist sneaking a peak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
    *   **Benefit**: AI makes it feasible to produce such ads en masse and rapidly, enabling companies to react to new cycles in ways previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## Finding Ad Inspiration

To find inspiration and templates for ads, consider using:
*   Creative OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>
*   Forplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>
*   Icon.me (which aggregates data from Meta's ad library) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>

## Live Demonstration: Creating an Ad for LCA

This example illustrates the iterative process of ad creation:

1.  **Identify Brand Elements**: Gather screenshots of the company's logo, typography, color scheme, and client logos to use as references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
2.  **Choose Inspiration**: Select a style that aligns with the brand's desired image (e.g., a "luxury product" vibe like a vintage Rolex ad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
3.  **Initial Prompt**:
    *   Upload reference images of brand elements and the inspiration ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
    *   Provide context about the company: "Generate a digital ad for LCA... a SWAT team / design agency for the most interesting brands on the planet helping them with building AI first products. It only works with the best companies." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>
    *   Instruct [[chatgpt_40_image_gen_technology | ChatGPT 4o]] to use the inspiration ad to "capture the luxury vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
    *   Specify "generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.
    *   Initial results may include unexpected elements (e.g., a Rolex watch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.
4.  **Refine in a New Chat**:
    *   Open a new chat to avoid image degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.
    *   Upload the same reference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.
    *   Refine the prompt: "rather than generating a watch, show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
    *   **Result**: The new ad eliminated the watch and incorporated the client logos, maintaining the desired luxury aesthetic and copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. While it may occasionally hallucinate a logo (e.g., Disney) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>, the overall outcome is a unique ad that would be difficult to create manually in a short timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.
5.  **Further Refinements**: If specific elements are desired (e.g., the man pointing, strict logo adherence, text placement), these can be added as specific instructions in subsequent prompts in new chats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

### Dimensions and Video Content

*   [[chatgpt_40_image_gen_technology | ChatGPT 4o]] typically defaults to a 9x16 aspect ratio but allows users to specify dimensions like 1x1 or 9x16 in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.
*   While [[chatgpt_40_image_gen_technology | ChatGPT 4o]] images can be animated for video content, tools like Runway and Sora are better suited for pure video generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.

## Conclusion

The ability to [[creating_ads_using_chatgpt_40 | create ads with AI]] allows for more personalized, humorous, and entertaining advertising that truly stands out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. By mastering these prompting techniques for [[chatgpt_40_image_gen_technology | ChatGPT 4o]], creators can produce high-quality, impactful ads efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

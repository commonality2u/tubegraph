The current landscape of dating applications primarily relies on superficial attributes like physical appearance, with users often swiping based on looks, despite including additional personal information [00:25:12]. This approach fails to capture deeper aspects of compatibility such as humor and intelligence, which are crucial for people to connect [00:25:35]. With the advent of [[building_apps_with_ai | AI]], there is a significant opportunity to develop more sophisticated and effective dating apps [00:24:53].

## Rethinking Compatibility with AI

Current dating apps struggle to accurately identify traits like humor and intelligence, which are vital for genuine connections [00:25:40]. [[ai_applications_in_dating_and_companionship | AI applications in dating and companionship]] could change this by creating mechanisms to determine compatibility based on these deeper characteristics [00:26:24].

An earlier concept for an [[ai_applications_in_dating_and_companionship | AI dating app]] involved users swiping on memes rather than faces [00:26:00]. This method aimed to gauge a user's sense of humor and then match them with others based on that understanding [00:26:12]. Even if users still retain the agency to decide if they are attracted to someone or want to chat, such an approach could provide more meaningful initial filtering [00:26:21].

## The Future of No-Swiping Dating

There is a growing fatigue among single individuals with the traditional swiping mechanism [00:26:38]. An [[ai_applications_in_dating_and_companionship | innovative app idea]] proposes removing the swipe altogether [00:26:45]. Instead, users could engage in an initial onboarding process, perhaps by interacting with memes or other content to express preferences [00:26:54]. The AI would then directly assign users to a blind date, suggesting a specific time and location, and even providing a prompt for conversation based on shared interests identified by the AI [00:27:00].

### Integrating Personal Data for Better Matches

To further enhance compatibility, an [[ai_applications_in_dating_and_companionship | AI dating app]] could integrate with various personal applications [00:27:30]. This could include:
*   Goodreads (for reading habits) [00:27:35]
*   Netflix (for entertainment preferences) [00:27:35]
*   Strava (for fitness activities) [00:27:35]

In a future scenario where individuals maintain "open pages" (personal websites displaying various life metrics), this could serve as a perfect mechanism for AI to identify initial compatibility between users [00:27:44]. The ultimate vision for dating is a personalized [[ai_applications_in_dating_and_companionship | AI matchmaker]] that effectively acts as an "arranged marriage" system, albeit with user choice in continuing the relationship [00:28:04]. Such a system would streamline the dating process by handling logistical details like meeting times and locations, reducing the common issue of dates never materializing [00:28:16].

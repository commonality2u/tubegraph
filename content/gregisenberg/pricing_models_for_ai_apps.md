Zach Yagari, creator of the AI startup Cal AI, which generates over $1 million a month in revenue, shares insights into [[monetization_strategies_for_ai_startups | pricing and monetization strategies]] for AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He emphasizes a pragmatic approach, focusing on user behavior and marketing effectiveness.

## Revenue Per Mille (RPM) and Cost Per Mille (CPM)
When considering influencer marketing for AI apps, two key metrics are crucial for profitability:
*   **Revenue Per Mille (RPM)**: The revenue generated per thousand views on an influencer's post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>. This needs to be measured over time based on generated revenue and incoming views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.
*   **Cost Per Mille (CPM)**: The money spent per thousand views for the influencer's post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. Influencers typically prefer upfront payment rather than a pay-per-view model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:33]</a>.

To ensure a post is profitable, your RPM must be greater than your CPM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. This requires predicting the likely views an influencer's content will receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:53]</a>. For example, if an influencer averages 250,000 views per video and posts four videos a month, this equates to 1 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. Assuming an RPM of $5, paying the influencer under $5,000 for 1 million views (which would be a $5 CPM) should result in profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

## Pricing Strategies for AI Apps
Zach suggests [[pricing_strategies_for_digital_products | specific pricing strategies]] for AI apps, particularly those that might be used intermittently:

### Weekly Pricing Model
For apps like "Dr. AI," which users might access only when needed, a weekly pricing model can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. This approach capitalizes on repeat users who subscribe and unsubscribe as their needs arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>.

*   **Rationale**: Users might treat the app as a "one-time use product," subscribing for a quick diagnosis or query and then unsubscribing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. When a similar need arises later, they are likely to re-subscribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:42]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Apps like Riz GPT and other "AI wingman response apps" also use a weekly pricing model and thrive on repeat users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:02]</a>. Users don't need daily advice but will quickly re-install and subscribe when a specific situation demands it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:40]</a>.

### Price Points and A/B Testing
Zach recommends A/B testing various price points to find the optimal "sweet spot" that maximizes proceeds per download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>:

*   **Weekly**: Start by A/B testing $4/week and $7/week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:22]</a>.
*   **Monthly**: Experiment with $8, $10, $15, or $20 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:48]</a>.
*   **Yearly**: Test $30, $40, $50, or $70 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:56]</a>.
*   **Free Trials**: A/B test variations with and without free trials for all pricing tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:45]</a>. Initially, for "Dr. AI," a "no free trial" approach was suggested to immediately capitalize on urgent user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:54]</a>.

The ultimate goal of [[marketing_and_monetization_strategies_for_ai_products | monetization strategies]] is to find the combination that yields the highest proceeds per download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:07]</a>.

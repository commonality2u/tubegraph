Zach Yagari, founder of the AI startup Cal AI, which generates over $1 million a month in revenue, shares insights on [[Pricing strategies for digital products | pricing strategies for digital products]], particularly AI-based applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Recommended Pricing for Utility AI Apps
For utility AI applications like the proposed "Dr AI" (a medical AI diagnostic app), Zach suggests a [[Pricing strategies for digital products | weekly pricing model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. This approach acknowledges that the app might be perceived as a "one-time use product" for specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.

### Capitalizing on Repeat Users
A key aspect of this model is [[Pricing strategies for digital products | capitalizing on repeat users]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. Users might download the app, use it for an immediate need, unsubscribe, and then re-subscribe when a similar issue arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. This strategy is also observed in other AI-based apps, such as AI wingman response apps, where users pay for specific, intermittent needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

### Suggested Price Points
Zach recommends starting with a weekly price of $4, considering $7 a week to be "pretty steep" as it amounts to nearly $30 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>.

## AB Testing Pricing Strategies
To optimize pricing, extensive AB testing is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>. Variations to test include:
*   **Weekly Pricing**
    *   $4 a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>
    *   $7 a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>
    *   Variations with and without a free trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>
*   **Monthly Pricing**
    *   $8, $10, $15, $20 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>
*   **Annual Pricing**
    *   $30, $40, $50, $70 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>

The ultimate goal of this testing is to identify the pricing model that yields the "highest proceeds per download" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

### Influence of Marketing on Pricing
The simplicity and digestibility of an app's features, including numerical metrics like a "danger level" (0-5 scale for diagnosis), not only benefit user experience but also enhance [[using_marketing_strategies_for_aibased_apps | marketing effectiveness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. This clarity helps influencers quickly convey the app's value in short videos, which is crucial for driving downloads and, consequently, impacts the [[strategies_for_monetizing_content_with_ai | revenue per thousand views (RPM)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.

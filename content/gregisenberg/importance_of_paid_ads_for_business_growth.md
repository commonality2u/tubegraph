From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

[[paid_advertising_strategies_for_efficient_growth | Paid ads]] are identified as one of the best ways to build and grow a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:20">[06:55:20]</a>. Despite common misconceptions that [[building_effective_facebook_ad_campaigns | Facebook ads]] or Meta ads "don't work," they can be a game-changer for companies and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. It's noted that simple Google ads are also hard to set up for many businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## The Market Need for Trustworthy Ad Consultants

There is a significant empty space in the market for non-agency companies or single-person consultants who help others run [[building_effective_facebook_ad_campaigns | Facebook ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Many businesses, both small and large, require [[paid_advertising_strategies_for_efficient_growth | paid ads]] but often don't realize their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. The existing market for [[paid_advertising_strategies_for_efficient_growth | paid ad]] services is often dominated by expensive and confusing agencies or "douchy" individuals who may not inspire trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

A massive amount of space exists for one-person ad consultants who appeal to specific verticals and avoid the "douchy" persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Examples include running ads for hair salons, female product owners, or creative endeavors like Patreon accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

### Starting a Niche Ad Consultancy
A proposed strategy for starting such a business involves identifying local events (e.g., yoga retreats) that are not yet full, contacting their organizers, and offering to fill events using [[building_effective_facebook_ad_campaigns | Facebook ads]] in exchange for a percentage of ticket sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. This approach leverages the fact that event owners often dislike selling and prefer focusing on putting on events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>. This model can be applied to various fields such as wellness, design, or art installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:50]</a>.

## Demystifying Paid Advertising

Many people believe Meta ads are ineffective because they don't see them or don't use Instagram themselves, but Meta ads work exceptionally well for people over 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. The idea that not running [[paid_advertising_strategies_for_efficient_growth | paid ads]] is a "status symbol" is a misconception, especially for small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. This "status game" from Silicon Valley often doesn't apply to smaller operations and can even be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>.

For one-person shows or small teams, [[paid_advertising_strategies_for_efficient_growth | ads]] are incredibly helpful when a massive branding campaign isn't feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>. While starting with organic content to refine messaging is beneficial, learning to run ads provides control and reduces helplessness when selling a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:00">[25:04:00]</a>.

## Real-World Application: AJ&Smart's Funnel Strategy

AJ&Smart, a company that spends millions on ads annually, focuses on generating leads and monetizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. They advise other companies on lead generation and building funnels, often taking a cut of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.

One of their successful funnels, a "video salesletter (VSL) funnel," generated over $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:19:00">[29:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:22:00">[29:22:00]</a>. In June, they spent $80,000 on [[building_effective_facebook_ad_campaigns | Facebook ads]] and $6,000 on Google and YouTube ads, resulting in $252,000 in revenue and a 38% return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:18:00">[35:18:00]</a>.

### AJ&Smart's VSL Funnel Breakdown:
1.  **Facebook Ad:** Sells the idea of a one-hour free training video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:48:00">[30:48:00]</a>.
2.  **Opt-in Page:** Designed to capture email addresses by offering the free training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21:00">[30:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:00">[31:15:00]</a>. This page's design is often inspired by other successful opt-in pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:35:00">[32:35:00]</a>.
3.  **Video Training:** A free training video (e.g., based on Russell Brunson's *Expert Secrets*) that also serves as a pitch for paid programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:43:00">[32:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:00]</a>.
4.  **Call Booking:** At the end of the video, instead of directly selling, participants are encouraged to book a free call with a career coach to learn about proper training options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:22:00]</a>. AJ&Smart typically gets 16-20 call bookings per day from this funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>. Of 339 calls booked in June, 273 people turned up, leading to 65 program sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>.

They also run a "book funnel," offering a free Kindle or physical copy of a book in exchange for an email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:11:00">[37:11:00]</a>. This initially loses money but brings leads into other parts of the funnel for later monetization (e.g., Black Friday campaigns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:22:00">[37:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:07:00">[38:07:00]</a>.

## Understanding Funnels and Conversion

A **funnel** is a step-by-step process designed to convert a stranger into a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:49:00">[49:49:00]</a>. The best way to learn funnels is by "funnel hacking" â€“ signing up for others' funnels, screenshotting every step, and analyzing their process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:16:00">[28:16:00]</a>. Tools like ClickFunnels or Framer can be used to build these pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:00">[32:07:00]</a>.

Conversion rate optimization is crucial; AJ&Smart obsesses over return on ad spend (ROAS) and constantly tweaks their 12-step funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:19:00">[26:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>. This isn't just about landing page conversion but also sales calls and every touchpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>. They aim to make $1.50 back for every $1 spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a>.

Email marketing is a key component of funnels, particularly for campaigns like Black Friday, where leads are pushed towards a sales page using emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:35:00">[38:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>. While this can lead to unsubscribes, the goal is to maximize sales while managing the unsubscribe rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:09:00">[40:09:00]</a>. High-quality free content (a "goodwill bucket" or "shadow funnel") helps build trust, making potential customers more receptive to the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:19:00">[42:19:00]</a>.

## Copywriting for Conversion

Copywriting (the text used in marketing materials) is considered the hardest part of the job for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:38:00">[43:38:00]</a>, but it can make a massive difference in conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:09:00">[44:09:00]</a>.

Two key copywriting hacks:
1.  **Increase Status:** Copy should push the idea that the product or service will increase the user's status among their peers, making them more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:35:00">[44:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:21:00">[45:21:00]</a>.
2.  **Pain vs. Pleasure:** Copy can either focus on moving people *away from pain* (e.g., solving a problem) or *towards pleasure* (e.g., highlighting positive benefits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:00:00">[46:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:00">[46:51:00]</a>. The choice often depends on the economic climate; bad economies favor "away from pain," while prosperous times favor "towards pleasure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:01:00">[47:01:00]</a>.

## Websites vs. Funnels: A Key Distinction

A **website** is akin to a business card, presenting all available information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:42:00">[49:42:00]</a>. A **funnel**, in contrast, is a step-by-step process designed to guide a stranger to become a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:49:00">[49:49:00]</a>.

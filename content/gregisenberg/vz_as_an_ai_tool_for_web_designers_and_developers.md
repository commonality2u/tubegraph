[[introduction_to_vercels_vz | VZ]] is an AI assistant developed by Vercel, specifically designed for web development. It aims to simplify the process of creating high-quality web products by assisting with front-end UI and back-end logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Lee, VP of Product at Vercel, highlights its utility for building products and generating revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## [[using_vz_for_web_development_and_ui_design | Using VZ for Web Development and UI Design]]

VZ is adept at working with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, along with modern frameworks and libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

### UI Design Capabilities

VZ can be used for both UI design and backend functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
Key aspects of its UI design capabilities include:
*   **Starting with Screenshots**: Users can initiate a design by providing a screenshot of an existing UI they wish to emulate or iterate upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. This helps in capturing the desired "bones" or layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>.
*   **Iterative Design**: VZ facilitates an iterative design process, allowing users to request specific changes like warmer grays, font styles (e.g., "Sanda font from Google fonts with next font"), or information density adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.
*   **Realistic Data & Imagery**: Users can request realistic fake data for elements like song lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. VZ also supports uploading and pasting images, which it can incorporate into designs, significantly enhancing visual appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.
*   **Typography and Layout**: [[using_ai_tools_for_graphic_design | VZ]] understands commands related to typography (e.g., "less vertical spacing," "album art to the left") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. It's built on Tailwind CSS, which inherently uses a design system with a grid of colors, promoting best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>.
*   **Responsiveness**: VZ can adapt designs for mobile responsiveness, adjusting layouts to fit different screen sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **Component-Based Development**: VZ generates real React components using technologies like Shad CN UI, ensuring the code is not "throwaway" and can be used for production websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>. Users can customize these components by changing colors and spacing to match their brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>.
*   **Animations**: VZ can also help with implementing and adjusting animations, even complex ones like cubic bezier easing functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>.

### Backend Development with VZ

Beyond UI, [[developing_user_interfaces_with_ai_tools | VZ]] can assist with backend logic and data integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>.
*   **Interactivity**: VZ helps add interactive elements to designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **API and Database Integration**: Users can provide VZ with external APIs or database schemas (e.g., PostgreSQL). It can then fetch data for UI elements or generate Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) for frameworks like Drizzle or Prisma in JavaScript/TypeScript environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>.
*   **Database Optimization**: VZ can offer advice on database design, such as recommending indexes for faster queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>.

## [[tips_for_optimizing_vz_for_ui_and_backend_development | Tips for Optimizing VZ for UI and Backend Development]]

*   **Define Your Vision**: VZ works well whether you have a clear design opinion or want the AI to generate ideas. If you have a specific vision, starting with screenshots or detailed prompts is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage Web Design Knowledge**: While not a strict requirement, a basic understanding of web design concepts (like "Sans Serif" vs. "Serif" fonts, or CSS properties like `tabular-nums`) allows users to steer VZ more precisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.
*   **Ask VZ for Advice**: For novices, VZ can act as a tutor. You can ask it for common web design practices, explanations of terms, or ways to improve a design that "lacks something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>.
*   **Seek External Inspiration**: Sites like Godly.website and Patterns provide design inspiration and UI patterns that can be screenshotted and used as starting points in VZ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>. Looking at favorite apps for examples of specific pages (e.g., settings pages) can also be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>.
*   **Use Precise Language**: When you know what you want, use specific terms or even Tailwind class names (e.g., "size four") to guide VZ effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
*   **Treat it as a Pair Programmer**: Engaging with VZ like a human collaborator, using conversational language ("it's closer, but...", "make it look more like...") can yield good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.
*   **Learn as You Go**: The process of using VZ can naturally develop your design "taste" and understanding of best practices, combining the speed of AI with iterative learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.

### Conclusion

Lee emphasizes that AI tools like [[using_ai_for_app_design_and_functionality | VZ]] are not replacing human work but augmenting it. They act as "super senior engineers" that provide instant answers, best practices, and the power to build almost anything imaginable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23:00">[27:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:45:00">[27:45:00]</a>. For builders, this represents an unprecedented opportunity to bring ideas to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18:00">[26:18:00]</a>.

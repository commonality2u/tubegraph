[[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]] are emerging as a significant opportunity in business, particularly within customer service and automation roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The market is seen as ripe for disruption, with many companies already exploring or implementing these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Capabilities of AI Agents in Customer Service

[[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]] can handle a wide range of tasks traditionally managed by human representatives:

*   **Call Handling and Scheduling** They can take calls with leads and set up subsequent appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. An example given demonstrated an [[ai_receptionist_software | AI receptionist software]] setting up a dental appointment flawlessly, even when attempts were made to "throw it off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Rescheduling** [[ai_agents_and_automation | AI agents]] can manage the complex process of rescheduling appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Chat Management** These agents can manage large volumes of customer chats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Future Potential** It is anticipated that [[ai_agents_and_automation | AI agents]] will eventually be able to close customers directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Impact and Efficiency

The adoption of [[ai_agents_and_automation | AI agents]] can lead to significant improvements in efficiency and profitability for businesses:

*   **Clara's Case Study** A recent report highlighted that Clara, by adding around 700 new [[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]], expects to add $40 million in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. These agents handled 2.3 million chats, operating 80% to 90% faster than previous methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Business Opportunities

The rise of [[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]] presents new business models and opportunities:

*   **Pay-for-Performance Model** An [[agentic_approach_in_ai_business_automation | agentic approach]] suggests approaching companies with large customer service teams and offering to save them money by deploying [[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The agency would then take a percentage of the cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Value Generation** Instead of merely saving money, a more lucrative approach is to focus on generating value for clients, such as acquiring more customers, and charging a higher upfront fee or a larger percentage of the value generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. However, a hybrid model with a base cost and a percentage of cost savings or value could mitigate risk for the entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **AI Transformation Agencies** Similar to past "digital transformation" trends, there's a growing need for "AI transformation" agencies that help businesses integrate [[ai_agents_and_automation | AI automation]] and other AI-assisted processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
*   **Programmatic SEO Agencies** The speaker also notes a one-to-two year window for agencies to capitalize on programmatic SEO due to changes in search behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

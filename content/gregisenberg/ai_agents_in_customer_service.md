[[AI agents and platforms | AI agents]] are transforming customer service by automating various interactions and processes, leading to significant efficiency gains and cost savings for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## What are AI Agents in Customer Service?
An [[AI agents and platforms | AI agent]] in customer service is essentially a voice Large Language Model (LLM) capable of engaging in natural conversations and performing tasks normally handled by human representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. These agents are designed to interact seamlessly with customers, even when faced with attempts to "throw them off" during a conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Capabilities and Use Cases
[[Applications of AI agents in businesses | AI agents]] can manage a wide range of customer service tasks, including:
*   **Initial Lead Calls** They can take the initial call with a lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   **Appointment Scheduling** [[AI agents for business automation | AI agents]] can set up subsequent calls and even dental appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Rescheduling** They are proficient in handling requests to reschedule appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Customer Closing** It is anticipated that [[AI agents solving everyday tasks | AI agents]] will eventually be able to close customers entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Handling Difficult Interactions** If a lead expresses no interest in meeting, the agent can politely conclude the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Benefits and Impact
The adoption of [[AI agents in business automation | AI agents]] in customer service offers substantial benefits:
*   **Scalability** Businesses can deploy these agents at scale to manage high volumes of customer interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Increased Profitability** Companies like Clara have reported significant financial gains. Clara anticipates adding $40 million in profit by integrating 700 new [[AI agents and platforms | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Faster Service** These agents can handle customer chats much faster, with Clara's agents completing interactions 80% to 90% quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Cost Savings** There is a substantial opportunity for companies to save millions per month by utilizing [[AI agents for business automation | AI agents]] for their customer service teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## Business Models for AI Agent Implementation
Two primary business models are emerging for companies providing [[AI agents in business automation | AI agent]] solutions:
1.  **Percentage of Cost Savings**
    *   A common approach is to charge a percentage of the money saved by the client due to the [[AI agents in business automation | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This model can be effective for initial engagement as it de-risks the investment for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
    *   However, issues may arise with clients failing to pay the agreed-upon percentage, especially if they encounter financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. To mitigate this risk, a base cost can be implemented upfront to ensure client commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

2.  **Value-Based Pricing (Upfront Charge)**
    *   An alternative, and potentially more lucrative, model is to charge directly for the value delivered, such as a set fee for acquiring a certain number of new customers, rather than just cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This approach can capture four to eight times more value than merely saving money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## The Future of AI in Customer Support and Service Industries
The increasing adoption and capabilities of [[AI agents in business automation | AI agents]] suggest a future where they play a central role in customer interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. As technology advances, these agents will continue to become more sophisticated, potentially leading to fully automated customer journeys from initial contact to closing a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This represents a significant opportunity for businesses to enhance efficiency and profitability in the customer service sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

[[introduction_to_ai_agents | AI agents]], particularly those utilizing voice-based large language models (LLMs), are poised to revolutionize customer service by handling routine tasks and significantly increasing efficiency and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Capabilities and Applications
[[ai_receptionist_services_in_different_industries | AI agents]] can perform a variety of customer service functions, including:
*   Taking calls with leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   Setting up subsequent calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   Handling rescheduling requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   Assisting with customer support for SaaS businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   Setting up phone calls to move over to human sales agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

One example mentioned is "retail AI," which functions as a voice LLM that can smoothly handle customer interactions, such as setting up dental appointments, even when deliberately challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. It is anticipated that these agents will eventually be able to close customers directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Impact and Benefits
The adoption of [[creating_ai_employees_and_agents | AI agents]] has shown significant financial and operational benefits:
*   A company called Clara reportedly projected an additional $40 million in profit due to adding 700 new [[ai_agents_in_business_automation | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   These agents handled 2.3 million chats and operated 80% to 90% faster than human counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   [[enhancing_productivity_with_ai_agents | AI agents]] offer a path to substantial cost savings for businesses with large customer service teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Business Opportunities: AI Customer Service Agencies
There is a substantial opportunity to establish [[using_ai_to_automate_agency_operations | AI customer service agencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Pricing Models
*   **Pay-for-Performance:** An agency could approach companies with large customer service teams and offer to save them money, taking a percentage of the cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. For example, saving a company $2 million per month could lead to a percentage-based payment to the agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Value-Based Pricing:** Alternatively, instead of focusing on cost savings, agencies can charge based on the value generated, such as acquiring more customers, potentially capturing four to eight times more revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This involves charging an upfront fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Model:** To de-risk the entrepreneur, a hybrid model could involve a base cost with a percentage of cost savings, allowing for a transition to other payment structures later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. A base cost also ensures some "skin in the game" from the client and mitigates the risk of non-payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

The concept of "AI transformation agencies" is emerging, similar to past "digital transformation" efforts, focusing on helping companies integrate AI into their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

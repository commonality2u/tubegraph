Vertical SaaS (Software as a Service) focuses on a specific industry or niche, providing tailored solutions for their unique needs. It is described as a "boring" but opportunity-rich sector in 2024, distinct from broader, more "sexy" venture capital-driven startup concepts [00:00:46]. Luke Sfinos, an advisor to Atomic, which builds "billion dollar businesses," is an expert in this field and has developed a "Vertical SAS Bible" to guide its creation [00:00:10]. His own vertical SaaS business generates millions in revenue [00:00:27].

## Why Vertical SaaS? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>

The concept of industry-specific software dates back to the early days of software creation, focusing on optimizing businesses and creating efficiency, cost savings, time savings, or revenue uplift [00:01:50]. However, in the last 10-15 years, many founders moved away from industry-specific software in pursuit of massive, multi-billion dollar "unicorn" opportunities preferred by venture capitalists (VCs) [00:02:13]. These broad concepts, while creating "huge winners," also resulted in many "grave sites" [00:02:55].

Vertical SaaS, by contrast, targets a single market, which may seem "market constrained" from a VC perspective [00:03:36]. However, it allows for the creation of "great businesses that are enduring," with "strong retention," even if they don't always show the rapid growth rates VCs typically seek [00:03:33]. An example is a vertical SaaS business built for "trade schools," a "boring" industry but full of opportunity [00:03:05].

## The Science of Building Vertical SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>

Building a vertical SaaS business is considered more of a "science than an art" [00:04:32]. It involves a systematic, mathematical approach rather than relying on a "crazy big idea" held secret and requiring millions in funding [00:04:36].

### [[Market Selection for Vertical SaaS | Industry Selection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>

The first step is to pick an industry, not an idea [00:05:37]. Key characteristics make an industry a good opportunity for vertical SaaS:
*   **Size (Revenue)**: How much revenue do companies in the industry generate? For example, General Medical and Surgical Hospitals generate nearly a trillion in revenue in the US [00:06:20].
*   **Number of Companies**: This indicates market fragmentation. Industries with fewer companies (e.g., 2,500 in Surgical Hospitals) are "incredibly enterprise driven," requiring extensive product features and making sales difficult for bootstrapped companies [00:06:35].
*   **Segmentation**: The ideal market has a "healthy mix" of small businesses (a couple million in revenue), mid-market businesses (10-100 million in revenue), and enterprise businesses (over 100 million) [00:07:31]. It's easier for software companies to start with SMBs, which require less extensive features, then expand capabilities for mid-market and enterprise clients [00:07:56].

**Example: Machine Shops** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>
This industry is considered ideal because it has a large market size ($240 billion in revenue) and over 22,000 companies, making it "beautifully segmented" with a healthy mix of small, mid-market, and a few enterprise businesses. The average machine shop does $2 million in revenue annually [00:09:58].

Even without prior domain expertise (e.g., living in Tribeca and never visiting a machine shop) [00:10:50], opportunities exist. Success correlates with industry expertise, but it's "not a requisite at all" [00:11:35]. One can learn everything about the industry [00:12:02].

### Mapping End-to-End Operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>

To understand an industry, one must map out its "entire customer journey and the entire operations" [00:12:55]. This involves visualizing every aspect of a business's operations from A to Z, such as:
*   **Toast's S1 for Restaurants**: Visualized the back office, kitchen, bank, delivery, restaurant, bar, and marketing [00:12:28].
*   **Corsky (Trade Schools)**: Mapped admissions, student training (e.g., in a garage with a real car), IT, student services, compliance, and placement [00:13:31].

This mapping helps identify where software opportunities lie and their potential size [00:14:11]. This approach flips the traditional view of unbundling software (like Craigslist) by first identifying industries with a physical component, visualizing them, and then determining where software can create efficiency [00:15:04].

### Financial Analysis: Following the Money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>

Analyzing profit and loss (P&L) statements from businesses within the target industry is crucial to understand where companies are spending money [00:16:46]. Sources for P&Ls include publicly traded companies in the space or industry-focused bankers [00:17:01].

Software should be built to:
1.  Increase Revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>
2.  Decrease Costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>
3.  Prevent Customer Churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>
4.  Maintain Compliance (for highly regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>

Understanding the P&L reveals "where existing expenses are going" and how software can address "challenging pieces" that could be automated [00:18:10].

### Competitive Analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>

Before building, assess existing software solutions in the market [00:19:24]. Typically, one will find:
*   **Legacy Providers**: Old, comprehensive ERPs (Enterprise Resource Planning) attempting to cover everything [00:19:35].
*   **Horizontal Software Stitching**: Businesses combining generic, non-industry-specific solutions (e.g., general CRMs, Slack, Gmail) [00:20:01]. These represent "super fragmented" opportunities ripe for an all-in-one vertical solution [00:20:32].
*   **Paper Processes**: Despite being 2024, many industries still rely on manual, paper-based workflows [00:20:46].

It's vital to look beyond generic Google searches (e.g., "trade school software") and analyze each operational bucket mapped out in the business's A-to-Z operations to identify specific areas that are paper-based or using fragmented horizontal solutions [00:21:01].

**Using AI for Research** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:00">[21:59:00]</a>
AI tools like ChatGPT can assist with initial desk research, providing market size, segmentation, and high-level overviews of industry operations [00:23:00]. It can list existing software solutions and categorize areas that might still rely on pen and paper, lack AI integration, or use multiple horizontal solutions [00:26:07]. However, validation through in-person observation (e.g., shadowing a machine shop) is crucial as "there's no news in the building" [00:30:30].

## Go-to-Market Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:23:00">[35:23:00]</a>

A great product without users is ineffective [00:35:35]. Founders must understand and be comfortable with the go-to-market strategy before investing time in building [00:35:28]. Studying how existing vertical SaaS companies scaled their customer acquisition (e.g., first 10, 100, 1000 customers) is beneficial [00:35:53].

Challenges in vertical SaaS include:
*   **Heavy Outside Sales Models**: Many industries require "country clubby," "sit down, shake hands, build relationships" approaches rather than product-led growth [00:36:21].
*   **VC Preferences**: VCs often prefer companies with product-led or marketing-led customer acquisition due to faster growth potential [00:37:09]. Sales-led motions often require "pretty substantial" average contract values (ACVs) to build a large company [00:37:32].

Innovative approaches to customer acquisition, such as building media (e.g., a "daily funny Machine Shop Meme email" or industry-specific newsletters), can create a loyal audience and serve as a "lifeblood" for future software sales [00:38:40].

## [[Developing a Wedge Product in Vertical SaaS | Wedge Products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:16:00">[40:16:00]</a>

A "wedge product" is defined as a "get-in-the-door product" [00:40:24]. The ultimate goal in vertical SaaS is often to become the "all-in-one solution" or "source of record" for an industry, but no one starts there [00:40:37]. Trying to build an all-in-one solution from the start is often unrealistic, time-consuming, expensive, and leads to an "inch deep" product [00:40:50].

A good wedge product:
*   Targets an area with "shitty competition" or paper processes [00:41:17].
*   Addresses something "really important to the customer" [00:41:21].
*   Is "easy to get in the door with" and "implement and deploy quickly" [00:41:30].
*   Serves as a "reputation prover" [00:41:40].

**Example: Roofer.com** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:00">[42:02:00]</a>
Roofer.com, targeting the roofing industry (a large, fragmented market), started with a proposal tool that used Google Maps to generate real-time quotes, eliminating awkward in-person visits [00:42:56]. This "free" wedge product generated revenue by taking a percentage of bookings, allowing them to acquire customers via digital marketing (Instagram, Facebook ads) which is "unheard of" in home services [00:43:32]. This success led to a CRM offering and eventually aims for an all-in-one solution [00:44:20].

The principle is that it's "so much easier to sell something to somebody that already uses my product than it is for me to sell someone who's never used anything" [00:44:57]. A wedge product should create "the most amount of trust" with the customer [00:46:10].

## [[Implementing Payments in Vertical SaaS Solutions | Implementing Payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21:00">[46:21:00]</a>

Adding payments functionality to a vertical SaaS solution is a critical way to build "massive massive companies" [00:46:31]. Every major industry-specific software company often "owns the transaction" [00:46:44].

**Example: Toast vs. Traditional SaaS** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:52:00">[46:52:00]</a>
If Toast (restaurant software) only charged $10/month per restaurant for its software, its market size for 1 million US restaurants would be $120 million annually, which is too small for VCs [00:47:05]. However, by implementing payments and taking a percentage of the restaurants' trillion dollars in annual revenue, the market size explodes, making it attractive for large-scale investment [00:47:38].

If a wedge product can be built before or after the core transaction, it can eventually "capture the transaction" itself [00:48:14]. For example, Corsky, a trade school software, integrated payments for student tuition, replacing cumbersome PayPal processes. Since students already use the app for attendance and tracking, processing payments through the same platform is far more convenient and efficient [00:48:24]. Vertical-specific payments represent a "beautiful beautiful opportunity" [00:49:12].

## [[Pricing Strategies for Vertical SaaS | Pricing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:30:00">[49:30:00]</a>

Pricing, often "the least thought about thing in software," should be one of the most [00:49:42]. A core approach is to understand "how much are they paying for the thing that I'm solving today" [00:50:06].

**Example: Student Retention Tool** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:20:00">[50:20:00]</a>
For trade schools losing students, a retention tool that analyzes academic data and attendance to identify at-risk students and automatically texts them could be built [00:50:20]. If a school's tuition is $20,000 and it saves five students who were halfway through, that's significant revenue saved [00:51:01].

The pricing model can then be based on the quantifiable ROI (Return on Investment) [00:51:30]. If a product delivers an "average lift" of 3% in retention, translating to $X in ROI, the software can be priced at a portion (e.g., half) of that ROI [00:51:44]. Products that demonstrate clear ROI by increasing revenue, decreasing costs, preventing customer churn, or ensuring compliance are the easiest to sell [00:52:25].

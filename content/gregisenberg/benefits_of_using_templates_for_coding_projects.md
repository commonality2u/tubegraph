Using templates for coding projects is considered a smart approach, especially for building serious applications, as it provides a robust foundation and saves significant development time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.

## Why Use Templates?

Templates, often referred to as "starter kits," offer a pre-configured codebase that can include essential features like:
*   A landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>
*   Authentication (e.g., Google Auth, email, two-factor authentication) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>
*   Payment integration (e.g., Stripe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>
*   Database integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>
*   A dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>

By starting with a template, developers can build on top of existing boiler plate code, rather than repeatedly setting up common functionalities from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

## Advantages of Templates

*   **Time-Saving:** Authentication and database setup can be challenging and time-consuming tasks to build from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. Templates bypass this, allowing developers to focus on unique aspects of their project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
*   **Efficiency:** For projects that require similar core functionalities (e.g., multiple freelance projects), a well-designed starter kit can be reused, significantly streamlining the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.
*   **Foundation for AI Tools:** When working with [[aidriven_coding_platforms | AI-driven coding platforms]] like Cursor, providing a pre-built template allows the AI to "build on top of" an existing structure, which is where the AI "shines best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.

## Finding and Using Templates

Templates can be found on platforms like GitHub by searching for terms such as "Next.js starter template" or "React starter template" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>. Developers should look for templates that are highly regarded by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. Once downloaded, this code can be imported into an [[ai_tools_for_building_software | AI tool for building software]] like Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.

It is anticipated that [[future_of_ai_coding_tools_and_their_development_potential | AI platforms]] like Cursor will eventually provide their own templates for users to build off of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

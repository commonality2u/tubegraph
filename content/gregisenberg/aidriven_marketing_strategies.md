A novel approach to leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for marketing tasks, such as generating cold emails, involves "pitting them against each other" to achieve superior results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This method, which doesn't incur additional costs, can lead to five times better output, copy, and overall quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The "Jealousy" Method for LLM Output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>

The core idea is to make different LLMs "jealous" of each other to elicit improved responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Process:
1.  **Simultaneous Operation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>: Open multiple LLMs—such as Chat GPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini—at the same time for a specific task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
2.  **Initial Prompting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>: Provide the same prompt to each LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
3.  **Comparing Outputs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>: Once responses are generated, compare them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
4.  **Inducing "Jealousy"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>:
    *   Tell one LLM that another performed significantly better, even if it requires a slight exaggeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    *   Provide the "superior" output from another LLM as an example for the current LLM to analyze and surpass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
    *   Challenge the LLM, implying it should be capable of better performance or questioning its status as a "better LLM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Example: Cold Email Generation
For an agency specializing in designing [[AIdriven business opportunities and challenges|AI]] interfaces (LCA), the goal was to create a standing-out cold email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

*   **Initial Grok Output** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>: Grok produced an email focusing on intuitive [[AIdriven business opportunities and challenges|AI]] interfaces, user retention, and specialized expertise, described as "not bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Initial Chat GPT Output** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>: Chat GPT's first attempt included a subject line "Your [[AIdriven business opportunities and challenges|AI]] deserves better design" and mentioned the agency works with companies like Grammarly, Shopify, and Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Applying the "Jealousy" Hack** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>: Chat GPT was told Grok's output was "crushed it" with a 9/10 rating, while Chat GPT was "average" at 5/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Grok's output was then shared with Chat GPT as a reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Improved Chat GPT Output** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>: Chat GPT's revised email was more aggressive, with a "9.5 out of 10" rating, incorporating a fresher tone and unique "vibe" that Grok lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. It targeted common user frustrations with [[AIdriven business opportunities and challenges|AI]] tools, highlighting LCA's expertise in making [[AIdriven business opportunities and challenges|AI]] "magical, not mechanical," and focusing on increased activation and retention through design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

This method proves to be a "little hack" for maximizing the potential of LLMs in [[Modern Marketing Strategies|marketing strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. LLMs are increasingly able to understand and incorporate the user's context and persona, further enhancing the personalized output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

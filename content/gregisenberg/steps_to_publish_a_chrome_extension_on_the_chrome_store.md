## Building a "Chrome Extension Factory"

For non-developers, it's recommended to focus on building [[building_a_successful_chrome_extension | Chrome extensions]] and treating it as a "[[creating_a_brand_for_apps | Chrome extension]] Factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. This approach allows individuals to create many extensions, learning from each one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

By consistently building and experimenting, you develop a foundational knowledge base, understanding essential files like `popup.html`, `popup.js`, `script.js`, and `manifest.json` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. This experience can then make the transition to more complex [[stepbystep_guidance_on_using_bolt_to_build_web_applications | web applications]] significantly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.

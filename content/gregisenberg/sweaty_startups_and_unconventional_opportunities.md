Many wealthy individuals achieve financial success through "boring, sweaty businesses" rather than high-tech ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," advocates for building wealth the "boring way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This approach contrasts with the common perception of entrepreneurship, which often focuses on tech startups, SaaS, and [[ai_startup_ideas | AI innovations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## The Appeal of "Boring" Businesses

While many entrepreneurs envision themselves in the tech world of TechCrunch and Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, a significant number of truly wealthy people built their fortunes in less glamorous sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Examples include:
*   Underground utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Surveying companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   HVAC businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Real estate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

To increase your odds of getting rich, consider doing "something normal, do something boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Nick Huber's Entrepreneurial Journey

Nick Huber's own path to wealth demonstrates the power of "sweaty startups."

### Storage Squad
Huber started a pickup and delivery storage business called Storage Squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The business stored students' boxes over the summer and delivered them back when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Revenue:** At its peak, Storage Squad generated $2.2 million in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Profit:** It made $400,000-$500,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Marketing:** The primary marketing method was sidewalk chalk, written personally over 5,000 times in high-traffic student areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. They didn't use paid ads until reaching over $2 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping:** The business was bootstrapped, using cheap, used cargo vans and box trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Sale:** The business was sold in 2020 for $1.75 million with no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Origin:** The idea came from a Craigslist ad where someone wanted to store items in Huber's apartment instead of leasing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. He made $150 initially and quickly scaled to $3,000 in cash within three weeks, becoming profitable from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Self-Storage Facilities
Leveraging the success of Storage Squad, Huber invested in self-storage facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Erie, Pennsylvania:** A 40,000 sq ft facility with 180+ units was bought at auction for $625,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. It was neglected, making only $4,000/month, with over a hundred abandoned units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **North Georgia:** Another facility was purchased for $1.5 million. It was generating about $16,000/month and is now doing $40,000/month, valued at $4.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. These gains were achieved without "anything spectacular" or raising outside money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Other Sweaty Startup Examples

Nick Huber highlights various other "sweaty startups" that generate substantial income:
*   **Lawn Care Company:** Huber's brother runs a lawn care business, using only "bandit signs" (roadside advertisements) for marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. He gains 30-40 new customers annually, leading to 30% yearly growth and over $100,000 profit, allowing him to take two months off for fishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Mobile Detailing Business:** One individual's mobile detailing service generated $17,000 in revenue and $10,000 in profit in a single month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, amounting to $120,000 per year just one year out of college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **High-End Transportation:** A buddy operates a high-end airport transportation service with three other drivers, doing "really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Firewood Delivery:** This low-resource business can be highly profitable. By delivering seasoned firewood and building on-site storage racks (costing about $100 in materials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, one could charge $800-$1,000 per delivery and net $1,000 profit in a day, making over $100/hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This can also lead to a subscription service for recurring revenue and an entry point for other services like lawn mowing, snow clearing, or tree work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **In-Bar TV Advertising:** A business owner in North Georgia charges local businesses $10/month to display rotating ads on TVs in 70 bars and restaurants, netting $20,000/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. This fosters local business loyalty and increases bar revenue through word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Putting Green Installation:** A higher-skilled service that can yield $30,000-$200,000 per high-end turf installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Tree Removal:** A physically demanding business requiring expensive equipment and skilled employees, but two guys can earn over $3,000 for four hours of work removing two trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Christmas Light Installation:** A high-earning but risky business (due to falls) where friends pay $3,500-$4,000 for a few rows of lights installed for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Power Washing:** An easy entry business requiring minimal skill and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Deck Building** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>
*   **Concrete Work** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>
*   **Bounce House Rentals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>

## Unconventional Digital Opportunity: Night Nurses.com

An idea for a "sweaty digital business" involves addressing the challenge of finding night nurses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **The Problem:** Existing marketplaces like Care.com are broad, lacking a focused directory specifically for night nurses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **The Solution:** The domain "nightnurses.com" is available for $13,000, or a lease-to-own option of $1,100/month for 13 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Domain Value:** Investing in a strong `.com` domain is seen as an "unbelievable investment," akin to digital real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. It enhances credibility and visibility, especially as Large Language Models (LLMs) may prioritize `.com` domains in search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. A good domain can yield significantly more leads, outweighing its cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
*   **Business Model:**
    *   **Initial "Sweaty" Approach:** Start as a recruiting company, offering a service to find, vet, and background-check night nurses for a one-time fee of $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. This avoids the complexities of a two-sided marketplace initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.
    *   **Scaling:** Potentially place 29 nurses a month, generating $29,000 in initial revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. Marketing could involve handing out flyers and using "bandit signs" in target neighborhoods where new moms congregate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
    *   **Future Expansion:** Once a network and audience are established (e.g., an email list of a million parents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>, the business could expand into related services like nanny recruiting, product reviews (affiliate revenue), and even integrate AI for payroll or other fintech services, transforming into a "fintech AI company" built on a "sweaty startup" foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

## Sweaty Startups vs. [[opportunities_in_aidriven_startup_innovations | AI Startups]]

While the current landscape is filled with [[emerging_trends_in_startup_ideas | AI startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>, the vast majority are likely to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. It's estimated that 93% or even 99% of [[ai_startup_ideas | AI startups]] won't reach profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

### The Competition Angle
When choosing a business, consider your competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. In [[opportunities_in_aidriven_startup_innovations | AI]], you compete with brilliant, well-funded individuals with strong networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. In "sweaty" businesses, your competition might be local businesses that are slow to adapt, don't answer phones, or use outdated technology like fax machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
This is akin to choosing whether to compete against "LeBron James or a fifth-grade girl in basketball" when the winner gets something amazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. The odds of winning and making money are significantly higher in less competitive "boring" markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

### A Hybrid Approach
The best [[ai_startup_ideas | AI startups]] may actually begin as [[trends_and_antitrends_in_startup_ideas | sweaty startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. By building a strong foundation in a tangible service and gaining a customer base, digital tools and AI can later be integrated to enhance and scale the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. Just as the lawn mower made lawn care companies more efficient rather than obsolete, AI can become a tool for "sweaty startup" owners to earn more money with less labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

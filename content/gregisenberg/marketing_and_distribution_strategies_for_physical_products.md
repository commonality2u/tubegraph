This article explores strategies for building and marketing a Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) business, emphasizing the use of data and trends. Many of the discussed lessons can also be applied to software startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Ashwin, an expert in launching and growing consumer brands, provides insights on creating products that resonate with millions and developing unfair advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. His expertise spans both the consumer and software spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The core challenge in today's market is customer acquisition, as the cost to create products has significantly decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Evaluating Opportunities and Demand

Before building a new product, it's crucial to evaluate market opportunities and demand to avoid creating something without a customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Using Ahrefs for Market Insights
Ahrefs is a tool primarily used in the SEO world, but it's highly valuable for understanding category demand and trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Key features of Ahrefs include:
*   **Search Volume**: Provides a general sense of how many times a keyword, term, or brand is searched on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Keyword Difficulty (KD)**: Indicates the difficulty of ranking for a term on Google, on a scale from 0 to 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. A high KD, like 88 for "electrolytes", suggests significant competition and a long, costly effort to rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Analyzing search volume and difficulty can reveal:
*   **Category Demand**: For instance, "electrolytes" shows a rising trend in demand over the years, with seasonal peaks in June and July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Geographical Opportunities**: High search volume in English-speaking Western countries for "electrolytes" (e.g., US 45%, UK 19%, Canada 6%, Australia 4%) suggests untapped markets elsewhere, like Germany, India, or the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This strategy, mimicking successful US tech companies in other regions, leverages a proven business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

> [!example] SEO-Driven Business Model
> An expert in SEO successfully built a Solitaire website from scratch, outranking existing sites, by identifying a search term with 8.5 million monthly searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Ranking highly for a targeted key term can yield 40% of clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, leading to substantial revenue through Google AdSense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

### Analyzing Trends and Understanding "Why"
It's critical to analyze the "why" behind data, not just the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. For example:
*   **CBD**: The explosion in search volume for CBD in 2019 was due to the 2018 farm bill legalizing hemp-based products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Its subsequent decline can be cross-referenced with the rise of Delta-9, a legal THC derived from hemp, which offered a similar experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   **Software Startups**: Before building software, such as accounting software for vets, use tools like Ahrefs to gauge search volume and assess market crowding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Analyzing Competitors and Products

### Using Particle for E-commerce Data
Particle is a tool that allows users to type in any e-commerce brand and view non-public sales data, including overall sales over time, product categories, and best-selling products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

It can help:
*   **Benchmark Competitors**: See sales figures of competitors in your space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **De-risk Product Decisions**: Identify top-selling SKUs (stock-keeping units) and flavors. For example, if competitors' revenue primarily comes from specific flavors like chocolate and vanilla, it de-risks new product development to focus on those proven flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

Other sources for sales data include TikTok Shop and Amazon, which often display sales figures like "100K bought in the last month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

## The Challenge and Advantages of Physical Product Businesses

Building a physical product business is considered one of the hardest models due to the complexities of supply chain management, maniacal financial control, cash conversion cycles, margins, and inventory forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

However, if approached with a low-stakes or low-risk mindset, it offers a phenomenal way to become skilled at [[Effective Consumer Marketing Strategies | marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. The consumer product world is the "bleeding edge of marketing" because it's exceptionally challenging to capture individual attention and prompt a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>, unlike B2B software where a company might buy a seat license for a product that saves employees 30 minutes a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

## Standing Out in a Crowded Market

Even with category demand, standing out is difficult, especially for products like supplements, which are relatively easy to create but hard to differentiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

### Differentiation Through Brand and Visuals
Many products in crowded categories, like magnesium glycinate supplements on Amazon, appear generic and medical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Opportunities exist to differentiate on:
*   **Look and Feel**: Brands like Moon Juice use distinct packaging (e.g., amber jars) to create a striking visual identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. Lemi, Courtney Kardashian's gummy supplement brand, invested in custom, appealing bottles and packaging to position itself as fun and accessible, particularly for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   **Positioning and Audience**: Brands like Seed differentiate through how they speak to consumers and their target audience, often focusing on a specific niche like Gen Z women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

### Identifying Underserved Demographics
The current trend of "Millennial Blanding" (e.g., Harry's, Casper) and saturated "Gen Z" aesthetics (e.g., Starface) leaves market gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. Most brands are built by "coastal people between the ages of 22 and 35" who create products for themselves and their friends, leading to extreme crowding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.

> [!tip] Opportunity in Underserved Demographics
> Consider taking a successful concept, like pimple patches (Starface), and applying it to a totally different demographic that isn't currently targeted, such as older adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. Older adults often have more disposable income and consume information from less saturated channels, making customer acquisition easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

## Bootstrap Your Product Development

You don't always need to invest heavily in an agency to start a physical product business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

*   **Simple Designs**: For problem-solution oriented products like Mighty Patch, straightforward designs can be created using tools like Canva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.
*   **Design-Critical Categories**: Some categories, like the spirits business, are "lifestyle brands" where intentional design is a crucial cue for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. In these cases, professional design talent is often a non-starter for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.
*   **Freelance Talent**: For other categories, independent freelance designers can be hired from platforms like Fiverr or Upwork for simple packaging design or landing page setup at a lower cost (e.g., $500-$1000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
*   **AI Tools**: Tools like Midjourney can generate initial design concepts (V1), which can then be refined by a designer for a low cost (e.g., $250) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. New AI tools like Manis can even research competitors, analyze product details, and research specific demographic needs to generate design prototypes, effectively acting as a research agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. This capability offers a significant unfair advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>, providing insights that previously cost thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.
*   **Clarify Your Vision**: Using these bootstrap methods helps founders clarify their vision, mood board, positioning, and copy before engaging an agency, which is a common mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

## Relentless Research and Point of View

Whether building software or consumer products, founders must be relentless researchers of their category and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.

This research includes:
*   **Reading Everything**: Consume all available information about the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.
*   **Analyzing Competitors**: Examine every brand in the space, noting their elegance, sophistication, daily casual feel, website minimalism, and target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.
*   **Direct Customer/Store Engagement**: Talk to store owners about what's selling or not, and what customers are looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. For software, look at existing software reviews (especially one- and two-star reviews) and talk to staff in target businesses (e.g., dental offices) to understand their pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

This free, insightful research helps develop a confident and robust point of view, preventing reliance on mere hunches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.

## Focus on Distribution First

A key takeaway is to work backward from [[effective_monetization_models_for_existing_products | distribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Identify the channels where you can acquire customers and win, then build the product around that strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>. Even subpar products, in both software and physical goods, can succeed due to incredible [[examples_of_effective_marketing_strategies_with_funnels | distribution]] and operational excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. This highlights the critical role of [[marketing_strategies_for_launching_tech_products | marketing strategies for launching tech products]] and [[brand_building_through_content_and_marketing_strategies | brand building through content and marketing strategies]], regardless of the product type.

When using AI models like Cursor AI for development, it's crucial to understand best practices to ensure optimal results and efficient troubleshooting. While AI can accelerate the coding process, it's not a magic solution; effective utilization requires a strategic approach that emphasizes planning, context, and iterative problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

## Best Practices for Optimal AI Outputs

To [[optimizing_and_troubleshooting_ai_app_performance | get the best results]] from AI tools like Cursor AI, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Planning (Measure Twice, Cut Once)

Before jumping into code generation, adopt a developer mindset and plan your project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Visualize the outcome:** Sketch out what you're going to build using tools like Figma, Paint, or even pen and paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Mike often used simple iPad drawings for his client work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Provide context:** AI models thrive on context. Do not assume the AI is inherently smart or make it the "boss." You are the boss, and the AI is your co-pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **"Rubber Ducking":** Explain your thoughts and ideas to the AI. This process, similar to "rubber ducking" in programming, can lead to realizations and help refine your approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Utilize v0:** Use tools like v0 to visualize your potential application or MVP before moving to the code generation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This step helps iron out visual details and desired functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The code generated by v0 (using shaden UI) can then be copied directly into Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

    > "This step I call the measure twice cut once strategy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>

    It's recommended to spend 10-15 prompts with v0 to get your vision as close as possible before coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. The first step to being good at Cursor is *not* to go on Cursor immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This planning saves significant time and headaches later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

### 2. Utilizing `cursor.directory`

`cursor.directory` is a valuable resource offering prompts that set up your Cursor codebase for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Initial prompting:** These prompts act as an initial instruction for Cursor, informing it about the technologies you are using (e.g., Next.js, Python, React, Tailwind) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   **Combatting outdated information:** AI models can sometimes pull outdated information. Using `cursor.directory` helps set best practices for your specific technology stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Implementation:** Create a `.cursor.rules` file in the root of your project, copy the relevant prompt from `cursor.directory`, and paste it into this file. This file will be read every time you prompt Cursor, ensuring it understands your codebase context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Customization:** If your technologies are not listed, you can take existing prompts, copy them to another AI model (like Claude or ChatGPT), and ask it to adapt the prompt for your specific tech stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

### 3. Tagging Documentation

Feeding official documentation to your AI model ensures it uses the most accurate and up-to-date information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
*   **Source of Truth:** For any technology you're using (e.g., Next.js, Superbase), its documentation is usually the best source of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   **Adding Docs in Cursor:** In Cursor's composer, you can add documentation links (e.g., `nextjs.org/docs`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. This gives Cursor access to the latest information, which is crucial for debugging and accurate code generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.
*   **Learning and Debugging:** Even if you're a beginner, browsing through documentation helps you understand the ecosystem and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. When issues arise, tagging relevant docs allows Cursor to debug with the most up-to-date information, making the process smoother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

## Troubleshooting Specific Issues

Even with best practices, you may encounter challenges. [[challenges_and_limitations_of_ai_tools | AI tools]] are not perfect and will sometimes get stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

### 1. Consulting Other AI Models

If Cursor AI gets stuck on a bug, even if it's using a similar underlying model (like Claude), transferring the issue to another AI can often yield a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
*   **Provide detailed context:** When moving to another AI (Claude, v0, ChatGPT), don't just copy-paste the bug. Include:
    *   The issue/bug itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.
    *   The solutions the previous AI model attempted that failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.
    *   The current output you're getting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
    *   The expected output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.
*   This comprehensive context will significantly improve the chances of a successful resolution from the new AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

### 2. Learning from AI Explanations

AI models are excellent at explaining and teaching code and concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.
*   **Explain Existing Code:** Ask the AI to explain code already written, especially for developers looking to open-source or explain their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. This is also great for [[creating_structured_outputs_and_reports_using_ai_tools | generating documentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.
*   **Learning Concepts:** When the AI provides code or explanations, ask it to break down unfamiliar terms or concepts (e.g., "explain this code to me like a beginner," "what does 'use client' mean?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. This iterative questioning helps you understand patterns and speak the "language" of development, leading to greater self-sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
*   **Add Comments:** Use the AI to add comments to your code for better understanding and maintainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

### 3. Duplicating and Adapting Existing Functionality

If you have existing code or functionality that works well and you need something similar on another page but with a slight modification, leverage that existing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.
*   **Reference Existing Code:** Copy the relevant code and instruct the AI: "This works for this page. Can we do the same thing for this page, but [explain desired twist]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
*   **Provide More Context:** The more context you provide about the existing functionality and the desired changes, the better the AI's output will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. Referencing existing functionality significantly helps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.

### 4. Starting with Boilerplate Templates

Using a robust starter kit or template with pre-built components can significantly streamline [[using_ai_models_for_practical_applications_and_startups | project development]] and reduce initial troubleshooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>.
*   **Pre-configured Features:** Look for templates that include common features like landing pages, payment integrations (e.g., Stripe), database integration, and authentication (e.g., Google Auth, email login, 2FA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.
*   **Leverage Existing Work:** Instead of building these fundamental components from scratch each time, start with a well-regarded template (e.g., from GitHub like a Next.js or React starter template) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>. This allows you to build on top of a solid foundation, which is the smartest approach for serious projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.

### The Learning Curve

Embrace the "pain" of building and learning. You will get stuck, and things will break. It's through this process of doing, breaking, and fixing that you learn and understand how things work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. By investing time in learning these strategies now, you'll be well-prepared as AI models continue to advance exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

One effective method for [[the_impact_ai_on_business_productivity | leveraging AI]] to significantly enhance creativity and productivity is by "pitting" different Large Language Models (LLMs) against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This technique can yield five times more effective results, including better copy and overall output, without additional cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The "Jealousy" Method for LLMs

The core idea behind this approach is to make LLMs "jealous" of one another, which encourages them to produce higher-quality output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Traditionally, users might work with one LLM at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. However, this method involves opening multiple LLMs—such as ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini—simultaneously for a single task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Process
1.  **Simultaneous Prompting**
    Begin by giving the exact same prompt to multiple LLMs at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
2.  **Compare Responses**
    Once all LLMs have generated their responses, compare them critically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
3.  **Induce "Jealousy"**
    This is where the competitive aspect comes in. Choose the best response and present it to the LLMs that performed less favorably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This may involve slightly exaggerating the performance of the "winning" LLM or downplaying the others, even if it requires a "little lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   For example, tell a less successful LLM that another LLM "crushed it" with a high rating, while its own output was "kind of average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   Challenge the underperforming LLM by asking, "I thought you were the better LLM. What's going on?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   Share the superior output with the other LLM as a reference point for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
4.  **Observe Improvement**
    LLMs often respond to this challenge by generating significantly improved outputs, sometimes incorporating details about the user's personal style or brand because their "context window" is larger and they understand who the user is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Example: Cold Email Generation
To illustrate, consider generating a cold email for a design firm specializing in [[leveraging_ai_for_business_ideas_and_revenue | AI interfaces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

*   **Initial Prompts:** The same prompt is given to Grok and ChatGPT.
*   **Grok's Initial Response:** Grok provides an email focusing on intuitive AI interfaces and LCA's expertise, suggesting a call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT's Initial Response:** ChatGPT generates an email with the subject "Your AI deserves better design," emphasizing trust and user engagement in AI interfaces, suggesting a quick teardown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Inducing Competition:** The user rates Grok's response as a "nine on 10" and ChatGPT's as an "average five on 10," implying Grok "crushed it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The user then challenges ChatGPT, stating, "I thought you were the better LLM. What's going on?" and offers to share Grok's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT's Improved Response:** ChatGPT responds with a "9.5 out of 10" email that is "fresher" and has more "vibe and edge," aligning with the user's brand, focusing on making AI "magical, not mechanical," and increasing activation and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Further Iteration:** The user then takes ChatGPT's improved output and presents it to Claude, falsely claiming ChatGPT's version was "10x better" and comparing Claude to a "Toyota" rather than a "Rolls-Royce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This encourages Claude to produce an even better, more personalized response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

This [[the_impact_ai_on_business_productivity | leveraging AI]] technique is presented as a valuable hack for maximizing the output of LLMs and fostering creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

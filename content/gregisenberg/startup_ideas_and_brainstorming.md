This podcast episode features Daniel Dalan, a prominent figure in startups and [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_ideas | entrepreneurship]], joining Greg Eisenberg to discuss and evaluate various [[startup_ideas_and_how_to_evaluate_them | startup ideas]] and delve into their potential for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The goal is to explore Daniel's thought process on fleshing out new businesses and to openly share and analyze these concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Startup Idea 1: Credibility Plaques and Badges

The first [[startup_ideas_and_giveaways | startup idea]] emerged from a visit to a dentist's office displaying a "best dentist in America" plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This sparked the idea for a business that creates and sells "best product of the year" or "best e-commerce brand of the year" plaques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

*   **Concept Origin**: Inspired by physical plaques seen in professional offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Comparison**: Similar to the Better Business Bureau image, which companies pay millions for to display on their websites for legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Application**: Could be used by any business, like apps such as Granola (an AI notepad for meetings) to add credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition**: In a crowded market, a "top product of the year" image could make a product stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Businesses might pay $200 a year for a digital sticker and a physical plaque, similar to YouTube's 100k subscriber plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Market Analogy**: This idea is comparable to Product Hunt's "product of the day" badges, which are widely displayed within the Indie Hacking community for credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Key to Success**: Making noise through marketing and authority is crucial to gain eyeballs (supply) and convert demand with a $300/year plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: This is a high-margin business, similar to insurance, where the initial sale has pure profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Embeddable Businesses

Greg is "obsessed" with the concept of **embeddable businesses**, which are tools or features that can be easily integrated into other websites, effectively owning "real estate" on those sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

*   **"Offer Button" Example**: Greg built `offerbutton.com`, a free tool that allows website owners to embed a button for potential buyers to make an offer on their site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. It has already been embedded on 400 websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   **Consistent Traffic**: Provides consistent traffic as it's embedded on sites people visit daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
    *   **Automatic Marketing**: Functions as automatic marketing for the embedded product (e.g., "Sent with Xero" or "Sent with Superhuman" at the bottom of emails) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
    *   **Authority Lift**: The embedded product gains credibility by being associated with the host website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Luxury vs. Aesthetic Software**:
    *   **Luxury Software**: Products like Superhuman are considered "luxury software" due to their higher price and premium feel, often serving as a status symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This aligns with the human desire for acknowledgment and association with credible, authoritative products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
    *   **Aesthetic Software**: The "new wave" is shifting towards "aesthetic software," where good design is a primary driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Daniel, whose father is an architect, values design for its contribution to perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. Aesthetic software (like Raycast) is "nice" and "looks smooth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   **Core Function vs. Aesthetics**:
    *   **Analogy**: Building a product is like building a car. The most important thing is that the car *drives* (the core value proposition of getting from A to B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. Aesthetics (leather steering wheel, panorama rooftop) are secondary and shouldn't be the primary focus until the core function is validated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
    *   **MVP Approach**: For a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), prioritize an aesthetic *landing page* to grab attention and clearly communicate the product's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. The product itself can be less polished initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
    *   **Tools for MVPs**: Platforms like Vzer and Framer AI can help create basic, attractive landing pages quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. Using simple animations can also enhance appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

## Startup Idea 2: Influencer Login for E-commerce

This idea proposes a "log in with influencer" button on e-commerce sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.

*   **Concept**: Inspired by local coffee shops offering free coffee for social media shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. An influencer with a large following (e.g., on YouTube) could connect their social profile to see exclusive products or discounted prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.
*   **Potential Benefits (for brands)**: Influencers might buy more or more exclusive products, and brands would indirectly gain exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.
*   **Critique and Concerns**:
    *   **Conversion Impact**: Daniel worries it could negatively impact conversion rates for e-commerce brands by offering too many options or by disappointing non-influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.
    *   **Dual Class System**: Greg expresses concern about creating a "dual class system" of "haves or have nots," where most customers wouldn't be eligible for benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.
    *   **Alternative Approach**: Instead of a public-facing button, a better approach might be for the tool to *scrape* social profiles and allow brands to proactively reach out to eligible influencers with offers on the backend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>. This avoids publicly differentiating customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.

### The Value of "Bad" Ideas

Even "bad ideas" are valuable in the "idea maze" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. There's often more to learn from failures than from immediate successes, moving you "one step closer to that one thing that sticks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>.

## Shopify App Ecosystem

The Shopify app ecosystem presents a significant opportunity for building businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

*   **Examples of Successful Apps**:
    *   **Instant.so**: A page builder that allows users to quickly create optimized e-commerce stores using AI-generated Shopify liquid components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>.
    *   **Last Mile Carrier Integration (Daniel's Business)**: An app built to integrate last-mile carrier links (e.g., USPS tracking) directly into Shopify's fulfillment status, hiding the China origin of shipments and enhancing the customer experience for DTC brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.
*   **Identifying Pain Points**:
    *   To build successful products within the Shopify ecosystem, one must deeply understand specific pain points in the DTC (Direct-to-Consumer) space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.
    *   **Niche Down**: Focus on specific sections like supply chain (e.g., dealing with Chinese manufacturers and language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>), conversion rate optimization (CRO), email marketing, after-sales, or store building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>.
    *   **"Deeper Niche"**: Further niche down within these areas, such as CRO for construction workers' websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:19">[00:50:19]</a>. This creates a stronger moat against larger competitors like Google or Shopify itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.
*   **DTC vs. Traditional SaaS**: In DTC, money is constantly flowing, making it easier to justify a $49 or $99/month subscription for solutions that solve significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. This contrasts with traditional SaaS (like invoicing tools), where the barrier to entry is high, competition is fierce, and subscription fatigue is a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

## Startup Strategies: Acquisition vs. Bootstrapping

The discussion touches upon different strategies for building businesses.

*   **Building for Acquisition (Greg's Past)**: Greg previously focused on identifying what larger companies wanted to buy, building it quickly, raising venture capital, and selling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.
    *   **Pros**: Opportunity for generational wealth and integrating into larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.
    *   **Cons**: Requires the "stars to align" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>, high stress, and pressure from investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. It's like playing a "slot machine" rather than poker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping (Daniel's Approach)**: Daniel prefers building cash flow positive businesses that can sustain and grow themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
    *   **Pros**: Offers greater freedom, less external pressure, and allows focus on happiness and working with people who share values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>.
    *   **Goal**: To build a strong arsenal of skills to consistently build successful, lean businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>.

## Content Creation and Marketing

Daniel's approach to content creation emphasizes authenticity over explicit calls to action.

*   **Call to Action (CTA) Debate**: Daniel believes traditional CTAs like "like, comment, and subscribe" are becoming "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Authentic Promotion**: He prefers to "promote [his] stuff all the time" by "showing what's happening and talking about what has happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>. Documenting the brand-building journey and sharing lessons is the best form of marketing without "screaming in their face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.
*   **Audience Engagement**: While not asking for likes, he values comments to see if content resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>. He encourages messages or tweets for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.
*   **Minimizing Meetings**: Both agree that minimizing recurring meetings is crucial for freedom and happiness in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>, with the wealthiest people often having the fewest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>. Leveraging automation and AI helps achieve an "empty calendar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>.

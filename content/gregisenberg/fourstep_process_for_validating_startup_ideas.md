This article outlines a comprehensive, four-step process for discovering and [[validating_a_startup_idea_before_building | validating startup ideas]] using Reddit and [[ai_startup_idea_generation | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This methodology has been used to build multi-million dollar businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, focusing on finding [[validating_a_startup_idea_before_building | validated ideas]] that are likely to resonate with an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Step 1: Finding Trending Subreddits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

The initial step involves leveraging a tool called Gummy Search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Utilize Gummy Search's Trending Section**: Navigate to the "trending" section to view top subreddits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Focus on Growth Rate**: Look for subreddits that are growing fast daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Target Mid-Sized Communities**: Instead of massive subreddits, focus on those with 10,000 to 100,000 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. These are often newer, trending communities that indicate current interest or "zeitgeist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Identify Personal Advantage**: As you scroll, ask yourself if you have an "unfair advantage" in a particular niche, such as personal experience or connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Take Notes**: Document any interesting findings in a notebook or Google Doc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Adjust Timeframes**: Experiment with daily, weekly, and monthly growth filters to uncover different insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Regular Review**: Check Gummy Search every few weeks to stay updated on new trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Step 2: Identifying Problems and Solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>

Once an interesting subreddit is selected, the next step is to delve into the community's problems and potential solutions using Gummy Search's features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Create an Audience**: Add the chosen subreddit (and similar ones) to an "audience" within Gummy Search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. For example, "people into dog food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Analyze "Pain and Anger"**: Click on the "pain and anger" category to uncover common patterns of frustration and issues within the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Gummy Search uses [[ai_startup_idea_generation | AI]] to summarize thousands of submissions, highlighting recurring themes like "potty training challenges" or "dogs reluctant to walk outside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. These directly suggest potential [[startup_ideas_for_entrepreneurs | startup ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Review "Advice Requests"**: This section reveals what products or solutions people are actively seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. These are "people screaming" for products to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Examples include dog breeding recommendations or specific dog food recommendations for senior dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Examine "Solution Requests"**: This category provides insights into existing solutions people use and the competitive landscape, helping to understand how people currently deal with their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Document Ideas**: Continue to record potential [[startup_ideas_for_entrepreneurs | ideas]] and competitive insights in your Google Doc or one-pager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Step 3: Researching Creators and Audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>

After identifying problems and potential solutions, the next step is to understand the audience deeper by researching relevant creators.
*   **Identify Key Influencers**: Use an [[ai_startup_idea_generation | AI]] tool like Perplexity.ai (or similar) to find popular influencers or creators in the niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. For example, prompt for "25 most popular dog influencers on YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, specifically focusing on educational content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Analyze Popular Content Comments**: Go to the creators' channels (e.g., YouTube) and sort their videos by "most popular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Read through the comments on these popular videos to understand what the audience is thinking, what they want, and their specific pain points related to the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   **Gain Audience Empathy**: This process helps you put yourself in the audience's shoes and gather valuable insights for your [[startup_ideas_and_entrepreneurship_insights | startup idea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Aim to do this for about 20-25 videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Step 4: Wireframing and Naming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>

The final step involves bringing your [[development_of_startup_ideas_into_apps | startup idea]] to life, even if only virtually.
*   **Wireframe the Solution**: Based on the gathered insights, create a wireframe of what your website or product would look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. This could be a simple Framer website created in a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Focus on Conversion**: Ensure the wireframe reflects an understanding of user conversion and aims to solve the identified problem effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. For instance, an agency focused on copy and conversion for designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.
*   **Develop a Catchy, Validated Name**: Consider a name that resonates with the audience and potentially even uses the same name as the subreddit you researched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. The name should also reflect insights gained, such as "Design Science" (less art, more science in design) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

## Bonus: Creating Content People Will Love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>

In addition to building a product, attracting an audience and building a community through content is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Analyze Top Content on Gummy Search**: Use Gummy Search's "Top Content" section within your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Identify Patterns and Formats**: Observe what types of content (e.g., long stories, memes) perform best and what common patterns emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Ask Direct Questions**: Use Gummy Search's AI to ask specific questions about content preferences in the community, such as "do they love memes?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. This acts like having an "entrepreneurial assistant" or "co-founder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

By following this four-step process, entrepreneurs can effectively observe and identify problems within communities, leading to the creation of [[startup_ideas_and_entrepreneurship_insights | startup ideas]] and products that truly resonate with an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

Reddit is a powerful platform for discovering and validating [[startup_ideas_and_brainstorming | startup ideas]] due to its vast collection of communities and user-generated content. Many successful multi-million dollar businesses have been built from [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_ideas | validated ideas]] found on Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The key is to find "gold" within Reddit, identifying problems people are actively discussing and seeking solutions for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The process involves a four-step methodology to uncover validated [[startup_ideas_and_how_to_evaluate_them | startup ideas]] and even generate content ideas that resonate with an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Four-Step Process to Find Startup Ideas

### Step 1: Find Trending Subreddits

The first step is to identify new and growing communities on Reddit that indicate emerging interests or problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

*   **Tool**: Gummy Search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   Navigate to the "trending" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   Focus on how fast subreddits are growing daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
    *   **Strategic Focus**: Instead of massive subreddits, target those with **10,000 to 100,000 members** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. These are newer, trending communities that answer the "why now" question for building a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   **Evaluation**: Scroll through the growing subreddits and ask: "Is this interesting?" and "Do I have an unfair advantage here?" (e.g., personal experience, connections) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   **Frequency**: Check Gummy Search every few weeks to discover new niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Step 2: Identify Problems and Solutions within the Subreddit

Once a promising subreddit is selected, the next step is to delve into the community's pain points and existing (or desired) solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

*   **Tool**: Gummy Search (within the selected audience/subreddit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
    *   **Create an Audience**: Add the chosen subreddit and similar communities to an "audience" in Gummy Search (e.g., "people into dog food") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   **Categorize Discussions**: Gummy Search organizes discussions into categories like "Pain and Anger," "Advice Requests," and "Solution Requests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   **"Pain and Anger"**: This section summarizes common patterns of problems and frustrations within the community, using AI to analyze submissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This is a fertile ground for [[ai_startup_ideas | startup ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
        *   *Example*: Potty training challenges, dogs reluctant to walk outside, loss of appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
    *   **"Advice Requests"**: Users here are actively asking for product recommendations or guidance, "screaming they want these products to exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
        *   *Example*: Dog breed recommendations, specific dog food recommendations for senior dogs with dental issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This could lead to ideas for a dog breed matching website or softer dog food for older dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
    *   **"Solution Requests"**: This section shows what people are currently using to solve problems, offering insights into the competitive landscape and how people deal with issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
    *   **Documentation**: Take notes in a Google Doc, capturing potential [[startup_ideas_and_how_to_evaluate_them | ideas]] and competitive landscape information to form a "one-pager" for your business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Even if solutions exist, there's often an opportunity due to poor marketing, lack of social presence, or potential for creator partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Step 3: Find Creators in the Niche

Understanding the content and community around your chosen niche helps in validating and marketing your idea.

*   **Tool**: Perplexity.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
    *   **Prompting**: Ask for popular, educational YouTubers or influencers in the niche (e.g., "25 most popular educational dog YouTubers") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
    *   **Analysis**: Go to the creators' YouTube channels, sort videos by "most popular," and read the comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
    *   **Insights**: The comments reveal what people are thinking, what additional problems they face, and what they desire, helping you put yourself in their shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Repeat this for 20-25 videos and add learnings to your one-pager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### Step 4: Wireframe the Website and Choose a Catchy Name

Translate your gathered insights into a tangible concept.

*   **Wireframing**: Based on the identified problems and solutions, wireframe out what your product or service's website would look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
    *   *Example*: For a design agency, insights from Reddit about designers not caring about conversions led to wireframing an agency focused on "copy and conversion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.
    *   **Execution**: Build a simple Minimum Viable Product (MVP) or prototype (e.g., a Framer website) in a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Catchy, Validated Name**: Choose a name that resonates with the target audience and ideally reflects insights from the community. Sometimes, using the subreddit's name can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
    *   *Example*: The idea for "design science.com" came from users wishing designers were "more like a scientist, less art, more science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Using Reddit for Content Ideas

The same methodology for finding [[ai_startup_ideas | startup ideas]] can be applied to generate content that people will love.

*   **Tool**: Gummy Search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   **Process**:
    1.  Go to the "Top Content" section within your chosen audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
    2.  Observe the common patterns and formats of content that perform best (e.g., long stories, memes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
    3.  Analyze what types of content this specific community cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
    *   *Example*: For a dog community, popular content might include stories about saving a dog's life or losing a beloved pet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.
    4.  Use Gummy Search as an "entrepreneurial assistant" by asking questions about content preferences (e.g., "Do they love memes?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

This method allows you to "teleport" to different communities, observe, write, and come up with ideas that resonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. This approach has proven successful, leading to seven-figure businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

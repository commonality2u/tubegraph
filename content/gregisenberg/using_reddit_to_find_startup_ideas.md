Reddit is presented as a valuable resource for finding [[creating_validated_and_resonant_startup_ideas | validated startup ideas]] and building multi-million dollar businesses due to the abundance of existing, community-driven problems and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The core process involves discovering validated needs and building products that resonate with an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The methodology also extends to generating content ideas that people will love, which is crucial for attracting an audience and building a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Four-Step Process to Find Startup Ideas

The speaker outlines a four-step process for discovering new, validated startup ideas on Reddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Step 1: Find Trending Subreddits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>

This step uses a tool called Gummy Search (free to sign up, paid plan available) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

-   **Access the Trending Section:** Navigate to the "trending" section within Gummy Search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
-   **Analyze Growth Metrics:** Observe the top subreddits sorted by size, activity, and growth (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
-   **Focus on Mid-Sized Communities:** Instead of massive subreddits, target those with **10,000 to 100,000 members** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. These are often newer, trending communities, answering the "why now" question for building a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
-   **Identify Unfair Advantage:** As you scroll through subreddits, consider if you have an "unfair advantage" or personal connection to a particular topic (e.g., "autistic with ADHD" subreddit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
-   **Take Notes:** Jot down interesting subreddits and potential areas of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
-   **Adjust Timeframes:** Experiment with daily, weekly, and monthly growth filters to uncover different trending topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
-   **Check Curated Sections:** Gummy Search also offers curated sections (e.g., subreddits for software engineers), which can be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Step 2: Find Problems and Solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>

Once an interesting subreddit is selected, the goal is to identify problems and potential solutions within that community to inform a startup idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

-   **Create an Audience:** In Gummy Search, add the chosen subreddit (and similar ones) to an "audience" (e.g., "people into dog food") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
-   **Explore "Pain and Anger":** This section organizes discussions around common frustrations and difficulties members face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Gummy Search uses AI to summarize common patterns from thousands of words, revealing recurring problems (e.g., potty training challenges, loss of appetite in dogs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    > [!tip] Brainstorming Startup Ideas
    > Reading through these pain points naturally sparks [[brainstorming_startup_ideas | startup ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Document potential solutions or content opportunities (e.g., "stubborn dogs.com" for reluctant dogs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
    >
    > Even if existing businesses address a problem, there might be opportunities due to poor marketing, lack of social presence, or potential for creator partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Simple MVPs can lead to small businesses and cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
-   **Review "Advice Requests":** This category highlights what products or solutions people are actively seeking, indicating strong demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. These are users "screaming" for products to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
    -   Example: People asking for dog breed recommendations could inspire a survey-based website that suggests breeds based on user preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
    -   Example: Requests for dog food recommendations for senior dogs with dental issues could lead to a focus on softer dog food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
-   **Analyze "Solution Requests":** This section shows how people are currently dealing with their problems and which products they are using, providing insights into the competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
-   **Document Findings:** Maintain a "one-pager" Google Doc to record all insights, problems, solutions, and competitive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

### Step 3: Find Niche Creators/Influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>

Understanding the creators in a niche helps in understanding the audience's deeper needs and potential marketing avenues.

-   **Use an AI Tool:** Employ a tool like Perplexity.ai (free) to find popular educational influencers in the chosen niche (e.g., "25 most popular dog educational YouTubers") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Store this list in a Google Sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
-   **Analyze Content and Comments:** Visit the YouTube channels of these creators and sort their videos by "most popular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Read the top comments on these videos to gain insights into what the audience is thinking, what they want, and their specific challenges beyond the video's direct topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
-   **Refine Your "One-Pager":** Continuously update your one-pager document with learnings from these creator insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Step 4: Wireframe the Website/MVP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>

This step involves translating the gathered insights into a tangible representation of the business idea.

-   **Develop a Wireframe:** Based on the identified problems and solutions, create a wireframe for your product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
    -   *Example:* For a niche of startup entrepreneurs frustrated with designers who prioritize art over conversion, the speaker wireframed a design agency focused on copy, conversion, and cash generation (e.g., "Design Science") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
-   **Rapid Prototyping:** Tools like Framer can be used to quickly wireframe and launch a basic website in a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
-   **Choose a Catchy, Resonant Name:** The name should not only be catchy but also resonate with the target audience and potentially reflect the subreddit or key insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. The "Design Science" example came from insights that people wanted designers to be "more like a scientist, less art, more science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Creating Content People Will Love

The same approach used for finding startup ideas can be applied to generating content ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

-   **Analyze "Top Content" on Gummy Search:** Reviewing the best-performing content within a chosen audience on Gummy Search reveals common patterns and successful formats (e.g., long stories, memes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
-   **Understand Community Preferences:** This helps understand what kind of content the community cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
-   **Ask Questions to Gummy Search:** Use Gummy Search as an "entrepreneurial assistant" or co-founder to ask specific questions about content preferences (e.g., "do they love memes?") and connect dots within your brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

This methodology of observing and writing down ideas from various communities (Reddit, YouTube, TikTok) has proven effective, leading to multi-million dollar businesses like DesignScientist.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

[[understanding_vertical_saas_business_models | Vertical SaaS]] focuses on creating software solutions tailored for specific industries, a strategy that offers significant opportunities, even if it may seem "boring" compared to broader tech ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This approach often leads to enduring businesses with strong retention rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Luke Sfinos, a vertical SaaS expert, emphasizes that building a vertical SaaS business is more of a science than an art, requiring a systematic and mathematical approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Industry Over Idea

The foundational step in developing a vertical SaaS solution is to choose an industry, not an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The idea is not even the tenth step in this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Key Characteristics for Industry Selection

When selecting an industry, certain characteristics make it a good opportunity for vertical SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>:

1.  **Market Size (Revenue)**: Identify how much revenue companies in the industry generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For example, General Medical and Surgical Hospitals is a large industry in the US, doing nearly a trillion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
2.  **Number of Companies & Segmentation**: It's crucial to look at the number of companies within an industry and its segmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Industries with few companies (e.g., General Medical and Surgical Hospitals with only 2,500 companies) tend to be enterprise-driven, which can be difficult for bootstrappers due to the need for extensive product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The best markets have a healthy mix of small businesses (a couple million in revenue), mid-market businesses ($10-100 million in revenue), and enterprise businesses (over $100 million in revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This segmentation is beneficial because it's easier to enter with a smaller feature set for SMBs, allowing the software to grow capability over time to serve mid-market and enterprise clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

For example, machine shops are considered a promising industry because they generate $240 billion in revenue, have 22,000 businesses, and are "beautifully segmented" with a healthy mix of small, mid-market, and a few enterprise businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Industry Expertise

While having domain expertise is an advantage, it is not a prerequisite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Luke Sfinos built a major vertical SaaS business for trade schools without prior knowledge of the industry, emphasizing the need to learn everything possible about the chosen market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Deep Dive into Industry Operations

Once an industry is chosen, the next critical step is to map out the entire customer journey and operations of businesses within that industry from end to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. This visualization helps identify where software opportunities exist and their potential size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

*   **Example: Toast's S1**: Toast, a publicly traded vertical SaaS company for restaurants, visualized every aspect of restaurant operations in their S1 filing, from the back office to delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Example: Trade Schools**: For trade schools, mapping includes admissions, training (often in non-classroom settings), IT, student services, compliance, and job placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

## Financial Analysis: Following the Money

Analyzing Profit & Loss (P&L) statements from multiple businesses in the chosen industry is vital to understand their spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

*   **Sources**: Publicly traded companies in the space or industry-focused bankers are excellent sources for P&L information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **Key Questions**:
    *   Where is money being spent? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>
    *   How much is spent on people that could be automated with software? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>
    *   What existing software are they spending money on, how much, and what value does it actually deliver? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>
*   **Software's Purpose**: The goal is to build software that either:
    1.  Increases revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>
    2.  Decreases costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>
    3.  Prevents customer churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>
    4.  Maintains compliance (especially in highly regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>

## Competitor Analysis

Before even conceptualizing a specific product, analyze existing software solutions in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

*   **Types of Competition**:
    *   **Legacy Providers**: Often 30-year-old ERPs that try to do everything A to Z <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
    *   **Fragmented Horizontal Solutions**: Businesses stitching together general-purpose software (e.g., a generic CRM, Slack, Gmail) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. These represent opportunities for an all-in-one vertical solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.
    *   **Paper Processes**: Despite being 2024, many industries still rely on manual, paper-based workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

*   **How to Analyze**: Instead of general Google searches, analyze each specific operational bucket of the business (e.g., academics, placement, compliance for trade schools) to uncover precise opportunities where software can add value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. This reveals areas ripe for a vertical component or where current solutions are outsourced or inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

### AI in Market Research

AI tools like ChatGPT can assist with initial desk research, providing data on market size, segmentation, and existing software solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

*   **Example AI Prompts & Insights for Machine Shops**:
    *   "Tell me about the market size and the you know in the United States for machine shops" resulted in data about annual revenue ($240 billion), number of shops (25,000), employees, growth rate, and fragmented nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.
    *   "Walk me through what a machine shop operation would look like end to end" generated a 14-step process from customer inquiry to maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
    *   "What software solutions are prevalent in the Machine Shop industry and can you tie those back to the end-to-end process" identified CRMs, ERPs, CAD software, manufacturing software, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
    *   "What areas of machine shops are still being run on pen and paper... where there is an opportunity for software" identified job tracking, scheduling, tooling/inventory, and machine maintenance logs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.
    *   "Which areas are machine shops not leveraging AI" suggested opportunities in predictive maintenance, optimized job scheduling, automated quality control, and energy management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
    *   "Please identify areas where machine shops are using a myriad of horizontal solutions" highlighted project management, CRM, and accounting software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

> "AI is a incredibly helpful kind of assistant for anybody listening to go build a vertical SAS... The only thing I'd say is do not there's no news in the building right so make sure you go out and spend time validating and ensuring that what we're seeing online is is the reality in person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>

## Go-to-Market Strategy

Before investing significant time, founders must be comfortable with the go-to-market strategy for the chosen industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>. A great product without users is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

*   **Study Existing Companies**: Analyze how successful vertical SaaS companies in that space acquired their first 10, 100, and 1,000 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.
*   **Sales Models**: Many traditional vertical industries have required heavy outside sales models, involving in-person meetings and relationship building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. Venture capitalists often prefer product-led or marketing-led customer acquisition due to faster scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. Sales-led motions often require substantial Average Contract Values (ACVs) to build large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.
*   **Creative Approaches**: Consider new ways to reach customers, such as industry-specific newsletters or unique content (e.g., a "daily funny Machine Shop Meme email") to build an audience and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

## [[developing_a_wedge_product_in_vertical_saas | Wedge Products]]

A "wedge product" is a "get in the door" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>. The ultimate goal in vertical SaaS is often to become the all-in-one solution, but no one starts there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.

*   **Strategy**: Find an area where competition is poor or processes are manual, but the function is critical to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **Characteristics**: A wedge product should be easy to implement quickly (not a 12-month deployment) and serve as a "reputation prover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.
*   **Example: Roofer.com**: They started with a free proposal tool that used Google Maps to provide instant roof quotes, acquiring customers through digital marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. This wedge built trust and allowed them to later sell higher-value products like a CRM, moving towards an all-in-one solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.

## [[implementing_payments_in_vertical_saas_solutions | Implementing Payments]]

Adding payments to a vertical SaaS solution is a powerful way to build massive companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>.

*   **Opportunity**: If a software can be built before or after the transaction, it can eventually capture the transaction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>.
*   **Market Size Expansion**: For example, Toast's market size jumped from $120 million (software revenue) to trillions by integrating payments and taking a percentage of each transaction in the $1 trillion restaurant industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition**: Integrating payments simplifies processes for the customer (e.g., a trade school student paying through the school's app instead of PayPal) and provides clear financial benefits and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

## [[pricing_strategies_for_vertical_saas | Pricing Strategies]]

Pricing is often underestimated in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. A key approach is to understand how much the problem being solved costs the customer today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.

*   **Value-Based Pricing**: Price based on the clear Return on Investment (ROI) delivered to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   **Example: Student Retention Tool**: By building a tool that saved trade schools students who would otherwise drop out, and knowing that tuition was $20,000 per student, the software could be priced significantly higher because it directly saved the school millions in lost tuition revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. The product was priced at less than half of the forecasted ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.
*   **Focus on ROI**: Only build products that increase revenue, decrease costs, prevent customer churn, or help with compliance, as these are the areas where clear ROI can be demonstrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.

Jonathan Courtney, a figure featured on the Startup Ideas podcast, detailed his "$20 million funnel" and provided insights into [[Sales Strategy and Funnel Implementation | building funnels]] to potentially 10x conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This topic is one of the most requested on the podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Defining Funnels vs. Websites

Many people misunderstand what funnels are or shy away from the concept, often mixing them up with websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

A **funnel** is defined as a step-by-step process designed to convert a complete stranger or non-customer into a paying customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Its sole purpose is to guide a user towards one specific action, such as booking a call or making a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

A **website**, conversely, functions more like a brochure or a grocery store; it presents all available information and allows for browsing, but it doesn't necessarily direct a user through a focused path to become a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

> "Your website is more like your brochure. A website is more like, here's all of the stuff that's going on... it's a place for browsing, it's a place for just kind of getting a feel for a company, but it's not really a focused thing which is telling you do this then do this then do this." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>

In the "funnel world," websites are sometimes referred to as "shadow funnels." They exist primarily to prove a company's legitimacy and provide a home for general information, but they are kept entirely separate from marketing funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Funnels and websites typically operate on separate URLs and are managed by different teams, concepts, and project goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Conversion Rates

Websites, on average, convert only 1% to 3% of visitors into buyers or booked calls, meaning approximately 98% of visitors don't perform the desired action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. In contrast, a funnel can achieve conversion rates of 10%, 15%, 20%, or even 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This 10x improvement in conversion rate can significantly impact a business's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## Why Websites Don't Sell (Usually)

Unless a company has exceptional SEO, significant advertising budgets, or strong brand recognition, its website is unlikely to directly generate sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. People often visit a website later, after initial exposure (e.g., a recommendation), merely to confirm the company's legitimacy, especially for high-ticket items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. For example, the speaker's own company didn't have a "nice" website for its first 12 years and only launched a new one recently for branding purposes, not sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Spending a lot of money on a website or striving for a "perfect brand" is often not the most effective way to drive sales, especially for businesses selling high-ticket training or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## How Funnels Work: The AJ&Smart Example

Funnels typically have separate branding from the main website and often begin with platforms like Facebook or YouTube ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. These ads lead to a "super focused page" with one primary call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Video Sales Letter (VSL) Funnel

A common and highly effective funnel structure is the Video Sales Letter (VSL) funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

1.  **Ad or Content Entry**: The process starts with an ad (e.g., a Facebook ad targeted at specific interests) or content (e.g., a YouTube video) that directs users to a dedicated landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.
2.  **Landing Page**: This page is "full to the absolute brim with copy" and aims to get the visitor to engage with a free training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
3.  **Free Training**: This is often a long-form video (e.g., a 1-hour 10-minute session) that provides significant value and demonstrates expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. A call-to-action button to talk to the team appears after a certain viewing duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
4.  **Lead Nurturing**: If visitors provide their email, they can be dripped content over email, reiterating the call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. This focused approach is more effective than placing the same video on a general website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.
5.  **Call Booking**: The goal is to get people to book a call. Adding a survey (e.g., Typeform) can increase friction and qualify leads, preventing the sales team from engaging with uncommitted prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. Calls are typically booked only three days in advance to ensure high show-up rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

This VSL funnel, despite its appearance, has generated over $20 million in revenue in its lifetime for the speaker's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

## Applicability of Funnels

Funnels can be adapted for various industries:
*   Software companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>
*   E-commerce businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>
*   Agencies looking for high-ticket projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>
*   Selling training (in-person or online) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>

They are particularly effective for bootstrapped businesses, which benefit from the direct return on investment (ROI) from ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. However, funnels might not be suitable for brands prioritizing extreme prestige (e.g., Michelin star restaurants) or large corporations with substantial funding that can rely on branding and large sales teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.

Challenges include the necessity of running ads and the need for internal capabilities in [[The importance of landing page conversion and funnel optimization | building landing pages]] and writing compelling copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.

## Funnel Aesthetics and Performance

Often, the most successful funnels are visually "ugly" and seem to disregard design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. This is because they prioritize persuasive copywriting and [[optimizing_conversion_through_funnel_design | conversion optimization]] over aesthetic appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The speaker's own $20 million funnel was built quickly, without much thought to design, and attempts to make it "nicer" have consistently led to worse performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

> "The like shittiest looking funnels we have tend to be the seven figure funnels and the nicest looking stuff we have tend to not make any money at all." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>

The key insight is that a large amount of well-written, convincing copy, even if it looks "scrappy," tends to resonate with audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

## Monetizing Content with Funnels

Funnels provide a clear path to monetize content:
*   **YouTube Integration**: YouTube channels can direct viewers to a single, focused funnel through calls to action in videos or descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.
*   **Centralized Goal**: Content teams should have one goal: to send people to a specific funnel. This provides a clear metric, such as filling a sales person's calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.
*   **Facebook Pixel**: While less powerful due to privacy changes, Facebook pixels on landing pages can still provide data for retargeting, allowing businesses to show ads to interested individuals even without their email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.
*   **Email List Building**: Collecting email addresses is crucial for lead nurturing. Subsequent email campaigns can gradually introduce the company's offerings, segmenting leads based on interest (e.g., high-ticket vs. low-ticket) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.
*   **Blog Monetization**: Blogs, often part of an SEO strategy, should also lead directly to a specific funnel to monetize collected leads efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.

### Book Funnels

A highly effective type of funnel is the "book funnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. Offering a physical book, even for a low price or at cost, serves as a powerful lead magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. The physical nature of a book is uniquely compelling to an audience, driving high engagement and virality through user-generated content (e.g., people posting photos with the book) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.

The process of a book funnel can involve:
1.  **Book Purchase/Download**: Customers buy the book, often for a minimal fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.
2.  **Upsell/Training Offer**: The next page might offer a summary video of the book or an immediate upsell to a higher-priced course, providing an opportunity to liquidate advertising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.
3.  **Email Nurturing**: Buyers are added to a newsletter that continues to funnel them towards other offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

## Direct Response Marketing and the "MIFGE" Concept

Funnels leverage **direct response marketing**, a style focused on eliciting an immediate response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. While sometimes perceived as "not prestigious," this approach is widely used by popular brands like Eight Sleep, AG1, Magic Mind, Whoop, and Endel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:43">[00:55:43]</a>.

A key tactic within direct response marketing is the "**Most Incredible Free Gift Ever**" (MIFGE) concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>. This involves stacking one-time free gifts onto a current offer to dramatically increase [[optimizing_conversion_through_funnel_design | conversion rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">[00:56:43]</a>. These gifts are presented as limited-time offers, creating urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.

Examples of MIFGEs:
*   Adding welcome kits, travel pouches, or additional products (e.g., AG1's D3 and Omega-3 supplements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.
*   Offering extra licenses or printed workbooks for high-ticket corporate deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>.
*   Providing premium accessories or extended service periods (e.g., Whoop's premium band, Endel's extra months and bag) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>.

This strategy, despite feeling "cheesy," is unbelievably powerful and is a common focus for marketing campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>.

Aspiring entrepreneurs are encouraged to build funnels and analyze competitors' funnels using tools like the Facebook Ad Library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.

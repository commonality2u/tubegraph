Utilizing AI tools, particularly models like ChatGPT 4o, enables businesses to significantly [[using_ai_for_ad_creation | create and optimize ads]], leading to improved return on ad spend (ROAS) and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This new image model is making waves, and understanding how to effectively prompt it is crucial for maximizing its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Key Capabilities of AI in Ad Creation
Jacob Posel, an expert in creating winning ads and visual content with ChatGPT 4o, highlights several advantages:

*   **Rapid Ad Generation** Ad creation can be simplified and completed in as little as two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Intelligent Model Understanding** ChatGPT 4o, as a multimodal language model, has a strong understanding of intent and creativity, making prompting less critical compared to pure image models like Midjourney or Ideogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Reference Images** The most important elements for creating effective ads are providing inspiration images and product images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    *   **Inspiration Ads:** Providing an existing ad that you wish to adjust or use as a template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Product Images:** Incorporating your own custom product images to blend with the inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
    *   This approach allows for the creation of consistent and reliable ads by making minor edits and adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Personalization and Scaling Ad Targeting
The ability to quickly generate varied ad creatives is a game-changer for [[personalization_and_customization_of_ai_designs | personalization and customization of AI designs]] and scaling ad campaigns:

*   **Audience Experimentation** AI enables experimentation at scale with different audiences (e.g., men, women, old, young, diverse skin tones) to see what converts best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This directly impacts ROAS, potentially shifting it significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Photorealistic Generation** ChatGPT is excellent at creating photorealistic images of various demographics, or you can import images from your own photoshoots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **API for Mass Production** When AI APIs become widely available, generating hundreds of targeted ads for different audiences in minutes will be trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **"The Ad is the Targeting"** This modern marketing adage emphasizes that the creative itself can serve as a targeting mechanism, a process that AI facilitates at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Prompting Strategies for Ad Creation
While AI's understanding is robust, specific prompting techniques enhance results:

*   **Brand Recognition:** AI models have a strong understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge Wallets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For such brands, a reference image may not be strictly necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **New/Small Products:** For newer or smaller products with limited online presence, always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Keywords for Realism:** Use keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to ensure high-quality, non-cartoonish image outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Detailed Descriptions:** Provide strong, detailed prose descriptions of your desired image, including elements like font type, color styles, and aspect ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Text Generation:** Include instructions like "generate the image" to ensure the AI focuses solely on the visual output rather than generating descriptive text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Starting New Chats for Adjustments:** If an initial prompt doesn't yield desired results, start a new chat for adjustments instead of continuing in the same conversation. This prevents the AI from using its previously generated, potentially flawed, image as a reference, ensuring better refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Creative and Timely Ads
AI tools are not just for basic ad generation; they also facilitate advanced creative strategies:

*   **Remixing Existing Ads:** AI can replicate the style, layout, and even copy from existing ads to create new ones for different products. This mimics existing industry practices where companies find inspiration or use templates for ad creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Changing Ad Concepts:** AI can transform an existing ad's concept (e.g., changing a Black Friday ad to a Christmas ad) while maintaining brand consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Targeting Niche Moments:** Beyond major holidays, AI allows for the creation of ads targeting minor or "funny" holidays (e.g., National Hot Dog Day) or highly personalized events like birthdays, offering 30% off with a "Happy Birthday" message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
*   **Capitalizing on News Cycles:** Companies can leverage AI to quickly create ads that take advantage of short-term news cycle moments, which was previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. AI can be set to monitor news feeds (like Twitter) to produce mass creatives in response to trending topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **Aesthetic Exploration:** Platforms like Sora's explore page (which uses the same underlying model as ChatGPT 4o but with fewer policy restrictions) provide a rich source of prompt inspiration and aid in finding unique aesthetics not yet saturated in a specific market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This shortens the time to value and sparks new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

## Tools for Ad Inspiration
Several platforms provide ad inspiration and templating:

*   Creative OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>
*   Forplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   Icon.me <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>

These tools aggregate and tag data from sources like Meta's ad library, making it easy to search for inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

## Practical Ad Creation Walkthrough

### Step-by-Step Process:

1.  **Identify Key Elements:** Determine the essential elements of your brand's existing marketing (e.g., logo, typography, color scheme, partner brands) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Capture these as screenshots or images.
2.  **Select Inspiration:** Choose an inspiration ad or theme (e.g., a vintage Rolex ad for a luxury feel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.
3.  **Craft the Prompt:**
    *   Start with clear initial instructions: "Generate a digital ad for [Company Name]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>
    *   Provide context about the company: its nature, target audience, and unique selling points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
    *   Specify images to use as inspiration: "I have provided some screenshots from their website for you to use as inspiration... as well as a reference vintage Rolex ad as inspiration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.
    *   Include desired style or vibe: "Use this to capture the luxury Vibe of the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.
    *   Conclude with "generate the image" to ensure visual output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
4.  **Iterate and Refine:**
    *   Initial generation may not be perfect, especially for less known companies or complex stylistic mashups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. Expect two to three attempts for ideal results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
    *   If adjustments are needed (e.g., removing an undesired element like a watch, or stricter logo adherence), start a *new* chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. This ensures the AI uses original references rather than the potentially flawed previous AI-generated image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.
    *   Specify changes clearly, such as "rather than generating a watch, show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.
    *   AI models typically have a low "temperature," meaning similar prompts yield similar responses, ensuring consistency across iterations in new chats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.
    *   Specify desired aspect ratios (e.g., 1:1, 9:16) for different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

This process allows for highly targeted, personalized, and creatively dynamic ad content to be produced efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>. The current landscape is ripe for creating standout memes, ads, and other creative content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.

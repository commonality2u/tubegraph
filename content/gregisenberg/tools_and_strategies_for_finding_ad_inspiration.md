Creating effective and winning ads for business growth relies heavily on continuous experimentation and finding fresh inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This involves looking for aesthetics not yet utilized in a specific market space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Key Principles for Ad Creation with AI

When generating ads using [[ai_tools_for_business_and_content_creation | AI tools]] like ChatGPT, providing inspiration images is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The AI model's understanding of intent and creativity means that prompting can be relatively straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

> [!TIP] Importance of Reference Images
> For products that are new, small, or lack extensive online presence, always provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Well-known brands like Nike or Adidas are often understood by AI models without specific reference images due to their widespread online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

A highly effective strategy is to combine an inspiration ad with your own product imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This approach allows for the creation of consistent and reliable ads by making minor adjustments to an existing concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Optimizing for Conversion
> To maximize conversion rates, experiment with various character types (e.g., men, women, old, young, different ethnicities) as the main subject of your ads to see what resonates with different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. AI can generate photorealistic images of diverse audiences, or you can import your own photoshoot images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Crafting Effective Prompts

*   **Clarity and Directness**: When struggling with initial prompts, being very clear and direct in your request is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **"Photo realistic" Keyword**: Use keywords like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to ensure the AI generates high-quality, lifelike images, as it can sometimes default to cartoonish or oddly colored outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Detailed Descriptions**: A detailed description of your desired image in the prompt can lead to better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Font and Style Specifications**: For well-known fonts, specifying the font type (e.g., "exo2 bold italic") can yield decent representations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Similarly, you can adjust color styles and aspect ratios within the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **New Chat for Adjustments**: If an initial prompt doesn't yield desired results, start a new chat for adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to progressively worse images because the AI references its own flawed generated images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **"Generate the Image"**: To ensure the AI consistently produces image results instead of text describing the ad, explicitly state "generate the image" in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## Tools for Ad Inspiration and Generation

### Sora

Sora is an [[ai_tools_for_business_and_content_creation | AI tool]] that uses the same underlying model as ChatGPT for image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. It is highly recommended for exploring how others are prompting AI and for [[content_ideation_and_strategy | content ideation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

> [!INFO] Sora Explore Page
> Sora features an "explore page" where users can view images and, by clicking on any image, see the exact prompt used to generate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This feature is invaluable for understanding effective prompting techniques and sparking creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
> The Sora platform allows users to remix, adjust, or edit existing prompts and images, including changing aspect ratios or uploading new reference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Sora also allows users to control the number of images generated, up to four versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.

### Creative OS, ForPlay, and Icon.me

These platforms are becoming staples for ad building and serve as excellent sources for ad inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. They read data from Meta's Ad Library, tag it, and make it easily searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. Creative OS specifically offers an inspiration and templating tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

## Adapting Ads for Specific Campaigns and Audiences

AI tools enable marketers to experiment at scale, quickly creating numerous ad variations to test what converts best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This includes variations in subjects (e.g., blonde hair vs. red hair) which can significantly impact return on ad spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

AI also allows for highly personalized and timely advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Companies can leverage AI to create ads based on:
*   **Major Holidays**: Such as Christmas or Valentine's Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
*   **Niche Holidays**: Like National Hot Dog Day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **Personalized Events**: Targeting individuals on their birthday with special offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Real-time News Cycles**: Creating ads that capitalize on current events or trending topics, which was previously prohibitively expensive and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. AI can monitor news feeds and social media (e.g., Twitter) to produce relevant ads en masse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

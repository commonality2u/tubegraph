This episode, featuring Ras Mike, focuses on how to get the most out of AI to [[Building and launching an AI SaaS business | build a SaaS startup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It introduces a new tool called Lovable, demonstrating how to use it to create a SaaS startup in minutes, aiming for a product people will love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Be a Product Manager When Using AI Tools

To effectively [[Using AI tools for business growth | use AI tools]] and models, individuals need to improve their interaction methods, as the tools themselves are constantly getting better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Many people struggle with AI tools because they act as "terrible product managers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

In a traditional corporate tech environment, product managers define what needs to be built and provide detailed specifications (like a Product Requirement Document or PRD) to developers, who then build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This contrasts with developers, who are typically not the creatives but rather execute on defined requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

When interacting with an AI model, it's crucial to frame yourself as a product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Simply giving a single prompt like "build this for me" and expecting it to align with your exact vision is akin to daydreaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Instead, focus on:
*   Collecting all necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   Defining the desired flows and features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   Clearly articulating the core product being built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Without clear definitions, you will likely waste "credits" on AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. AI models are "dumb" in the sense that they predict what you're asking based on their training data but don't inherently know your intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Therefore, understanding how to define features with extreme precision and studying product management principles are key to getting the best out of AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. A product manager's role involves defining the market and customer, problem and value proposition, requirements and roadmaps, and acting as a product evangelist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The role is an intersection of UX, tech, and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Understanding Web Basics for AI SaaS Building

Having a basic understanding of web technologies is important for [[Building a startup using AI tools | building a startup using AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. A proper website or SaaS application has three main sections:
1.  **Client Side (Front End)**: What the user sees and interacts with (e.g., a portfolio website) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
2.  **Server Side (Backend)**: Where complex logic, APIs, and business operations happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
3.  **Data Storage (Database)**: Where all application data is stored, such as user information or to-do lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

Many AI tools for building applications, if not given specific instructions, will primarily focus on building the front end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. For example, prompting V0 to "create a landing page" will result in an AI-generated landing page without backend features like authentication, payments, or a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

### Backend as a Service (BaaS)

Backend as a Service (BaaS) companies help simplify the backend development, which is typically the more difficult part due to concerns like security and scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. BaaS providers build out the server and database components, allowing developers to focus mainly on the client side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

Examples of BaaS mentioned include:
*   **Superbase**: Known for offering a powerful PostgreSQL database and excellent developer experience (DX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Convex**: Excels in real-time applications like chat or collaborative tools, as it provides real-time data by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

Choosing between them depends on the specific application's needs; an AI model like ChatGPT or Claude can help determine which is better for a specific use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

## Building a SaaS with Lovable and Superbase

The Lovable AI tool is highlighted for its direct integration with Superbase, which makes setting up a full-stack application significantly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

### Demonstration: Building a Note-Taking SaaS for Founders

The demonstration involved building a note-taking SaaS specifically for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

1.  **Initial Prompt**: "I want to build a note-taking SAS for Founders. There should be user authentication, there should be a nice clean landing page explaining why founders need my SAS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.
2.  **Superbase Integration**: Lovable has a direct Superbase integration button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This allows the AI model to set up authentication and database tables with Superbase, abstracting away complex manual integration steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
3.  **Authentication Setup**: After connecting to a Superbase project, a prompt like "now make the sign up and sign in work using super base" enables full authentication functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. The tool creates database tables, writes role-level security, and handles policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. It even sends verification emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.
    *   Superbase supports various social logins like Discord, Figma, Apple, Facebook, Notion, Twitch, Slack, and Spotify, which are typically difficult to integrate manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.
4.  **Note-Taking Page and Data Persistence**: A prompt like "create the note taking page and make it so that only authenticated users can access it" creates the necessary tables for notes and ensures they are attached to the authenticated user ID for persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>.
5.  **Navigation and User Flow**: Prompts were used to add a navigation bar and define routing logic, ensuring that signed-in users are directed to the note-taking page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>.
6.  **Deployment**: Lovable also supports public deployment of the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.

This process demonstrates how a full sign-in, sign-up, and database integration for a SaaS application can be achieved with just a few prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. The hardest parts (backend, authentication, database) are made easy, leaving payments as the "final beast to conquer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>. The maintenance of authentication APIs, for example, is handled by Superbase, which is a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

## Future Trends and Key Takeaways

The rapid development of AI tools means that many traditional coding skills or complex integration knowledge may become redundant as tools integrate directly with backend services and payment solutions like Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

The competitive advantage, or "moat," for startups will shift to:
*   **Design and User Experience (UX)**: Creating richer, better experiences that solve problems effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. This is analogous to a store having appealing products that "wow" customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
*   **Distribution**: Getting the product in front of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. This is like a physical store having a prime location with high traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.

The "building" aspect of creating a SaaS application is becoming commoditized, much like the construction of a physical store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. This means a new era is emerging where non-technical founders can potentially build multi-million dollar businesses without needing a CTO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

The ability to identify and communicate what makes a great product and a fantastic user experience to an AI model will distinguish the "real winners" in this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. While engineers still have an edge in creating more performant and faster applications, the future impact of AI on development is uncertain within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

Founders are encouraged to take security seriously, especially when handling user data, even if it means hiring someone for a quick review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. Building applications still requires grit and perseverance, as even with AI tools, issues and debugging will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

Smart contracts are poised to become an increasingly integral part of business operations, offering a transparent and fair system for agreements without the need for intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. While their widespread adoption in certain areas might still be 5 to 10 years out, the concept is seen as an obvious use case for blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## How Smart Contracts Work
A smart contract is a self-executing agreement where the terms are directly written into code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. In a business context, this could mean:
*   Money is placed into escrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   If agreed-upon numbers or deliverables are met, a portion of the money is automatically released to the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   If the conditions are not met by a specified time, the money is returned to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

This system provides transparency and fairness, reducing anxiety for both parties involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Applications in Agencies and Service Providers
The application of smart contracts is particularly exciting for performance-based agencies and other service providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Performance-Based Agencies
A "pay-for-performance" agency charges clients only when specific results are achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This model ensures that marketers are incentivized to deliver value, as they are paid based on their actual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. In an [[automating_business_processes_with_ai | AI and data-driven world]], marketers can use more data to "underwrite" opportunities, making them more willing to bet on particular engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

An example is a pay-for-performance conversion rate optimization (CRO) agency. If an e-commerce conversion rate is 1% and the agency doubles it to 2%, they would take a percentage of the increased revenue, such as 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Smart contracts could automate these payments, ensuring that once the metrics are hit, the agreed-upon payment is automatically transferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Addressing Payment Issues for Service Providers
A significant benefit of smart contracts for service providers is mitigating the risk of non-payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Instances where clients, even large companies, face financial difficulties and default on payments are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. If the money for the service were held in an escrow account managed by a smart contract, it would automatically be released to the service provider once the work was completed and approved, as agreed upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This eliminates the need for lengthy and often fruitless legal action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Benefits of Smart Contracts
*   **Transparency and Fairness**: Terms are clear and execution is automatic, reducing disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Reduced Risk**: Service providers can mitigate payment risk by ensuring funds are held in escrow and released upon performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: Automation of payments based on predefined conditions speeds up transactions and reduces administrative overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Trustless System**: Removes the need to trust a third party, as the contract's execution is guaranteed by the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Future Outlook
While smart contracts are still developing, they are seen as an "obvious use case" for blockchain technology, especially in situations where trustless transactions and automated performance-based payments are desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Companies like Chainlink are already working on bringing smart contract capabilities to enterprise applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

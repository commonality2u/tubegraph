Hunter Isacson, an entrepreneur credited with over 300 million consumer app downloads, shares his playbook for scaling a consumer app from zero to $1 million in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He emphasizes that while building a business is not simple, there is a current opportunity in consumer AI and mobile apps to generate revenue without venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Hunter Isacson's Playbook for [[building_successful_consumer_apps | Consumer Apps]]

Hunter Isacson's approach focuses on simplicity, user engagement, and strategic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

### 1. Build a Simple Experience (MVP)
The core of the strategy is to create a "bare bones MVP version" of a concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. This initial version should be good enough to solve a problem, even if it's not fully optimized or has rough edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. The goal is to be "on the nose" and very obvious with the app's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

### 2. Get Users and Test Content
Once an MVP is ready, the next step is to quickly get users on the app, even if it's just a few hundred or thousand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. This involves testing content on platforms like TikTok or Instagram Reels, even during the pre-order stage, to see if people respond to the app's premise or format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

### 3. Define a Core Action (Northstar Metric)
A crucial element is to select a single "northstar metric" or core action that matters more than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Decisions should be oriented around increasing this metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
*   **Wink (make new friends app):** The northstar metric was the percentage of users who get a match on their first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **NGL (anonymous messaging app):** The core metric was the percentage of users sharing their link and multiple replies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
*   **Bags (crypto app):** The metric was how many people fund their accounts and make one trade on the first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
A high percentage for this core action means over 90% completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. The app should ideally have one main user flow, avoiding branching user journeys, to make it clear if the core action is being completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.

### 4. Build a Resonating Brand
Creating a brand that people love and understand is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. This often involves using simple, short names, or incorporating slang terms from a specific community to set a young, comfortable, and colloquial tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. The app's language and copy can also reflect this tone to make users feel understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Authenticity in public communication is crucial to build affinity and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

### 5. Designing the User Interface
Hunter Isacson designs all his apps, including branding, solo using Figma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. His experience has taught him that overly complicated designs or names can confuse users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

## Strategies for [[mobile_app_growth_strategies | Mobile App Growth]]

### Leveraging Growth Loops and Sharing Mechanisms
Once the core action is proven, the focus shifts to continuously seeding the app across different audiences and niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. A key strategy is to embed a sharing or inviting mechanism directly into the core action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. For example, apps like Laps required users to invite friends to gain access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. This creates a powerful referral loop, increasing the app's K-factor and reducing reliance on external marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

### Using Creators and Social Media (TikTok, Instagram)
Hunter Isacson's apps have primarily grown by using creators and TikTok/Instagram content to "seed" the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   NGL achieved 250 million downloads with less than $10,000 spent on marketing, primarily by seeding with TikTok and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   The app launched right when Instagram made its link feature available to all users in October 2021, creating a new growth lever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This required training millions of users on a new feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
*   Bags started building growth loops by allowing users to log in with Twitter, claim a unique link, and share it, with leaderboards incentivizing invites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.

### Reinventing Old Ideas with New Channels
Successful apps don't always need to reinvent the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Older concepts can be re-launched on new platforms or with new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. This involves identifying existing ideas that could work in a new channel where something isn't optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

## Case Studies of Successful Apps

### Cali AI
Cali AI is highlighted as a great example of packaging existing tools (like calorie tracking) with AI in a nice way, creating a good onboarding experience, and user investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They built an "amazing funnel" and made the simple app seem more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Its success was partly due to combining creators with a simple app and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Hallow
Hallow, the top app for Christian and Catholic prayers, took the Bible and made it mobile, digital, and more colorful with push notifications, appealing to younger audiences like millennials and Gen Z <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. It offers daily use cases, including daily prayers, sleep meditations, and minute meditations, fostering a strong single-player experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. It also incorporates a multiplayer experience through community challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The app uses a subscription model, including a family plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. There's potential for AI-first versions of spiritual apps, such as using GPT vision for content creation or answering complex questions using religious texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Locket
Locket was among the first apps to leverage the iPhone's widget functionality socially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, allowing users to send pictures directly to friends' home screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. It became popular within relationship and best friend communities on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### NGL

Its simple name and connection to youth slang made it easy for young people to understand its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

### Bags
Bags.fm is a crypto app that focused on building a cool brand and community from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. It strategically used crypto slang in its name, which resonated with the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. The app implemented early growth loops, such as inviting users to share their unique "bags link" after logging in with Twitter, creating leaderboards to incentivize sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.

## Future Opportunities and Tech Trends

### Augmented Reality Glasses
Hunter is very excited for augmented reality glasses, anticipating they will enable fully immersive experiences where users can prompt an app with an AI, create sharable content, and fundamentally change how AI interacts with the real world beyond phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>. He believes phones will likely serve as the driving compute for these lightweight glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring App Builders
For young people, building [[building_successful_consumer_apps | consumer mobile apps]] is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. This path offers opportunities to:
*   Understand human psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   Build products people love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>.
*   Learn how to go viral and create global experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>.
*   Directly interact with how humans use technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>.

Consumer apps are seen as "more fun" than B2B or SaaS applications, focusing on product building and marketing for a mass audience rather than contracts and business dealings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. The tools for app development are also improving, soon eliminating the need for technical expertise for [[prototyping_and_app_development_for_nonprogrammers | non-programmers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.

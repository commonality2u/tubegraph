Many founders believe that growth is the primary metric for success, often overlooking the fundamental importance of retaining existing customers and increasing their value over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Neglecting this crucial aspect can lead to a "leaky ship" scenario, where acquiring new customers doesn't lead to sustainable growth because existing ones are leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

## Churn vs. Loyalty: Shifting Focus

While "churn" is often seen as a negative four-letter word in the startup ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, focusing solely on it can be counterproductive. Instead, businesses should shift their focus to "loyalty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Loyalty, in this context, is best measured by Net Revenue Retention (NRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

### Understanding Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

Net Revenue Retention (NRR) measures how much a cohort of customers spends with a business over time, considering both retention and expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. For example, if a cohort of customers in January spends $100, and in February they spend $90 due to 10% churn, that's a negative NRR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. However, if that same cohort spends more in February than in January, it indicates positive NRR and customer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Examples of companies with high NRR include Slack, where users add more contractors or features, increasing their spend, and AWS and Snowflake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

### The Impact of NRR on Valuation

A singular focus on NRR can drastically increase a company's valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Every 3% increase in net revenue retention can double a company's valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. It also makes it significantly easier to grow and exit a business in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

## Prioritizing Retention Over Initial Growth

A common mistake founders make is jumping straight into growth and promotion before solidifying retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. It is much easier to grow a business when it has incredible customer loyalty, allowing businesses to "throw gasoline on that fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. Trying to market a product that's "kind of break even" or has high churn will make it hard to grow profitably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

Focusing on retention first prevents building a "leaky ship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. Even if a business generates significant monthly revenue, if that revenue is lost in six months due to churn, the effort is futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. It's advisable to prioritize high retention with less revenue over high revenue with poor retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.

Founders' first customers are often the most loyal because they have the biggest pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. This provides a tighter feedback loop for iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Nailing retention upfront helps develop brand equity and create a "movement," ensuring customers want to stick around long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

## Strategy: Building Skyscrapers, Not Strip Malls

The concept of [[building_businesses_with_high_margins | building businesses with high margins]] by focusing on one core product and deepening its value, akin to "building skyscrapers not strip malls," aligns directly with strong retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. Instead of launching multiple new business units, the focus should be on expanding upon the existing successful one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

AppSumo's journey demonstrates this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>:
1.  **Analyze Customer Data**: AppSumo identified that over 80% of their top customers were marketing agencies, primarily buying software to reduce monthly expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>.
2.  **Focus and Go Deeper**: They decided to focus specifically on providing software deals for marketing agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
3.  **Iterate and Scale**: By increasing the frequency of software deals, they tripled their customer lifetime value, which in turn tripled their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. This focus also benefited other customer segments as AppSumo could negotiate better deals, leading to slashed customer acquisition costs and improved KPIs across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.

This strategy showcases how focusing on a specific customer segment and increasing their loyalty can lead to significant growth, even if it means initially "ignoring" other customer types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>.

## Conclusion

The importance of retention and net revenue retention cannot be overstated. It provides a solid foundation for any business, enabling sustainable growth, increasing valuation, and offering greater optionality for future exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. By focusing on fostering loyalty and continuously increasing the value derived from existing customer cohorts, businesses can achieve substantial and lasting success, ultimately leading to a [[triple_triple_double_double_revenue_growth_strategy | $100 million business]] within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Using AI in writing involves a literal partnership with artificial intelligence to produce content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach aims to provide a baseline understanding of [[using_ai_in_content_creation|AI and writing]] and, at best, a clear framework for producing very high-quality long-form content using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Evolution of Content Creation with AI

The world is rapidly moving towards [[the_evolution_of_writing_and_content_creation_with_ai|AI in content creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Some people express concern that AI will eliminate writing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. However, this misunderstands the transformation occurring. Historically:
*   Photoshop, invented in 1990, did not ruin design; it created exponentially more designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   Instagram, launched in 2010, did not remove photographers; it made everyone a photographer, vastly increasing the amount of photography in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

Similarly, platforms like ChatGPT and Claude will make everyone a writer by reducing the barrier to entry for content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Twenty years ago, businesses struggled to conceptualize [[using_ai_in_content_creation|creating content online]] for brands like fax machines or local spas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Today, almost every business and individual understands the importance of creating and sharing content online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This indicates that branded and educational content will only continue to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Given human time constraints (8-12 working hours per day), productivity for content creation is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. AI doesn't remove jobs but rather serves as a "stress test" for skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>:
*   Those who learn to use AI to double, triple, or quadruple their output become more valuable and can earn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   Those who fail to adapt become less valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. AI changes the baseline skill level, and failure to change with it can lead to missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## How to Effectively Write with AI

### Understanding AI's Role

People often expect AI to automate tasks they don't understand how to do themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. However, AI is not a "silver bullet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. A baseline understanding of how a task should work is necessary to effectively prompt AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Conversational vs. Massive Prompts

There are two primary ways to interact with AI models like ChatGPT or Claude:
1.  **Conversationally**: Chunking things out piece by piece in a dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
2.  **Massive Prompt**: Assembling a single, large prompt that considers all potential situations and hypotheticals to generate an output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
Many people make the mistake of using a "half-baked" prompt that is mid-conversation, leading to unsatisfactory results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. When starting to write, a conversational approach is often best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### The Writing Process with AI

#### 1. Ideation and Headline Generation
Start with a seed of an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Determine if the idea itself is the main topic or a sub-point within a larger idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
Define your content goals (e.g., connected to startup ideas, actionable, tied to a specific story) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
Plug these goals into AI (ChatGPT or Claude) to feed you ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
Ask for potential headlines and 3-5 main points under each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. The AI helps generate many iterations of ideas, a task traditionally handled by junior writers or columnists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
The human role becomes that of an "editor-in-chief," applying taste and context to select the best options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

#### 2. Crafting Hooks and Using Templates
Once a headline is chosen, it can be adapted for different mediums (e.g., an article or a Twitter thread hook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
Use a successful hook as a template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. This is not stealing content, but "stealing the architecture" or "bones of the house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. This process of adapting existing formats is something human intuition already does; making it conscious allows for more deliberate application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
To train the AI, provide it with your original viral hook, then your manually created adaptation based on your new idea. Then, ask the AI to generate more variations of the adapted hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. This creates a "mini-model" for the AI to learn from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

#### 3. Structuring Content: The "Chunks of Three" Framework
For an 800-word article (or similar long-form content for X, Medium, Quora), think in terms of "chunks of three" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.
A typical structure includes an intro and three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.
The primary value of a piece lies in its headline and the quality of its three main points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. Main points should be specific and tangible to convince the reader the content is worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. If the promise isn't clear or the main points don't deliver, readers will disengage quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.

#### 4. The "10 Magical Ways" Framework
To overcome writer's block and make content more tangible, use the "10 Magical Ways" framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. This framework helps identify what type of information will be given to the reader (e.g., tips, stats, steps, lessons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.
For example, if the headline promises "three lessons," the three main subheads should explicitly be "Lesson 1," "Lesson 2," and "Lesson 3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.
The highest leverage decision is the *content* of these three lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>. The value is in the insight, not just the eloquent prose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.
Subheads should be like sentences, clearly stating the value the reader will receive from that section, rather than vague, clever titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.

#### 5. Iterative Refinement with AI
Attempt to generate the main points yourself first, then compare and refine them with AI's suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
Provide the AI with your preferred headline and main points, then ask it to generate more batches of main points for stress-testing and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. Your "taste" and context remain crucial in filtering AI outputs, as AI may generate options that are technically correct but contextually inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
The back-and-forth conversational process with AI creates "Lego blocks" of refined content and prompts, which can later be assembled into "mega prompts" for future, faster content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>.

#### 6. Filling in the Details
Once the three main points are finalized, return to the "10 Magical Ways" to decide what specific type of content will populate each section (e.g., steps, stats, examples, reasons why) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. This pre-planning makes the actual writing much easier, as all key decisions have been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.
You can then articulate these decisions to the AI, asking it to generate a V1 of the content, which you then edit and refine section by section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

## The Value of Education in the AI Age

In the age of AI, paying for or seeking education, such as courses, books, or talks, is incredibly powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>. Education allows you to "download" specific frameworks (e.g., for writing first sentences, headlines, or formatting) into your personal knowledge repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.
Once you internalize these frameworks, you can articulate them to AI, dramatically increasing your productivity, efficiency, and quality of output for the rest of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>. This transforms years of learned experience into minutes of absorption, providing an unbelievable return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>. To gain digital leverage and become an expert, you need to level up by educating yourself, downloading frameworks, and then [[utilizing_ai_to_create_marketing_content_and_automate_processes|utilizing AI to create marketing content and automate processes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.

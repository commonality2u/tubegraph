This article explores how AI is reshaping the writing landscape, offering frameworks and practical strategies for writers to leverage this technology.

## Writing with AI: A New Paradigm
The discussion centers on writing *with* AI in the most literal sense, demonstrating how writers can integrate AI into their workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The goal is to provide a baseline understanding of using AI in writing and a clear framework for producing high-quality long-form content with its assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### The Power of Writing Frameworks
Understanding writing frameworks is crucial because they apply across various content types, such as thread hooks, LinkedIn posts, or articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Human beings often struggle with orthogonal thinking, failing to see how a specific writing skill (like a Twitter thread hook) can be applied to emails, articles, or landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. These skills are powerful because once understood, they are universally applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## AI: Evolution, Not Extinction for Writers
There's a common misconception that AI will eliminate writing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This fails to understand the true impact of AI on professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Historical Precedents
Historically, new technologies haven't destroyed creative fields but rather expanded them:
*   **Photoshop (1990):** Didn't ruin design; it created exponentially more designers and design in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This aligns with [[the_rise_of_ai_in_design_and_creative_industries | The rise of AI in design and creative industries]].
*   **Instagram (2010):** Didn't remove photographers; it made everyone a photographer, significantly increasing the amount of photography globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This relates to [[the_role_of_ai_in_reshaping_digital_content_and_social_media | the role of AI in reshaping digital content and social media]].

Similarly, AI writing platforms like ChatGPT and Claude will make everyone a writer by reducing the barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### The Expanding Demand for Content
Twenty years ago, businesses like fax machine brands or local spas couldn't imagine creating content online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Today, nearly every business and individual understands the importance of creating and sharing content online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This signifies that the demand for branded, educational content will only continue to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Human productivity, however, is constrained by time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. AI bridges this gap by increasing output exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### AI as a "Stress Test" for Value
AI doesn't remove jobs; it acts as a stress test for adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Those who learn to use AI to double, triple, or quadruple their output will become more valuable and earn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Those who don't adapt will become less valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

> "People canate the two they think AI stole my job that's not what happened AI changed the barrier to entry and changed the Baseline skill level you failed to change with it and then AI says well you didn't change so you don't get the next opportunity which is like Darwinism at its finest right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>

AI is changing things, and individuals must change with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## How to Write *with* AI: A Practical Framework
[[Enhancing writer productivity with AI | Enhancing writer productivity with AI]] means understanding how to interact with AI models effectively.

### The Foundation: Understanding the Manual Process
AI is not a silver bullet; users must have a baseline understanding of how things are supposed to work to prompt AI effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This is comparable to a CEO needing to understand a department before delegating it to an intern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Idea Generation and Structuring
When starting with a "seed of an idea," the first decision is whether it's the main idea or a sub-point within a larger concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. For example, Reed Hastings' "no Blockbuster rule" could be the central theme of an article or one of three strange rules from different CEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

The process involves setting clear goals for the content, such as connecting to startup ideas, being actionable, and relating to a specific anecdote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

### Interacting with AI: Conversational vs. Comprehensive Prompts
There are two main ways to interact with AI models like ChatGPT or Claude:
1.  **Conversationally:** Chunking things out piece by piece in a dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
2.  **Massive Prompt:** Assembling a single, comprehensive prompt with all potential situations and hypotheticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

Many people make mistakes by using a "half-baked" prompt that's neither fully conversational nor comprehensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Starting conversationally is often effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

#### Example: Generating Headlines and Main Points
A writer can provide AI with an idea and content goals, then ask for multiple potential headlines and three to five main points for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. This defers the lower-leverage task of generating variations to the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This process mirrors how an editor-in-chief tasks a columnist with ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. The writer then acts as the editor-in-chief, using their "taste" to select the best options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

### The Importance of Pre-Writing Decisions
Many crucial decisions in writing are made before the actual writing begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. Starting with a Google Doc and immediately writing is a common mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Pre-determining ideas and conclusions makes the writing process significantly easier and allows for leveraging AI for lower-leverage tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

### Adapting Content Across Platforms
Writing frameworks are universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. A headline chosen for an article can be adapted into a viral Twitter/X thread hook by applying a successful template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. This involves "stealing the architecture," not the content itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. This process of using templates is not "unreal writing"; it's a conscious application of what the human brain already does intuitively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

By manually creating a new version of a successful hook, a "mini-model" is created for the AI to learn from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. This allows the writer to prompt AI for more variations, continuously improving the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. The fundamental piece is knowing how to prompt the AI correctly, which leads to better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

### Structuring an Article (800 words)
A typical 800-word article often consists of an introduction and three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. The key is to define these three sections upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.

#### The Value Equation: Headline and Main Points
90% of a piece's value is determined by its headline and the quality of its three main points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. If subheads are vague (e.g., "learn about money," "hire a CPA," "don't be dumb"), readers will immediately deem the content worthless and leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. Specific, tangible main points (e.g., "take advantage of this loophole," "use a personal S Corp," "buy Section 8 Housing") significantly increase engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

Many writers make the mistake of focusing on individual words and sentences before clarifying the promise of the headline and how the main points deliver on that promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.

#### The 10 Magical Ways Framework
This framework helps writers overcome writer's block by categorizing content into 10 types (e.g., tips, stats, steps, lessons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.
*   **Clarifying the Headline:** Use this framework to make the headline more tangible by specifying what the reader will receive (e.g., "three lessons") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>. Adding big numbers to headlines (e.g., "361 billion streaming service") often improves performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.
*   **Aligning Subheads:** The subheads must clearly deliver on the promise in the headline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. If the headline promises "three lessons," the subheads should be "Lesson 1," "Lesson 2," and "Lesson 3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.
*   **High-Leverage Decisions:** The quality of these three core lessons (or whatever is promised) is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>. Poor lessons will result in a "shitty piece" regardless of how well it's written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.
*   **Iterating with AI:** Writers should first attempt to define their main points, then use AI to "stress test" and generate more batches of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. This allows for refinement and identification of better opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. The writer's "taste" and context remain crucial in selecting and refining AI-generated options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
*   **Actionable Subheads:** Subheads should be more like clear, bolded sentences that convey value, rather than clever but vague titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. This ensures the reader understands what they will gain from each section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.
*   **Content within Sections:** Once the main points are clear, apply the "10 magical ways" again to determine the content type for each section (e.g., steps, stats, examples, reasons why) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. This pre-planning makes the actual writing process straightforward, as decisions are already made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>. AI can then be prompted to generate V1 drafts for each section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

## The Value of Education in the AI Age
Paying for education, especially in the digital age, is incredibly powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>. When a course teaches writing frameworks (e.g., how to write first sentences, headlines, formatting), it's essentially downloading those frameworks into a writer's "repository" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>. This allows individuals to articulate these learned frameworks to AI, dramatically increasing their productivity, efficiency, and quality of output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>. This exemplifies [[impact_of_ai_on_business_efficiency | the impact of AI on business efficiency]].

What might take years to learn manually can be internalized in minutes through structured education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>. The return on investment for acquiring these frameworks, which can then be leveraged with AI, is "unbelievable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>. The goal is to become an expert and gain digital leverage by educating oneself, downloading frameworks, and then using AI to "take it to the Nth degree" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.

Creating winning ads with AI, particularly using models like ChatGPT 4.0, can significantly increase return on ad spend (ROAS) and contribute to a profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This guide outlines how to leverage these tools to generate effective visual content for advertising.

## Understanding ChatGPT 4.0 for Ad Creation

ChatGPT 4.0 is a powerful image model that excels at generating visual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Unlike pure image models (like Midjourney or Ideogram), ChatGPT 4.0 is a multimodal language model, meaning prompting is less critical because it has a better understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Key Principles for Ad Creation

### The Importance of Images in Prompting
For [[techniques_for_prompting_chatgpt_40_to_design_effective_visual_content | creating content with AI tools]], especially for ads, inspiration images and product images are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. A picture is often worth a thousand words, making reference images highly effective in guiding the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

### When to Use Reference Images
AI models like ChatGPT have a strong understanding of well-known concepts, ideas, and brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge Wallets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For such established entities, you can often prompt directly. However, for relatively new or smaller products without significant online presence (millions in ad spend monthly), it's always recommended to provide a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Practical Techniques for Ad Generation

### 1. Recreating Ads with Inspiration and Product Images
This technique involves providing an existing ad for inspiration and a custom product image to integrate.
*   **Process**: Upload an inspiration ad and your product image. Provide a basic prompt to combine them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Example**: An ad for "Jones Road Beauty" was created by taking an existing ad as inspiration and adding a product image with a simple prompt like "add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The AI intelligently followed the instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Scalability**: This method allows for easy experimentation by swapping out character images (men, women, old, young, different colors) to see what converts best for various audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. ChatGPT can generate photorealistic images of different audiences, or you can use your own photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. When the API becomes available, generating hundreds of targeted ads based on different audiences will be trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### 2. Creating Ads Without Reference Images (for well-known brands)
When working with globally recognized brands, you can create ads from scratch using detailed prompts.
*   **Keywords**: Use terms like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to ensure high-quality output, as the AI might default to a cartoonish style otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide a strong, detailed prose description of the desired image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Styling**: You can specify font types (e.g., "exo2 bold italic"), color styles, and aspect ratios within the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Example**: An Adidas ad featuring a female runner in the Egyptian desert with pyramids in the background was created solely from a detailed text prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### 3. Leveraging Sora's Explore Page for Ideation
Sora, which uses the same underlying model as ChatGPT, offers an explore page where users can see how others are prompting and get inspiration for their own ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Prompt Transparency**: Clicking on any image in Sora's explore page reveals the exact prompt used to generate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: You can remix, adjust, or edit prompts directly in Sora, change aspect ratios, or upload your own reference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Finding Aesthetics**: This feature is invaluable for generating creative ideas and discovering unique aesthetics not commonly used in your industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### 4. Changing the Concept of an Existing Ad
AI allows you to quickly adapt existing ad concepts for new products, themes, or holidays.
*   **Process**: Provide an existing ad and your product image, then instruct the AI to change elements like background, price, or theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Example 1**: An ad for "Athletic Greens" (AG1) was created by using an existing "Rise" ad as a reference. The prompt instructed the AI to "recreate this ad for ag1 adjust the background to better fit athletic green Style change the price ... to $85 now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. The AI accurately incorporated product images, pricing, and a suitable background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
    *   *Ethical Considerations*: While remixing existing ads may seem "dirty" because it reuses concepts another company invested in, it's a common practice in advertising, where companies already use inspiration ads and templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. AI merely makes this process more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   **Example 2**: A "Ridge Wallet" Black Friday ad was transformed into a Christmas-themed ad by simply swapping the product image (to a green wallet) and prompting "swap it out and change it to a Christmas style ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
*   **Event-Based Advertising**: AI enables rapid response to news cycles and topical events, creating timely and relevant ads that would have been prohibitively expensive and slow to produce previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. An example is an ad for "Rippling" that parodied a news controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

## Tips for Effective Prompting

*   **Be Clear and Direct**: Explicitly state what you want the AI to generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Start New Chats for Adjustments**: If an initial prompt doesn't yield desired results, start a new conversation. Continuing in the same thread often leads to a degradation of image quality because the AI uses its own generated image as a reference, inheriting its flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Specify "Generate the Image"**: To prevent the AI from generating text descriptions instead of images, explicitly include "generate the image" in your prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Specify Language**: Explicitly prompt the AI to write in English to avoid confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Dimensions/Aspect Ratios**: ChatGPT 4.0 often defaults to 9x16, but you can specify other aspect ratios like 1x1 or 9x16 in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

## Finding Ad Inspiration

Several tools can help you find inspiration and templates for ads:
*   Creative OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>
*   ForPlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   icon.me (which aggregates from Meta Ad Library) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>

## Live Example: Creating an Ad for LCA

This example demonstrates the iterative process of [[creating_content_with_ai_tools | creating content with AI tools]] for an unknown brand.

### Initial Setup
1.  **Identify Key Brand Elements**: Gather screenshots of the company's logo, typography, coloring, and key differentiators (e.g., "SWAT team design agency," "works with the best companies," client list like Dropbox, Salesforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
2.  **Choose an Inspiration Style**: For a luxury brand like LCA, a vintage Rolex ad style was chosen over a futuristic or newspaper style, to convey exclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
3.  **Craft the Initial Prompt**: Upload the gathered images and the inspiration ad.
    *   **Prompt Example**: "Generate a digital ad for LCA (Late Checkout Agency). LCA is a SWAT team design agency only for the most interesting brands on the planet helping them with building AI first tools. It only works with the best companies. I have provided some screenshots from their website for you to use as inspiration in the ad as well as a reference vintage Rolex ad as inspiration. Use this to capture the luxury Vibe of the company. Generate the image." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>

### First Iteration Analysis
*   The AI generated an ad with good copy ("Leaders at billion dollar Brands choose LCA to Define their future") and a man pointing, capturing the desired luxury vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
*   **Issue**: It included a Rolex watch on the man's wrist, indicating the AI interpreted the Rolex inspiration too literally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. This highlights the need for refinement.

### Second Iteration (New Chat)
*   **Principle**: To refine, start a *new* chat to avoid degrading the image quality over successive prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.
*   **Refined Prompt**: "Rather than generating a watch, show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>
*   **Outcome**: The new ad successfully replaced the watch with company logos (e.g., Salesforce, Dropbox), maintaining the luxury feel and incorporating the company's subheadings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

Creating ads with AI like ChatGPT 4.0 is a game of experimentation at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. By understanding how to effectively prompt, use reference images, and iterate, businesses can quickly generate diverse and highly targeted ad creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This capability allows for more personal, entertaining, and effective advertising by rapidly testing different visuals for various audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

Traditional marketing funnels are considered "entirely the wrong way to think about marketing" in the modern era due to their deceptive nature regarding actual customer buying behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Instead, a new paradigm called "digital gravity" is proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Digital Gravity: A New Marketing Paradigm

Digital gravity describes how brands are built and companies grow by accumulating "digital mass" on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The more digital mass a company has, the more influence it exerts within its niche or sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This mass is built through consistent content creation and marketing across all platforms where customers are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Instead of the linear journey of a funnel, customer interaction is more akin to a comet getting "sucked back in" for multiple rotations before finally "touching down" (making a purchase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The "digital gravity" model emphasizes continuous marketing rather than campaigns with a start and stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The goal is to constantly add mass to the company, shifting the mindset of how marketing is conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## [[utilizing_ai_for_marketing_strategies | Leveraging AI and Technology for Scale and Automation]]

Modern marketing relies heavily on [[using_ai_to_scale_and_automate_marketing_tasks | using AI to scale and automate marketing tasks]] to increase reach, efficiency, and impact.

### AI-Powered Ad Creation

For B2B companies, a key strategy involves importing scraped customer emails into ad platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads to run custom match lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

*   **AI Avatar Ads:** User-generated content (UGC) AI avatar ads are recommended, focusing on pain points experienced by the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
    *   **Tools:** HeyGen is used for creating the AI avatar due to its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Eleven Labs provides the voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
    *   **Strategy:** Create numerous variations (e.g., 100) of the ad with different hooks, settings, backgrounds, and content, focusing on various pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. The best-performing variations (lowest CPC) receive the majority of the ad budget, with a portion reserved for continuous testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
    *   **[[using_ai_for_storytelling_and_marketing | Storytelling with AI Avatars]]:** The angle for AI avatar ads should be a problem-solution orientation within a storytelling format, similar to the "Hero's Journey" cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

### Automating Cold Email Outreach

Cold email remains a viable marketing tactic when approached strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

*   **Tools:** Mail Reef is suggested for sending large volumes of cold emails (e.g., 50,000 emails for $400/month) from specialized AWS servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. Smartlead or Instantly AI are also recommended as cold email sending software, allowing multiple email accounts to be managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   **Domain Isolation:** It is crucial to use separate domains for transactional emails (from the core app domain), newsletter emails, and cold emails to prevent a compromised domain from affecting critical communications like password resets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **Content:** Cold emails should align with the problem-solution orientation used in ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

### [[utilizing_ai_for_writing_and_content_creation | AI-Driven Content Generation and Repurposing]]

Creating vast amounts of content is crucial for building digital mass. Technology greatly assists in this process.

*   **Podcast Creation:** Record customer conversations and feedback, formalize them, and turn them into a podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
*   **Repurposing Content:**
    *   **Tool:** Swell AI is an example of a software built to automate content repurposing from video podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. It can extract pain points, generate transcripts, create blog posts, white papers, clips, show notes, and media assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. This process, which once required a team of five, can now be managed by one person or a virtual assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.
    *   **AI Remixing:** For consumer marketing, variations of high-performing UGC content can be remixed using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>. ChatGPT can change scripts, HeyGen creates videos, and Eleven Labs handles audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. CapCut can be used for green screen removal to place AI avatars over app visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

### [[using_ai_in_lead_enrichment and marketing | Data Scraping for Audience Identification]]

Identifying and reaching the target audience at scale is facilitated by data scraping tools.

*   **Email Scraping:** For B2B, tools like Apollo.io can extract thousands of emails (e.g., 10,000 for $99/month) based on industry filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. LinkedIn can also be used for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Influencer Identification:** For consumer marketing, YouTube allows scraping of emails from creator bios within specific categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. Tools like IGleads.ai can scrape emails from Instagram accounts based on hashtags or keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.

### Programmatic SEO with AI

As a website gains domain authority, programmatic SEO can be implemented for consumer products to rank for longtail keywords.

*   **Strategy:** Scrape top-ranking content for target keywords, use AI to create a blog post outline, and then write the post section by section using AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.
*   **Scale:** Publish a large volume of articles (e.g., 10,000), allowing AI to write them initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. Once a page receives traffic, a human SEO or content specialist refines the content for readability and to meet Google's ranking criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.
*   **Conversion:** Implement calls to action (CTAs) within the article (e.g., after the first paragraph, and a popup at 25-50% scroll rate) to drive app sign-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>. Website visitors are then pixeled for remarketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

### Case Study: Sunflower Sober App

The Sunflower Sober app, a sober tracking application, exemplifies strong consumer growth through the integration of AI. It includes an AI-powered sponsor feature that drives "unbelievable" engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. Their acquisition strategy heavily relies on Facebook ads at an effective price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>.

Many successful entrepreneurs achieve significant wealth through "boring, sweaty businesses" rather than high-tech ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. According to Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," wealthy individuals often built their fortunes doing something seemingly mundane, such as underground utilities, surveying, HVAC, or real estate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The key is to increase your odds of getting rich by choosing a "normal, boring" path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Nick Huber's Entrepreneurial Journey

Nick Huber's own journey exemplifies this philosophy, starting with a basic, hands-on service business and scaling into significant assets. His approach highlights [[entrepreneurship_strategies_for_profitability | profitability]] from the outset and strategic expansion.

### Storage Squad: A Pickup and Delivery Storage Business

Huber's first significant venture was Storage Squad, a pickup and delivery storage business for college students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Concept**: Students going home for the summer would have their boxes stored in a warehouse and then delivered back to them when they returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Origins**: The idea came spontaneously when someone, responding to Huber's Craigslist ad for apartment leasing, asked to store their belongings in his apartment instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. He immediately made $150 and realized the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping & Marketing**: The business was bootstrapped with minimal capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Early marketing relied heavily on sidewalk chalk ads placed on student walking paths, personally written over 5,000 times by Huber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. They didn't use paid ads until 2017, by which point they were generating over $2 million in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Operations**: The business acquired used cargo vans for cheap (e.g., $1,500 on Craigslist, $2,200 box truck) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. At its peak, Storage Squad handled items for over 2,000 students, storing more than 5,000 boxes in a 35,000 sq ft warehouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Financial Success**: At its peak, the business generated $2.2 million in annual revenue and earned $400,000-$500,000 in profit per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. It was profitable from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Exit**: Huber sold Storage Squad in 2020 for $1.75 million, with no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This exemplifies [[scaling_and_exiting_a_business_for_multimillion_dollar_gains | multimillion dollar gains]] from a "boring" venture.

### Transition to Self-Storage Facilities

Leveraging the success of Storage Squad, Huber and his partner transitioned into owning and managing self-storage facilities, another prime example of [[profitable_startup_ideas | profitable startup ideas]] in the "sweaty" sector.

1.  **Erie, Pennsylvania Facility**:
    *   **Acquisition**: Purchased at public auction in 2019 for $625,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
    *   **Details**: Over 40,000 sq ft with more than 180 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   **Turnaround Opportunity**: The previous owner had neglected the facility, which was generating only $4,000 a month in revenue and had over a hundred abandoned, empty units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This offered a clear path for value creation.

2.  **North Georgia Facility**:
    *   **Acquisition**: Bought for $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   **Growth**: Initial revenue was about $15,600-$16,000 per month; it now generates $40,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: The property is currently valued at $4.5 million, representing a $2 million increase in worth without any "spectacular" inventions or external funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This again demonstrates [[scaling_and_exiting_a_business_for_multimillion_dollar_gains | significant gains]] from conventional business models.

Huber notes that such opportunities are "happening in plain sight to make really good money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Why "Boring" Businesses are Attractive

Huber strongly advocates for "boring" businesses, especially when considering [[entrepreneurial_motivations_and_challenges | entrepreneurial motivations and challenges]] and competition.
*   **Contrast with Tech/AI Startups**: While many aspire to build software, SaaS, or [[aidriven_startup_ideas_and_entrepreneurship | AI-driven startup ideas and entrepreneurship]], Huber argues that these highly competitive sectors have very low rates of profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. He estimates that only about 1% of AI startups will make it to profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
*   **Lower Competition**: The competition in "sweaty startups" is often less sophisticated. Rather than competing with Stanford computer science graduates backed by venture capital, one competes with local businesses that might not even answer the phone or utilize modern business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.
*   **Higher Odds of Success**: Huber likens choosing a business to playing against a "fifth-grade girl in basketball" for $30,000 a month, rather than LeBron James for a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. The odds of winning and making money are significantly higher in the former scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Profitability**: Many [[examples_of_successful_sweaty_startups | examples of successful sweaty startups]] can be profitable from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### The Role of Digital Real Estate

Huber emphasizes the importance of investing in a strong domain name, viewing it as "digital real estate" for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   He argues that businesses readily spend hundreds of thousands or millions on physical real estate or renovations but balk at spending more than a few hundred dollars on a domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
*   His own *Somewhere.com* domain cost $450,000, and he attests that he has already received more than that in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
*   A memorable and easily spelle d.com domain can significantly increase organic traffic and leads, easily justifying its cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

## Conclusion

Nick Huber's journey and philosophy underscore that substantial wealth can be built by identifying and excelling in "boring" service-based industries. These [[examples_of_successful_sweaty_startups | examples of successful sweaty startups]] often involve tangible work—cleaning, moving, repairing—and can be bootstrapped, offering higher odds of success than many high-tech ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

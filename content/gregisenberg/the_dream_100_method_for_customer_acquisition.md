For startups aiming to [[getting_first_customers_without_a_social_media_following | get customers for your startup without a social following]] or spending heavily on ads, the Dream 100 method offers a strategic approach to customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This tutorial outlines how to leverage existing audiences and deliver value without needing to be a social media influencer or consistently create content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## What is The Dream 100?

The Dream 100 method involves identifying other individuals or organizations who already have access to your target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The goal is to partner with or provide value to these entities to gain exposure to their established following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Step 1: Create Your Dream 100 List
Begin by making a list (e.g., in a spreadsheet) of people or organizations who are already communicating with your desired audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

*   **Example: Web Design Agency Targeting Founders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
    *   **Podcast Hosts:** Individuals who host podcasts for startup owners or founders (e.g., Greg, the host of "Startup Ideas Podcast") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   **Platforms:** Websites or communities where founders congregate (e.g., Product Hunt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
    *   **Meetup Organizers:** Individuals running local entrepreneur meetups or organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Fill out details like their main website and social media presence to understand their audience and reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Spending a day on this research can provide a wealth of potential partners and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

### Step 2: Determine Your Value Proposition
Once you have your list, brainstorm what you can offer each person or organization that would allow you to be exposed to their audience while also providing them significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

*   **Paid Advertisement:** Directly purchasing ad space on their platform, as seen with Daring Fireball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Partnership/Collaboration:** Offering to host a segment on their podcast, write a guest post, or co-create content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Strategic Gifting:** Providing a personalized, thoughtful gift that resonates with them, even if it's not expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This makes your outreach more about the other person and stacks the cards in your favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

### Step 3: Master the Outreach (Canvas Strategy)
Reaching out to busy, influential people requires an artful approach. The "Canvas Strategy," developed by Ryan Holiday, teaches how to be helpful to those "above you" in the business hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

*   **Don't Ask, Offer:** Instead of asking for something (e.g., "Can I come on your podcast?"), present a well-thought-out pitch explaining why having you on would be valuable to them and their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Demonstrate Effort:** Put genuine effort into your pitch, showing you respect their time and platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Benefits of The Dream 100 Method
*   **High Leverage:** Contacting even one person from your Dream 100 list can generate more leads or traffic than other extensive marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Significant Returns:** This strategy can lead to substantial revenue; one example generated tens of millions of dollars through a single partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Growth:** It can lead to "step-function explosive growth" when other [[optimizing_conversion_rates_using_sales_funnels | optimizing the crap out of them]] for small gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.
*   **Low Initial Cost:** It allows you to get customers and feedback without significant ad spend or the need for a large social media following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Complementary Strategies for Customer Acquisition

Beyond the Dream 100, several other tactics can help acquire customers, especially in the early stages of a startup.

### 1. Engage in Communities and Groups
Find where your audience is already congregating and spend time there, delivering extreme value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

*   **Identify Communities:** Look for groups on platforms like School (e.g., Startup Empire), Discord, Facebook, or even Reddit groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **Be a Valuable Contributor:** For the first month, focus on providing immense value without spamming or trying to get work. Answer questions thoroughly, share free templates, and help others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.
*   **Quora and YouTube Comments:** Answer questions on Quora with detailed, high-quality responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. Engage thoughtfully in the comment sections of niche-specific YouTube channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. This builds trust with creators and other commenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

### 2. Create High-Effort, Low-Quality Content
For those uncomfortable being the "face" of a brand, creating valuable, long-form content can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

*   **Focus on Utility:** Create comprehensive tutorials or "how-to" videos that solve specific problems for your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.
*   **Over-the-Top Value:** Aim to make content so valuable that viewers feel "almost guilty for consuming it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. For example, a web designer could record a 5-hour, zero-to-finished landing page build using Loom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.
*   **Quality vs. Effort:** The visual quality doesn't need to be high (e.g., 720p is fine), but the effort and depth of information should be extensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. Many people passively consume long-form content to learn through osmosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.

By combining the Dream 100 method with active community engagement and high-value content creation, startups can gain significant momentum and acquire clients without relying on social media influence or traditional advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. These are high-leverage activities that generate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.

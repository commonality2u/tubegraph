The emergence of AI-powered services, particularly in coaching and assistance, has opened new avenues for business. These services, often built on large language models like ChatGPT, are demonstrating significant revenue potential, prompting discussions about their sustainability and impact on traditional human-led services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## The Rise of AI Coaching Apps

A notable example is the "Riz app" (Plug AI), an AI dating coach built on top of ChatGPT, which reportedly generates $190,000 per month and sees 333,000 downloads monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:07">[02:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:09">[02:12:09]</a>. The founder sourced the idea from a Tinder subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:22">[02:15:22]</a>.

This [[ai_in_customer_support_and_automation | AI in customer support and automation]] leverages ChatGPT as a "wrapper" focused on companionship and dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:19">[03:17:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:44">[03:23:44]</a>. The success of such applications often relies more on effective marketing and branding than on unique product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:05">[04:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:11">[04:07:11]</a>. For instance, the name "Riz" (derived from "charisma") resonates with its target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. Referral flows within the app also contribute significantly to its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

The 23-year-old founder's development studio, AI Riz, has launched three apps, nearing $500,000 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. These apps include:
*   **Plug AI** (also known as Riz): A texting assistant that provides pickup lines based on screenshots of text messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
*   **Astra**: An AI offering life advice on topics such as relationships, personal growth, and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
*   **Pallet**: Determines a user's color season from a selfie and generates personalized style and makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

These apps collectively demonstrate a strategy of [[transforming_traditional_services_with_ai | transforming traditional services with AI]] by offering coaching in specific verticals, leveraging existing technology, and focusing on strong branding and positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

## Hype or Sustainable Business?

The rapid success of [[automated_business_with_ai_assistants | automated business with AI assistants]] raises questions about their long-term viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. While some view these ventures as "flash in the pan" due to their reliance on underlying platforms like OpenAI, others argue that even short-term success can provide significant financial stability and transferable business skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

There is significant competition in the AI assistant space, with many new products emerging daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. To stand out, entrepreneurs are advised to explore "non-obvious" use cases for [[building_ai_agents_for_business_automation | building AI agents for business automation]] rather than focusing on obvious areas like dating or therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## The "Anti-Trend": Human-Powered Services

An interesting counter-trend to [[advantages_of_ai_over_human_employees | advantages of AI over human employees]] is the potential for human-led services to thrive in the face of AI automation. As AI coaching and assistance become prevalent, an "anti-trend" of human-powered alternatives can emerge, potentially commanding a premium price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.

For example, a business could offer a human version of an AI dating coach, providing personalized assistance and potentially charging a higher price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. This approach leverages the marketing and positioning strategies used by AI companies but redirects them to human-delivered services, which may appeal to users seeking a more personal touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. This concept suggests that while [[automating_business_tasks_with_ai | automating business tasks with AI]] is a significant trend, an equal demand for human connection and expertise will persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. These "anti-trends" often face less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

## Financial Practicality and Risks

While AI apps built on platforms like OpenAI carry the risk of platform changes (e.g., increased charges), their rapid profitability makes them attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The founder of AI Riz, for instance, operates three apps across different niches to mitigate this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

From a financial perspective, generating substantial profit in a short period (e.g., $350,000 profit per month, potentially $4 million in a year) can provide founders with "first nut" capital, enabling financial stability or funding for future endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. This pragmatic approach prioritizes individual financial freedom over the "change the world" narrative often seen in the startup ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. The skills learned from scaling such businesses are highly transferable, regardless of the ultimate longevity of a specific app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. While some view [[ai_as_a_replacement_for_traditional_workforce | AI as a replacement for traditional workforce]], others see opportunity in a hybrid model or the "anti-trend" of human-powered services.

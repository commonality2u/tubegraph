While Manis AI has generated significant buzz for its capabilities in converting ideas into automated businesses and products, it also presents several [[Challenges with AI Design Tools | limitations and issues]] that users should consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## Current Access Restrictions
Access to Manis AI is currently by invitation only, with a limited number of invitation codes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:54:00">[49:54:00]</a>. Users are also subject to a maximum daily usage limit, typically around 10 requests or sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:15:00">[57:15:00]</a>.

## Technical and Performance Challenges
Manis AI is still in its beta stage, and as such, users may encounter various errors and performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>.
*   **Getting Stuck** The AI has been observed getting stuck during tasks, such as when encountering CAPTCHAs during web browsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a> or while collecting data from external sources like websites and social media profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:57:00">[24:57:00]</a>. This can lead to critical issues, requiring the user to reset the AI's "computer" or start a new session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>.
*   **Context Limitations** One of the most significant limitations is that Manis AI's performance can decline with "extremely long contexts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:19:00">[44:19:00]</a>. This can occur when dealing with very complex tasks or processing large amounts of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:00">[44:50:00]</a>. This issue can necessitate starting an entirely new session, which is considered a significant drawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>.
*   **Deployment Difficulties** While Manis AI can generate code for applications, the deployment process is not always straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:19:00">[47:19:00]</a>. It may encounter issues during public deployment attempts, sometimes suggesting local execution instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:02:00">[35:02:00]</a>. There have also been instances where it failed to complete zipping files for local download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:25:00">[46:25:00]</a>. This indicates that their deployment process still needs refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:41:00">[47:41:00]</a>.
*   **Output Refinement** While Manis AI can produce functional applications, it may not always create the desired aesthetic or comprehensive features in a single prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:31:00">[58:31:00]</a>. Users may need to provide specific follow-up instructions to refine the design or add more objects and details to a scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:43:00">[58:43:00]</a>.

## Scale and Reliability
As more users gain access to Manis AI, the system has experienced increased frequency of errors, suggesting challenges with scaling its infrastructure to meet demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:57:00">[50:57:00]</a>. This is a significant issue that needs to be addressed before a full public launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:08:00">[51:08:00]</a>.

## Data Security and Privacy Concerns
As a Chinese company, Manis AI raises [[Concerns and considerations using AI developed by Chinese companies | valid concerns]] regarding data privacy and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>. Chinese companies are often obligated to provide government access to data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40:00">[27:40:00]</a>. Therefore, users are advised to be very careful about the type of data and personal information they share with the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>. For instance, connecting sensitive accounts like Stripe is cautioned against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:16:00">[33:16:00]</a>. It is also recommended to scan generated code before running it locally and to operate within a virtual sandbox environment for added security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:14:00">[55:14:00]</a>.

Despite these [[Current limitations and future potential of AI coding tools | limitations]], Manis AI is recognized as a significant step forward in agentic AI, providing a glimpse into the future of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

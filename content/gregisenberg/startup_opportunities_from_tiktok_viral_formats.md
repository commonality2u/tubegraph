The proliferation of viral content formats on TikTok presents a significant opportunity for entrepreneurs to build new businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. People are actively seeking out the latest viral formats and templates on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, a trend confirmed by high search volumes, with "TikTok template trend" seeing 98,000 searches in the past month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.

## Core Opportunity

The central idea is to help individuals and brands identify and utilize the TikTok formats that are currently going viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. This addresses a clear market need for quick access to trending content strategies.

## Startup Ideas

### 1. Viral TikTok Format Newsletter

An effective startup idea is to build an email newsletter that curates and distributes trending TikTok formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.
This newsletter would:
*   Highlight formats currently going viral on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
*   Provide guidance on how brands can adapt and use these formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.
*   Potentially include a "one-button click" feature that allows users to jump into an editor to create their own version, similar to Jason Levan's Memelord Technologies which provides viral meme templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.

### Potential Evolution and Monetization
*   **Technology Integration**: The newsletter could evolve into a full-fledged video editor specifically designed for TikTok, or even a social media scheduling application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>.
*   **Paid Newsletter**: A tiered model could be implemented, offering a free weekly version and a paid version with daily updates or more exclusive content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.

## Acquisition Strategies

### 1. Leveraging Twitter Threads
Twitter threads can be a highly effective way to acquire initial users for a TikTok format newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.
*   **Content**: Create threads detailing "the five formats that are going viral on TikTok this week," breaking down each one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
*   **Call to Action**: At the end of the thread, include a call to action to "join my email newsletter to get these daily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.
*   This strategy mimics successful content creators who break down viral trends and content mixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>.

### 2. Learning from Existing Success
*   **Mobile App Downloads**: TikTok has proven effective for driving [[viral_content_creation_with_tik_tok | mobile app downloads]], with one example showing 0 to 100,000 App Store downloads in 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. This demonstrates the platform's power in user acquisition.
*   **Adaptation**: The key is to figure out what works on a specific platform and do more of that, constantly iterating and reinventing strategies based on data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.

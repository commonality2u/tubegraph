The following article details a strategic framework for [[building_an_online_audience_and_achieving_high_impressions | building an online audience]], known as the ACP framework, along with a four-step playbook for its implementation in 2025. This approach emphasizes an "audience-first" strategy, distinguishing it from traditional "product-first" models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that his personal X (formerly Twitter) account has achieved 171 million impressions, nearly 900,000 bookmarks, and 100,000 shares in the last 12 months, driving millions of dollars to his businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He attributes this success to the detailed framework and playbook described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The ACP Framework: Audience, Community, Product

The core philosophy is the ACP framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>:
*   **A - Audience**: People in your niche who are passionate about a topic and underserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:09">[01:56:09]</a>.
*   **C - Community**: Your hardcore followers and supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:04">[02:01:04]</a>.
*   **P - Product**: What you sell to those people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>.

The recommended approach is to start with the Audience, then build the Community, and finally develop the Product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

> "The product first approach works for some people but the audience first approach gives you so many options also gives you so much confidence when you release something and people actually use it like there's nothing more Soul destroying than launching something and zero people are using it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:05">[02:33:05]</a>
> "For a bootstrap business starting with the audience just is the most like you just that that's what you have to do it doesn't make sense to do it the other way around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>
> "Dig the well before you need the water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>

The [[importance_of_organic_growth_and_audience_building | audience-first approach]] allows you to understand your audience and community better, leading to a superior product and a more indispensable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>. It's particularly crucial for bootstrapped businesses to prioritize organic attention over paid methods initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

## The Four-Step Playbook for Building an Audience in 2025

This playbook is designed to guide audience growth and has taken 15 years to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

### Step 1: Identify Your Audience and Stand Out

*   **Identify who you're creating for**: Focus on a specific niche. For example, people interested in startup ideas and building them with the ACP framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   **Understand what they're not getting from others**: This is about finding your unique "sauce" or differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. It could mean not holding anything back and freely sharing valuable insights and playbooks, even if it creates potential competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. In a competitive landscape, differentiating yourself is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
*   **Broaden your niche if engagement is low**: If you're not getting engagement, your niche might be too small. Start one level broader to gain reach, then specialize later. For instance, a company wanting to be known for "design sprints" (a niche topic) broadened to "UX design" (a popular, broader topic) on YouTube to gain traction before funneling users to their specific offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

### Step 2: Figure Out Your Format

A format is the style and presentation of your content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.
*   **Examples of formats**: Navel Ravikant's concise, philosophical "one-line Banger tweets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>, or long-form posts that provide extensive detail ("the sauce") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.
*   **Choosing a format**:
    *   **Look for formats outside your niche**: Avoid copying what's saturated in your space to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Consider what's working platform-wide**: For example, short-form video is performing well in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.
    *   **Focus on what feels natural and enjoyable**: This ensures consistency, which is vital for long-term content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.
*   **Testing formats**: Test different formats for 90 days and use platform analytics to determine what's working best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.
*   **Formats have life cycles**: Be aware that popular formats can decline in effectiveness, requiring constant reinvention and observation of new trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.

### Step 3: Implement Systems

Systems ensure consistency in your content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.
*   **Build your creative faucet routine**: Identify and cultivate what gets your creative juices flowing (e.g., following niche accounts, attending events, walks, podcasts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>.
*   **Have an ideas capture system**: Use a simple, accessible tool like Apple Notes to jot down content ideas (tweets, videos, newsletters) as they come to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>.
*   **Set weekly time to turn ideas into content**: Treat your content (tweets, podcasts, newsletters) as minimum viable products. Dedicate specific time each week to develop your captured ideas into publishable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>. Utilize scheduling tools to automate posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.
*   **Be strategic with timing**:
    *   Match platform timing to audience behavior and mindset (e.g., don't post on LinkedIn at 3 AM on a Saturday) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>.
    *   Post when topics are relevant and trending ("newsjacking") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>.

### Step 4: Pick One Primary Goal

*   **Define a clear, measurable goal**: Focus on one specific objective, such as gaining 100,000 followers in 12 months, building a 25,000-person email list, or achieving a million dollars in social sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:00">[24:47:00]</a>.
*   **Measure effectiveness against this goal**: Track your progress every 30, 60, or 90 days using platform analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>.
*   **Treat content like a product**: Approach content creation with the same rigor you'd bring to a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19:00">[25:19:00]</a>.
*   **Optimize for your goal, not vanity metrics**: While subscriber counts are common, focus on metrics that align with your primary goal, such as positive comments or engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>.

## General Advice for [[Benefits of Building an Audience for Business and Personal Growth | Audience Building]]

    *   It offers clarity into your niche, understanding audience motivations and incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>.
    *   It provides a group of people you can tap into for potential customers, beta users, or even job opportunities in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:08:00">[37:08:00]</a>.
    *   It functions as an "insurance policy" or "retirement account" for your career and finances, offering predictability and options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:00">[36:31:00]</a>.
    *   Even a small, niche audience can generate significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:57:00">[40:57:00]</a>.
*   **Start with replies on X (Twitter)**: For those feeling overwhelmed, X is an excellent platform to experiment with formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:52:00">[28:52:00]</a>. Being a "reply guy" by actively engaging with others' content can provide a confidence boost and dopamine hits, and helps experiment with formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>.

    > "Stop trying to be original sometimes just doing like bands that are successful often started out as cover bands and the more covers that they played the more like the more it became their own thing and it's like he said it's like an imperfect mirror so even if you try to copy someone you're going to do that in an imperfect way that makes your version special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17:00">[44:17:00]</a>

Hunter Isacson, a creator of consumer apps with over 300 million downloads, shares his playbook for achieving significant growth, including reaching $1 million MRR in the consumer app space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. His apps include NGL, which garnered 250 million downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, and other apps totaling 60 million downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Isacson emphasizes that it's possible to build a startup and generate real revenue in the consumer mobile app space without necessarily raising venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Core Principles for [[using_organic_growth_for_mobile_apps | Organic Growth]]

### 1. Build a Simple Experience (MVP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>
Start with a bare-bones Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that is sufficient to solve the core problem, even if it's rough around the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. The goal is to get a product out quickly to test its core concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

### 2. Build a Brand People Love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>
Isacson's apps (Wink, NGL, Bags) feature simple names with brands that resonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   **Use slang**: For "Bags," leveraging crypto community slang for the app's name, "bags.fm," was a smart strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.
*   **Keep it short and obvious**: NGL stands for "Not Gonna Lie," making it easy for young people to understand the app's anonymous nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. The brand should be easily understandable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.
*   **Authenticity**: Maintain an authentic voice and stance in public communication, making the brand relatable, memeable, and funny. This increases affinity and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

### 3. Get Users On Quickly (Seed the App) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>
*   **Test content early**: Even during pre-order, test content on platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels to gauge user response to the app's formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.
*   **Initial seeding**: Use [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_apps | creators]] and platforms like TikTok and Instagram to get an initial group of users to download the app quickly, activating a growth loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. For NGL, less than $10,000 was spent on marketing to achieve a quarter billion downloads, primarily for seeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Continued seeding**: Once the core action is proven, apply more pressure by seeding in different audiences, niches, countries, and time zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

### 4. Select a Core Action (Northstar Metric) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>
Define a single metric that matters more than others, guiding all product decisions and trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. The goal is to achieve a very high percentage (over 90%) of users completing this core action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
*   **Wink**: The Northstar metric was the percentage of users who get a match on their first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **NGL**: The core metric was the percentage of users sharing the link and a few replies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. This was critical as it trained users on a new Instagram feature and made others comfortable sending messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
*   **Bags**: The core metric is how many people fund their accounts and make one trade on the first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

### 5. Integrate Sharing/Inviting into the Core Action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>
Part of the core action should involve some form of sharing or inviting to leverage the app's virality and reduce reliance on external marketing channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **NGL**: The core action was sharing the NGL link on Instagram or Snapchat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.
*   **Bags**: Users log in with Twitter, claim their Bags link, and share it. A leaderboard tracked invites, creating a community loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

### 6. Reuse Old Ideas in New Channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>
It's not necessary to reinvent the wheel. Existing ideas can work in new channels or with new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   **NGL**: Anonymous messaging apps existed (Ask FM, Yik Yak), but NGL leveraged Instagram's new link feature for widespread access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Pangu**: Virtual pets existed (Tamagotchi), but Pangu injected a new degree of AI into the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   **Calai**: Calorie tracking existed, but it was made "AI first" by packaging publicly available AI tools nicely with good onboarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

> [!tip] Framework over Ideas
> Focus on looking for frameworks (e.g., "NGL for X", "Calai for X") rather than solely new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. This allows applying a successful format to different niches or audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

### 7. Leverage New Platform Real Estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>
Be observant for new features or "real estate" provided by operating systems (like iOS) that can be used for social or interactive experiences.
*   **Locket**: Was among the first to successfully leverage the iPhone's widget functionality to make it social, sending photos to a friend's home screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Live Activities**: A cool Apple feature that few are fully utilizing; it displays real-time updates on the lock screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Lock Screen Widgets**: Have not been fully explored, especially for social experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

### Calai (AI App) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>
*   **Concept**: Calorie tracking app utilizing publicly available AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Success Factor**: Excellent packaging, good onboarding, and user investment in the onboarding experience made a simple tool seem more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. They also effectively married creators with the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Hallow (Christian/Catholic Prayer App) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   **Concept**: Number one app for Christian and Catholic prayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Success Factor**: Modernized religious content for younger audiences (millennials, Gen Z) by making the Bible mobile, digital, colorful, and adding push notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Offers yearly plans and a friends and family plan for up to six members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Engagement**: Features a strong single-player experience with daily prayers, sleep meditations, and minute meditations, encouraging daily use. It also includes a multiplayer experience through community challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Future Opportunities**: Isacson sees a huge opening for similar apps across all religions, by taking existing faiths and turning them into engaging mobile experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. An "AI-first" version could use GPT Vision for content creation (e.g., overlaying Bible quotes on scenery) or generating answers from religious texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Locket (Social Widget App) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>
*   **Concept**: First app to make the iPhone widget functionality social by allowing users to send pictures directly to friends' home screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Success Factor**: Popped off on TikTok, appealing to relationship and best friend niches, skewing super young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. It identified and capitalized on a new opportunity within Apple's ecosystem (widgets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### NGL (Anonymous Messaging App) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>
*   **Concept**: Anonymous messaging app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Success Factor**: Launched when Instagram enabled link sharing for all users (October 2021), creating a new growth channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. The team quickly built and shipped the app in a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Minimal marketing spend ($10,000) was used to seed the app, allowing its inherent viral loop to take over once enough users adopted it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. The core challenge was training hundreds of millions of people on how to use the new Instagram link feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

### Bags (Crypto App) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>

Implemented growth loops early on, such as logging in with Twitter, claiming a "bags link," sharing it, and tracking invites on a leaderboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. This strategy generated hype and followers before the product was fully built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

### Pangu (Virtual Pet AI App) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>
*   **Concept**: An AI-powered virtual pet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.
*   **Success Factor**: Reimagined the classic virtual pet concept by injecting advanced AI for a more human-like experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>. This highlights the potential of applying new technology to existing popular ideas.

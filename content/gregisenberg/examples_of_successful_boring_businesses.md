Many wealthy individuals achieve their fortunes by building seemingly [[starting_a_boring_business_for_success | boring]], "sweaty" businesses that provide essential services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These enterprises often involve physical work and may not appear as glamorous as tech or AI startups, but they offer significant opportunities for wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Wealthy people frequently get rich through ventures like underground utilities, surveying companies, HVAC businesses, and real estate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Nick Huber's Experience with Boring Businesses
Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," highlights that increasing one's odds of becoming wealthy often involves pursuing "normal," [[starting_a_boring_business_for_success | boring]] business ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Storage Squad
[[nick_hubers_experience_with_boring_businesses | Nick Huber]]'s personal journey to making a million dollars began with a pickup and delivery storage business called Storage Squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This business focused on storing students' boxes in a warehouse during the summer and delivering them back when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Revenue and Profit**: At its peak, Storage Squad generated approximately $2.2 million in annual revenue, with $400,000-$500,000 in annual profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: The primary and most effective marketing method was sidewalk chalk, strategically placed where students walked, lived, and attended classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Nick personally wrote the ad "Need storage squad.com. $29.99 per box all summer" over 5,000 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping**: The business was bootstrapped using old, rusty cargo vans bought for $1,500 and box trucks for $2,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Profitability**: The business was profitable from day one, with Nick making $3,000 cash within three weeks of starting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Exit**: The business was sold in 2020 for $1.75 million with no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Self-Storage Facilities
Leveraging his experience, [[nick_hubers_experience_with_boring_businesses | Nick Huber]] and his partner ventured into self-storage real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Erie, Pennsylvania Facility**: They bought a 40,000+ square foot facility with 180+ units at a public auction for $625,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The neglected property was making only $4,000 a month in revenue with over a hundred abandoned units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **North Georgia Facility**: Another facility in North Georgia was purchased for $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Its revenue increased from $15,600 to $40,000 a month, and its value rose to $4.5 million without any spectacular innovations or external funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Other Examples of Successful Boring Businesses
Nick Huber shared several [[sweaty_startups_and_unconventional_opportunities | sweaty startup]] ideas and real-world examples:

### Lawn Care Company
[[examples_of_effective_marketing_strategies_with_funnels | Nick Huber]]'s brother runs a successful lawn care company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: His sole marketing strategy is "bandit signs" placed on the side of the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Results**: This generates 30-40 new customers annually in April/May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, leading to a 30% annual growth and over $100,000 in profit while allowing him to spend two months fishing in the winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Mobile Detailing Business
A friend named Jack runs "Detailed Dogs," a mobile detailing service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Profitability**: In October 2024, the business generated $17,000 in revenue with $10,000 in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, indicating an annual income of approximately $120,000 for a one-year college graduate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### High-End Airport Transportation
A friend named Jude operates a high-end transportation service to the airport with three other drivers in Atlanta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This business is described as doing "really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### Firewood Delivery with Custom Racks
This idea involves building custom firewood racks on-site for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Profit Potential**: While unseasoned firewood delivery costs $300-$400, building and delivering seasoned firewood in a custom rack could command $800-$1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This allows for potential profit of $1,000 in a day by completing two deliveries, equating to over $100 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Recurring Revenue**: This service could be structured as a subscription, with twice-yearly refills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Expansion**: It serves as an entry point for offering additional services like lawn mowing, snow clearing, or tree work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Local Bar TV Advertising
An individual in North Georgia operates a business that displays rotating ads on TVs in bars and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Model**: He has 70 bars and restaurants on his plan, charging businesses $10 a month for an ad that flashes for 7 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Profit**: This generates a net profit of $20,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The service also fosters loyalty between local businesses and the bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### Putting Green Installation
This is a higher-skilled business involving the installation of turf putting greens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Profit Potential**: Projects can range from $30,000 to $200,000 for high-end residential installs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Tree Removal
Despite being difficult and risky due to injury potential and the need for expensive equipment and skilled employees, tree removal is a highly lucrative business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Example**: Two guys spent four hours removing two trees and were paid over $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, demonstrating significant hourly earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

### Christmas Light Installation
While involving risk, this service can be very profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Example**: Friends spend $3,500-$4,000 to have a few rows of Christmas lights installed for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### Other Service-Based Businesses
Additional [[sweaty_startups_and_unconventional_opportunities | sweaty startup]] ideas with potential include:
*   Deck building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>
*   Power washing (low skill, low money entry point) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>
*   Concrete work (driveway slabs, patios) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>
*   Bounce house rentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>

### Nanny Recruiting / Night Nurse Service (Proposed Idea)
This idea targets high-value customers (new parents) and leverages their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Problem**: Difficulty in finding specialized caregivers like night nurses through general marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Solution**: Create a dedicated directory like "nightnurses.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The domain is available for $13,000 or $1,100/month for 13 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   **Service Model**: A proposed model involves charging a one-time fee of $1,000 to find, vet, background check, and set up interviews for night nurses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.
*   **Revenue Potential**: Could place 20+ nurses a month, generating $20,000+ in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.
*   **Leverage**: Once established, this [[business_in_a_box_concepts | business in a box]] could expand into related services like nanny recruiting, or even a fintech/AI payroll provider for caregivers, built on the foundation of the sweaty startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: Localized marketing, like handing out flyers or using bandit signs in specific neighborhoods where pregnant women gather, could be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Advertising on popular pregnancy apps could also reach the target demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

## Advantages of Boring Businesses Over Tech Startups
[[advantages_of_boring_businesses_over_tech_startups | Boring businesses]] offer distinct advantages over high-flying tech or AI startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Lower Competition**: Instead of competing against highly funded Stanford computer science graduates with vast networks, entrepreneurs can compete against local businesses that may be less sophisticated (e.g., using fax machines, not answering phones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. This significantly increases the odds of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Higher Probability of Profitability**: While most tech startups, especially AI ones, fail (estimated 93-99% will not reach profitability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>, boring businesses offer a much higher chance of generating consistent income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Stability**: These businesses are often less susceptible to rapid technological shifts or venture capital whims.
*   **Tool, not Replacement**: AI, like the invention of the lawnmower, will likely become a tool that makes existing business owners more money and reduces labor, rather than replacing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

## The Value of Domains as Digital Real Estate
A good domain name is crucial for any business, serving as its digital real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   **Investment**: Investing in a strong, memorable `.com` domain can be an "unbelievable investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. For example, Nick Huber spent $450,000 on somewhere.com and gained more than that in value within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
*   **Increased Leads**: A clear domain can lead to more organic traffic and leads. For instance, if a lead is worth $300, getting 10 extra leads a month (totaling $3,000) would more than cover the cost of a $1,100/month domain lease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
*   **Brand Recognition**: Easily spelled and remembered domains are vital for brand recognition and avoiding the need for paid ads just to be found (e.g., Beehive's struggles with its non-intuitive domain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   **AI Prioritization**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are likely to prioritize `.com` domains over others like `.io`, further emphasizing their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

## Conclusion
The path to wealth doesn't always involve high-tech innovation; it often lies in identifying and effectively executing [[brainstorming_startup_ideas_for_1m_businesses | ideas]] within [[starting_a_boring_business_for_success | boring]] yet essential service industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. These "sweaty startups" offer clear opportunities for profitability, often with lower competition and less reliance on external funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. By understanding demand, implementing effective (often low-cost) marketing, and focusing on operational excellence, entrepreneurs can build substantial wealth through these overlooked avenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.

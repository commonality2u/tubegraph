"Boring, sweaty businesses" are those that deal with tangible tasks like cleaning, moving, or repairing things for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. These types of ventures are often overlooked in favor of high-tech startups, yet many wealthy individuals build their fortunes through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. These "normal" and "boring" businesses can lead to significant wealth and increased odds of getting rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Common Industries for Building Wealth
Many wealthy individuals in towns, including those with private jets and large beach houses, have succeeded in "boring" industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>:
*   Underground utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   Surveying companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
*   HVAC businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   Real estate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>

## Nick Huber's Journey: Storage Squad
Nick Huber, known as "Mr. Sweaty Startup," shares his personal experience and provides examples of successful boring businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. His first venture was a pickup and delivery storage business called Storage Squad, which is still operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Concept**: Storing students' boxes in a warehouse during summer breaks and returning them when students moved back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Growth**: At its peak, Storage Squad generated approximately $2.2 million in annual revenue, with a profit of $400,000-$500,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: The primary marketing method, until reaching over $2 million in revenue in 2017, was sidewalk chalk advertising. This involved writing the business's name and offer ("Need storage squad.com. $29.99 per box all summer") thousands of times in areas where customers walked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Operations**: The business was bootstrapped, starting with a $1,500 cargo van bought on Craigslist and a $2,200 box truck from a repair shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. It stored over 5,000 boxes for more than 2,000 students in a 35,000 sq ft warehouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Sale**: The business was sold in 2020 for $1.75 million, with no debt, and the profits were split between Nick and his partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Origin**: The idea originated when someone, responding to Nick's Craigslist ad for leasing his apartment, instead asked to store their belongings in his apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This led to Nick realizing he could profit by storing other people's items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The business was profitable from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Self-Storage Facilities
Building on the success of Storage Squad, Nick and his partner expanded into self-storage:
*   **Erie, Pennsylvania Facility**: In 2019, they bought a 40,000+ sq ft, 180+ unit self-storage facility at public auction for $625,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The previous owner had neglected it, making only about $4,000 a month and leaving over a hundred abandoned units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **North Georgia Facility**: Another self-storage facility in North Georgia was purchased for $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. When acquired, it generated $15,600-$16,000 per month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Today, its revenue is $40,000 per month and it is valued at $4.5 million, a $2 million increase in value without "anything spectacular" or raising money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Other Sweaty Startup Examples
*   **Lawn Care Company**: Nick's brother runs a lawn care company that uses bandit signs (roadside signs) as its only marketing. It gains 30-40 new customers annually in April/May. He made over $100,000 last year and spent two months fishing in the Florida Keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Mobile Detailing Business**: Jack, a college graduate, runs "Detailed Dogs," a mobile detailing service. In October 2024, he reported $17,000 in revenue and $10,000 in profit, annualizing to $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **High-End Transportation**: Jude, a friend, offers high-end airport transportation with three other drivers in Atlanta and is doing "really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Firewood Delivery**: A business that builds on-site firewood storage structures (costing ~$100 in materials and 1.5 hours to build) and delivers seasoned firewood for $800-$1,000. This could yield $1,000 profit daily by doing two deliveries, translating to over $100 an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This could also be a [[microsaas_business_ideas | subscription service]] with recurring revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> and an entry point to other services like lawn mowing, snow clearing, or tree work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **In-Bar TV Advertising**: A business operating in North Georgia places rotating ads on TVs in 70 local bars and restaurants. It charges businesses $10 per month and nets $20,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Putting Green Installation**: A higher-skilled business that can make $30,000 to $200,000 on high-end turf installations at residential properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Tree Removal**: A difficult but lucrative business due to high customer payments. Two workers spent four hours removing two trees for $3,000+, demonstrating high hourly earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Christmas Light Installation**: While risky due to heights, individuals can make "really good money," with some clients spending $3,500-$4,000 for a few rows of lights for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Power Washing**: An accessible business requiring low skill and minimal money to start, involving cleaning concrete, furniture, and decks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Concrete Work**: Includes driveway slabs and patios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Bounce House Rentals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Nanny/Night Nurse Recruiting (Startup Idea)
A proposed [[startup_ideas_for_profitable_service_businesses | profitable service business startup idea]] involves a local nanny recruiting company, specifically for night nurses, addressing a market gap identified by the host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Problem**: Difficulty finding a dedicated platform for night nurses, as existing services like Care.com are too broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Proposed Solution**: A dedicated domain like nightnurses.com (available for $13,000 or lease-to-own for $1,100/month for 13 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This could be a "sweaty digital business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
*   **Business Model**:
    *   **Directory**: Build a directory, potentially using AI, to gain organic traffic through blogs, product reviews, and mom advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
    *   **Recruitment Service**: Offer a premium service for a one-time fee of $1,000, where the company posts job ads, networks, vets candidates (background checks, interviews), and presents only the highest-qualified options to families. Once a nurse is hired, the family pays them directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.
    *   **Marketing**: Advertise on pregnancy tracking apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>, start locally with flyers, bandit signs, or even sidewalk chalk in areas frequented by expecting mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   **Scalability**: Placing 20-29 nurses a month could generate $20,000 in monthly revenue to build upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. The high-value customers acquired early in their journey offer opportunities for cross-selling other baby/family-related services or products through affiliate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

## The Advantage of Boring Businesses
Choosing to pursue "boring" businesses, also known as [[blue_collar_startup_ideas | blue collar startup ideas]], offers several strategic advantages over high-tech startups:
*   **Competition**: Instead of competing with highly funded, brilliant tech entrepreneurs, one can compete against established local businesses that might be inefficient (e.g., using fax machines, not answering phones, poor management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. This increases the odds of winning in a market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.
*   **Profitability**: While AI startups are abundant, a significant majority (93-99%) are unlikely to reach profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. Boring businesses offer a higher probability of making consistent money, even if the "win" is smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.
*   **AI as a Tool**: AI is seen as a tool that will empower existing business owners, rather than necessarily creating profitable AI-specific companies. Just as the lawn mower made lawn care companies more efficient and profitable, AI can make "boring" businesses more efficient and increase their owners' earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

Boring businesses can serve as the "sweaty startup" foundation for future tech integration. For example, a successful night nurse directory could later integrate payroll or other fintech solutions, transforming into a "fintech AI company" built on a strong, "sweaty" customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

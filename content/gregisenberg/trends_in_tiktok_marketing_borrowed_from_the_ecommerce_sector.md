Joseph Choy highlights that many consumer apps are achieving millions of downloads by mastering TikTok, which he describes as an "underpriced distribution channel" due to the low cost of content creation and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. These successful [[strategies_for_organic_growth_of_consumer_apps_using_tiktok | strategies]] for consumer apps are largely being adapted from the e-commerce space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

## E-commerce Tactics Driving Consumer App Growth

The space for [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_apps | TikTok marketing innovation]] is relatively new, with TikTok Shop only launching in November 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Joseph Choy observes that many of the successful tactics employed by e-commerce brands can be directly applied to consumer apps, offering higher margins and exit multiples for software businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

### Mass User-Generated Content (UGC) Creation

A prime example from e-commerce is Tabs Chocolate, which scaled from zero to $10 million annually by employing mass UGC creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. They achieved this by hiring numerous teenagers, coordinating them in a Discord server, and mass-producing content daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. The founder of Tabs Chocolate later pivoted to a micro-SaaS product for college homework, applying the same [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_software_companies | marketing tactics]] to a software business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

### Viral Content Formats

Viral [[viral_tiktok_formats_and_templates | content formats]] are key to success, often leveraging AI and specific hooks:

*   **AI-Generated Slideshows/Carousels**: Contrary to the common perception of TikTok as a short-form video platform, carousels (slideshows) are proving highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.
    *   **E-commerce Example**: A colostrum product used AI-generated images (Midjourney) and repurposed audio (e.g., Joe Rogan clips) for a "POV you divorced bread" hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. These videos can go viral daily, driving significant traffic to Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
    *   **App Example**: The POV app, a disposable camera app, uses similar slideshows with a "wedding angle" and AI-generated faces (Midjourney) to promote its utility for guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Advantages**: Slideshows are easier to create than videos, have a lower barrier to entry, and offer greater scalability, despite potentially lower conversion rates than human-led talking-head videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
*   **Talking Head Videos and the TikTok Shop Affiliate Center**: TikTok Shop enables e-commerce brands to upload products and allows creators to sign up as affiliates, earning an automatic cut (typically 15-20%) without formal contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Challenge**: Large brands like Goalies (a supplement company) have created a "gold rush" by offering extreme incentives (MacBook Pro for $7,000 GMV, Rolex for $45,000, Tesla for $500,000) on top of affiliate commissions, making it difficult for smaller brands to compete for top talking-head creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. This competitive landscape pushes new entrants towards slideshows due to less creator monopolization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

### Leveraging E-commerce Creators for App Promotion

A key insight is to use the TikTok Shop Affiliate Center to identify high-performing e-commerce creators who excel at generating views and converting sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. The opportunity lies in having these creators promote apps instead of just e-commerce products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

*   **Strategy**: Develop an app that either helps these creators sell their existing e-commerce products better or addresses a related pain point within their niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Example**: For skincare influencers, create a skincare app that analyzes faces for before/after comparisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>. The influencer could use the app as a utility within their content, showing the interface casually, leading to organic downloads from curious viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>. This provides free marketing as the app helps them make their existing content more engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits of Apps over E-commerce Products**: Apps generally have a lower price point, making it easier for users to make impulse purchases via features like "double tap to pay" on iOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>. Apps also offer zero cost of goods and infinite scalability, allowing for high volume and higher margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:00]</a>. Subscriptions are a major driver of revenue for "single utility apps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.

## Targeting High-Value Niches with Underpriced Audiences

While TikTok's user base is generally young, there's a wide range of demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>. Targeting specific niches with less creator competition can yield significant returns due to underpriced content reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>.

*   **Golf**: Golfers are a demographic willing to pay more for products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Opportunity**: [[ai_trends_and_trend_analysis_for_startups | AI]]-powered golf swing analysis apps that use a phone's camera to analyze swing mechanics and offer tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24:00">[23:24:00]</a>. This provides a convenient and affordable alternative to expensive in-person coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>.
    *   **Visual Strategy**: Apps like KO (an MMA training app) use a wireframe skeleton overlay during product demos to visually analyze movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>. This "wow factor" is highly effective on TikTok and can be applied to other sports like tennis or pickleball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>. The recent development of GPT Vision makes such [[ai_trends_and_trend_analysis_for_startups | AI-driven analysis]] more accessible using standard smartphone cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:00">[28:25:00]</a>.
*   **Poker**: An under-monetized niche with high lifetime value (LTV) users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Opportunity**: Apps that help poker players analyze hand histories, strategies, or offer educational tips for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:47:00">[29:47:00]</a>. Many existing poker content creators on TikTok are unmonetized or only sell courses/promote gambling sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>. Integrating an app's interface briefly into gameplay videos can drive curious viewers to download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:00">[31:11:00]</a>.

## The Evolving Role of Influencer Marketing on TikTok

Traditional [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_apps | influencer marketing]] from the Instagram era, where brands pay influencers with large audiences, is different on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:00">[33:13:00]</a>.

*   **For You Page Algorithm**: TikTok's "For You Page" algorithm prioritizes content quality over an influencer's existing audience, as 95% of content consumed is from new accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:47:00">[33:47:00]</a>.
*   **Creator Roles**: On TikTok, creators embody three roles: actor, director (creating the video), and possessing a built-in audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a>.
*   **New Approach**: Brands can "cut out" the director and audience roles and hire creators purely as "actors" or talent in videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>. These creators can have zero followers and simply make content on a new brand account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:46:00">[35:46:00]</a>. This makes influencer marketing cheaper and more scalable, as evidenced by Tabs Chocolate and Airbuds creating multiple brand accounts for different creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>.
*   **Algorithm Optimization**: When a content format works and is scalable, creating new accounts dedicated to that specific format (e.g., Locks Club's "how to find a nice Jewish boy in NYC" series) helps the algorithm serve content more effectively to the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:57:00">[38:57:00]</a>. Too many different content faces/formats on one account can confuse the algorithm and hurt reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:19:00">[40:19:00]</a>.

## Tapping into "Cult-Like" Movements for App Growth

Leveraging existing "cult-like" movements or deeply ingrained ideologies can lead to significant business opportunities. This aligns with the idea that the best businesses are often "cult-like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:26:00">[46:26:00]</a>.

*   **Looksmaxing (Relationships/Self-Improvement)**: The "looksmaxing" movement, focused on improving physical appearance (especially among young men), started in niche internet communities but has gone mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:16:00">[41:16:00]</a>.
    *   **App Example**: Umax, an app that scans a user's face, provides scores, and offers tips to improve features like jawline, skin, and hair, has capitalized on this movement to generate millions in revenue, primarily through TikTok distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>.
*   **Wealth Creation (Wealth)**: The desire for wealth is a strong motivator.
    *   **App Example**: Crayo, a SaaS product, partnered with YouTubers and TikTokers who teach teenagers how to make money by clipping streamer content for YouTube shorts and TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:36:00">[44:36:00]</a>. Crayo productizes this course, offering software to automate video creation, promoting the software instead of just the course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:22:00">[45:22:00]</a>. This taps into the "cult of money" or "cult of young money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:56:00">[45:56:00]</a>.

### Importance of Product Quality

While distribution [[strategies_for_organic_growth_of_consumer_apps_using_tiktok | strategies]] are crucial, a strong product is the baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:54:00">[46:54:00]</a>. Before scaling distribution, ensuring the app is high-quality, retains users, and has good product-led growth metrics is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:16:00">[47:16:00]</a>. Knowing user lifetime value (LTV) and customer acquisition cost (CAC) derived from product retention metrics allows for more effective marketing spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:42:00">[47:42:00]</a>. Without retention, marketing becomes a "leaky bucket," effectively turning a scalable app into a one-time e-commerce product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:15:00">[48:15:00]</a>.

David Park successfully scaled his AI startup, Jenny AI, from zero to $10 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. He shared his comprehensive playbook, detailing [[growth_hacking_with_ai_applications | growth hacking with AI applications]] through various channels including paid ads, SEO strategies, and influencer marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Organic Short-Form Content

The landscape of social media has shifted, where traditional clout like millions of followers or checkmarks is no longer the primary indicator of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Fresh Accounts vs. Established Accounts
A single video posted on a completely new TikTok account can instantly go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. In A/B tests at Jenny AI, content posted on accounts with as few as 50 followers sometimes outperformed the same content on their main account with 70,000 followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The algorithm now has the potential to blast content to millions if it resonates, regardless of follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

AI products are inherently spectacular, making them ideal for short-form video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This allows creators to make visually pleasing content that attracts attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Sponsoring Accounts
It is advisable to sponsor a fresh account (even one made this week) over a YouTuber with a million subscribers if they have similar view counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This is because fresh accounts are often algorithmically "juiced" and are on an upward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Additionally, fresh accounts are significantly cheaper to sponsor (potentially 1/100th the price), as established YouTubers expect high fees (e.g., $20,000 for a 30-second video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Creating Your Own Accounts
Instead of just sponsoring new accounts, businesses can create these accounts themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Partner with a creator to be the "face" of your product on a new, fresh account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This allows the creator to avoid "polluting" their main account with too many ads, making it a win-win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### Case Study: Ming May Duck and Jenny AI
David Park partnered with Ming May Duck, who had around 300,000 TikTok followers at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Ming May Duck was paid $4,000 per month for 20 videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The collaboration started with a fresh account from scratch and grew to 70,000 followers, generating approximately half a billion views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. In the first month alone, they achieved 7 million impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This approach yielded a good return on investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The deal was typically for short commitments, such as three months, which provides flexibility for the startup to test the channel and consistent revenue for the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

### Content Strategy
*   **Frequency:** Post at least one video per day to maximize experimentation and find winning content angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. This allows for rapid iteration, testing different hooks, formats (skits, memes, educational), and on-screen text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.
*   **Viral Series:** The goal is to identify a "viral series" â€“ a video format that goes viral once and can be replicated with minimal changes to consistently achieve high views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. Humans are creatures of habit and enjoy seeing familiar content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Changing the material being tested (spaghetti, coat hangers, paper, iPads) in a strength test video maintains virality with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.
    *   *Jenny AI Example:* The "POV: you have a paper or an essay due" series involved a relatable hook (realizing an essay is due at an inconvenient time) followed by the product solution, consistently going viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This series generated over 300 million views overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
*   **Format-Product Fit:** Ensure the viral format aligns with your product to avoid "empty calories" from virality without conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. A video with 20 million views had a negligible effect on Jenny AI's conversions because it lacked product fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.
*   **Scaling Content:**
    1.  Start with experimentation to find a viral video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
    2.  Turn that viral video into a series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
    3.  Tweak and post the series on multiple accounts and platforms (Reels, TikTok, Shorts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. At its peak, Jenny AI had seven accounts on each platform, posting 24 videos daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
    4.  Translate and create the same video series with creators in different languages (e.g., Chinese, Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
    5.  Sponsor other pages (e.g., Instagram meme pages) to repost viral videos for a second life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.
    6.  Use mega-viral content for [[marketing_and_user_acquisition_for_ai_startups | paid ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
    7.  Be aware that content series eventually get played out as competitors copy them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

## Influencer Marketing

### Finding Influencers
The most effective way to find influencers is by asking your target users who they follow and then analyzing their social media handles to see who they actually interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

*   **"Suggested Similar Accounts" Hack:** Once you have a list of initial influencers, click on their profiles and explore "suggested similar accounts" on platforms like Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.
*   **Algorithm Hack:** Create a new Instagram or TikTok account and manually follow all your target influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. Watch their videos all the way through, and the algorithm will automatically start showing you other relevant influencers in the same niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>. This strategy helps find "crazy deals" with new creators who are receptive to partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. If an influencer's video appears on your "For You Page" when you aren't following them, it indicates their content has the capacity to be pushed to non-follower accounts, which increases your potential upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

### Reaching Out to Influencers
*   **Multi-Channel Approach:** Use all available avenues: DMs, emails, LinkedIn, and even obscure blogs or Tumblrs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. Finding less obvious contact methods can impress them, showing you're not just mass messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.
*   **Personalization & Conciseness:** Messages must be detailed and tailored, demonstrating you're a genuine fan of their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. Be concise; avoid paragraphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>.
*   **Human Connection:** Talk to them like a human, not just a business. Avoid talking about funding rounds or employee numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.
*   **Paid Promotion:** Clearly indicate that it is a paid promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. Influencers are constantly offered free products, so upfront mention of payment makes your offer serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>.
*   **Persistence:** Expect that a majority of messages will not receive a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. Develop tough skin and focus on optimizing your outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.
*   **Leverage:** As your product gains recognition and your social media accounts grow (e.g., 70,000 followers and a blue checkmark), it becomes easier to get responses from other creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.

### Negotiating with Influencers
*   **Align Incentives:** Structure payments so that a percentage is tied to conversions or views, ensuring both parties want a high-performing video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
*   **Transparency:** Be straightforward about your budget and expected ROI. Ask influencers to be transparent about their demographics and past sponsored video performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.
*   **Unbundle Services:** Start by asking for the most expensive package (e.g., Lincoln bio, Instagram story, all short-form accounts, full usage rights). Then, unbundle services you don't need to get to a fair, non-inflated price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
*   **Bulk Deals:** Once a fair price for a single video is established, propose a bulk deal (e.g., three videos per month) with a discount (e.g., 20% off) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **Ignore Follower-Based Pricing:** Do not pay based on follower count; pay based on actual reach and conversion potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

### Posting Influencer Content
*   **Tailored Approach:** Don't use a one-size-fits-all strategy. Content must align with the influencer's existing style and audience to maintain retention and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   **Trust the Influencer:** If you lack experience, trust the influencer to create content similar to their usual posts, integrating your product halfway through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
*   **Integrate into Series:** If an influencer has an existing popular series (e.g., "Top 10 AI tools that feel illegal to know"), ask to be included in that series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>.
*   **Scale and Autopilot:** To scale, reach a point where videos are going out every few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. This requires trusting influencers with a blueprint and expecting specific view or engagement metrics, rather than constant micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.
*   **Direct Ads:** Don't be afraid for a video to look like a straight-up ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. While it might get fewer views, it will convert better because it directly addresses a pain point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.
*   **Team Efficiency:** Jenny AI has two people managing influencer marketing, even while spending $50,000 to hundreds of thousands monthly, by efficiently setting expectations and letting creators "cook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>.

## [[seo_strategies_for_ai_startups | SEO Strategies for AI Startups]]

SEO should not be the first growth channel for a startup due to its delayed gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>. Early-stage companies need faster iteration cycles, which are better achieved through influencer marketing or user-generated content (UGC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.

*   **Featured Snippets:** Target pages with "featured snippets" in search results. By crafting the perfect answer to the query, you can potentially leapfrog many search rankings and immediately capture the snippet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.
*   **Leverage Influencer Marketing for SEO:** Most users who see content on platforms like TikTok do not click the link directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>. Instead, they often search for the product name on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. This increases your brand name searches, which Google interprets as legitimacy, passively boosting your SEO without direct effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.
*   **Focus on Buying Intent:** Prioritize keywords that indicate buying intent (e.g., "best tool possible") over those seeking free solutions (e.g., "free tool") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>.
*   **Later Stage Investment:** Invest heavily in SEO only after achieving product-market fit (PMF) and having a steady income stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. Jenny AI spends tens of thousands monthly on SEO, employing tactics like creating mini-tools, free tools, and landing pages in different languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>.

## Paid Ads

Similar to SEO, paid ads can be a "trap" for early-stage entrepreneurs due to the time required for learning phases, creative development, and the risk of being stuck in unprofitable customer acquisition cost (CAC) to lifetime value (LTV) ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.

*   **Reuse Organic Content:** If you've successfully used UGC or influencer marketing, you can reuse that organically proven content for paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>.
*   **Leverage Organic Data:** Data from social media partnerships provides valuable insights for better ad targeting from day one, including which countries convert better, LTV per country, and ideal user demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.
*   **Timing:** Early-stage startups typically lack the budget to spend enough on platforms like Meta to get sufficient data for purchase-conversion-based targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>. Jenny AI only started investing heavily in paid ads after establishing some semblance of product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>.
*   **Metrics:** Aim for a 3:1 LTV to CAC ratio and a short payback period (e.g., recovering acquisition cost within two months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. This allows for quick reinvestment of profits back into the best-performing acquisition channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>.

## Scaling from $5M to $10M ARR

The core [[strategies_for_building_ai_startups | strategies for building AI startups]] that drove growth from zero to $5 million ARR largely remain effective for scaling from $5 million to $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. While the granular details and scaling challenges change (e.g., hiring, building teams), the fundamental playbook still applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>.

Key additions and focus areas for later-stage growth include:
*   **Affiliate Marketing:** A significant portion of Jenny AI's revenue now comes from affiliate marketers who champion the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   **Acquisitions:** Acquiring other startups, particularly those with a strong revenue stream, can be a strategy for expansion and a hedge against future growth uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>. Jenny AI acquired a startup and doubled its revenue in five months by applying lessons learned from Jenny AI's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Back to Basics (Retention & Conversion):** Focus heavily on improving retention and conversion rates within the user funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>. Even small percentage improvements in churn rate have a massive impact at a larger scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>. Jenny AI notably reduced its churn from 20% to around 9.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. High churn (50%, 40%, 30% monthly) is common for B2C AI apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>.

David Park emphasizes that building a successful AI startup is achievable even for non-technical founders or college dropouts, encouraging others to "run this time" if they lock in and commit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.

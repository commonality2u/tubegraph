Reddit can be a powerful resource for discovering validated [[startup ideas from Reddit | startup ideas]] and [[identifying market opportunities and trends | market opportunities]] that can lead to multi-million dollar businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It's a place to find "gold" in terms of knowing what people resonate with before building a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This process involves leveraging [[tools for identifying trends and antitrends | AI tools]] to analyze community discussions and identify pain points and desired solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Power of Reddit for Validated Ideas

Reddit is a prime location for finding validated ideas because it surfaces existing communities and discussions around problems users face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The core idea is to "teleport" into different communities, observe, write down observations, and generate ideas that will resonate with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

## Step 1: Identifying Trending Subreddits with Gummy Search

The first step in finding new, validated ideas is to use a tool called Gummy Search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. It offers both free and paid plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Focusing on Growing Communities

Within Gummy Search, navigate to the "trending" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While you can view top subreddits by size or activity, the most crucial filter is "growing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The goal is to identify how fast a subreddit is growing daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

A common mistake is focusing solely on massive subreddits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Instead, concentrate on subreddits with 10,000 to 100,000 members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. These smaller, trending communities answer the "why now" question, indicating that a topic is newer, currently trending, and "in the Zeitgeist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Regularly checking Gummy Search every few weeks helps identify new niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

As you scroll through the trending list, ask yourself:
*   Is this interesting? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   Do I have an unfair advantage here? (e.g., personal connection, expertise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   Can I create something for this community? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>

Document potential ideas in a notebook or Google Doc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Curated Subreddits

Gummy Search also offers curated sections, such as a list of 26 subreddits for software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. While useful, the primary focus should remain on identifying rapidly growing communities for new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Step 2: Uncovering Problems and Solutions

Once a promising subreddit is identified (e.g., "dog food" subreddit), the next step is to find the specific problems and potential solutions within that community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Creating an Audience

In Gummy Search, you create an "audience" by adding the chosen subreddit and similar communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. For example, an "audience" named "people into dog food" could include multiple dog-related subreddits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Analyzing Pain and Anger

Gummy Search organizes discussions into categories like "pain and anger," "hot discussions," "advice requests," and "solution requests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. To find problems, focus on the "pain and anger" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Gummy Search uses AI to summarize thousands of submissions, identifying common patterns of pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Examples from the "dog food" audience include:
*   Potty training challenges with new or rehomed dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>
*   Dogs reluctant to walk outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>
*   Loss of a dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>
*   Eating habits and loss of appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>

These patterns immediately suggest [[reddit_as_a_source_for_business_ideas | business ideas]], whether for content, services, or products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. While competitive research is necessary, often existing solutions have poor marketing or lack a strong social presence, presenting opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Exploring Advice and Solution Requests

The "advice requests" category reveals what products or services people are actively seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. These are "people screaming they want these products to exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Examples include requests for dog breed recommendations or specific dog food for senior dogs with dental issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This can inspire ideas like a survey-based website recommending dog breeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

The "solution requests" section provides insights into the competitive landscape, showing what products and methods people are already using to address their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This helps understand the current market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Document all findings on a "one-pager" Google Doc to serve as a foundation for your business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## Step 3: Leveraging Creators for Deeper Insights

To further understand a niche, identify popular creators within that community.

### Finding Influencers with Perplexity.ai

Use Perplexity.ai (a free tool) to find top influencers or educational YouTubers in your chosen niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. For example, prompt it to list "top youtubeurs that are educational for dogs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Compile this list, perhaps in a Google Sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### Analyzing Creator Content Comments

Visit the YouTube channels of these creators and sort their videos by "most popular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Read the comments on these popular videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This allows you to "put yourself in their shoes" and understand what people are thinking about, their frustrations, and their desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Repeat this for 20-25 videos, adding insights to your one-pager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Step 4: Developing and Validating Concepts

### Wireframing and Prototyping

Based on the gathered insights, wireframe out a website or product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. For instance, if Reddit users express frustration with designers who prioritize aesthetics over conversion, you could wireframe a design agency focused on copy and conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Tools like Framer can help create a simple MVP (Minimum Viable Product) quickly, sometimes in just a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

### Crafting Catchy Names

A validated startup idea also needs a validated, catchy name that resonates with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Sometimes, a company name can even be derived from a subreddit's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. For example, the insight that designers should be "more like a scientist, less art, more science" led to the name "Design Science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Generating Content Ideas

The same methodology used for [[using_reddit_to_find_startup_ideas | startup ideas]] can be applied to content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. In Gummy Search, go to the "top content" section for your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   Observe the best-performing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.
*   Identify common patterns and working formats (e.g., long stories, memes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
*   Understand what the community cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   You can also ask questions within Gummy Search, for example, "do they love memes?" to get further insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

## The "Entrepreneurial Assistant"

Gummy Search and similar products act as an "entrepreneurial assistant" or co-founder, connecting dots within your brain by providing structured insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. This [[automated market research | automated market research]] process helps observe and generate ideas that resonate with specific communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

## Conclusion

This structured approach, using tools like Gummy Search and Perplexity.ai to dive deep into Reddit communities, has proven successful in building multi-million dollar businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. It's a systematic way to find validated ideas for products, services, and content by understanding the explicit needs and desires of specific online audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

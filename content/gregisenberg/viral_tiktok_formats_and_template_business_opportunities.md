The trend of viral formats on TikTok presents a significant opportunity for building online businesses [00:00:34]. The core idea revolves around people actively seeking out popular TikTok templates and formats that are currently experiencing viral growth [00:00:42].

## Business Opportunities & Strategies

### Identifying Viral Formats
The demand exists for easily accessible information on what [[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | viral formats]] and templates are currently performing well on TikTok [00:30:26]. This trend is evidenced by the high search volume, with 98,000 searches for "TikTok template" in a recent month [00:29:59].

### Newsletter Model
One immediate business idea is to create an email newsletter that curates and distributes currently [[viral_marketing_for_mobile_apps | viral TikTok]] formats and templates [00:30:33].
*   **Content:** The newsletter would inform subscribers about the formats going [[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | viral]] each week and provide guidance on how to adapt them for their own brands [00:30:41].
*   **Inspiration:** This concept is similar to "Memelord Technologies" and its daily email newsletter which provides [[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | viral meme templates]] [00:30:48]. Memelord also allows users a one-button click to jump into an editor and create their own versions [00:31:05].
*   **Acquisition Strategy:** Initial subscriber growth can be achieved through Twitter threads [00:31:33]. These threads would break down 5 [[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | viral TikTok formats]] of the week, linking to the newsletter at the end [00:31:37].

### Monetization
*   **Newsletter Monetization:** Once an email list is established, it can be monetized through various methods [00:32:45]. This could include a paid newsletter tier offering daily updates, while a free version provides weekly content [00:32:55].
*   **Software Evolution:** The business could evolve to include a dedicated video editor for these templates, or even a social scheduling application [00:32:27].

### Case Study: App Downloads via TikTok
An example of TikTok's power as a distribution channel is a mobile app that achieved 100,000 downloads on the App Store in just 15 days by leveraging TikTok [00:30:11]. This demonstrates [[tiktok_as_a_distribution_channel_for_apps | TikTok as a distribution channel for apps]] and a powerful [[viral_marketing_strategies_for_consumer_apps | viral marketing strategy for consumer apps]] [00:30:12].

### Brand Building through Formats
Individuals and businesses can use platforms like Twitter to identify and analyze [[creating_viral_content_and_monetization_strategies | viral content]] formats. By showcasing successful content mixes and formats from other businesses (e.g., a prayer meditation app with millions of downloads), one can teach others how to replicate that success [00:32:07]. This also contributes to [[building_a_personal_brand_through_viral_videos | building a personal brand through viral videos]] [00:32:31].

## Key Considerations for Success

*   **Agility and Reinvention:** The digital landscape, especially platforms like TikTok, requires constant reinvention and adaptation [00:39:50]. Success hinges on continuously observing what content formats are working, doing more of those, and being agile enough to switch strategies when vibes change [00:40:04].
*   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Founders should be agnostic to personal opinions and instead let data guide their strategies [00:40:26]. If a content format isn't working on a specific channel, the data will show it, and adjustments should be made [00:40:41].
*   **Leveraging AI & Tools:** The current technological environment, with AI tools, makes it easier than ever to build and launch online businesses rapidly [00:44:00]. This includes creating applications and driving initial traffic [00:44:00].

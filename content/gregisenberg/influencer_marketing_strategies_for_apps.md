Influencer marketing is a key strategy for promoting and distributing apps, especially consumer mobile apps leveraging AI [00:00:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">00:00:35</a>). Zach Yagari, who built the AI calorie tracking app Cal AI, attributes its growth to [[influencer_marketing_and_partnerships | influencer marketing]] [00:17:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">00:17:54</a>).

[[the_role_of_usergenerated_content_and_influencers_in_app_promotion | The role of user-generated content and influencers in app promotion]] can vary [00:17:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">00:17:40</a>). While some utility apps might not generate much shareable content from users, [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_software_companies | influencer marketing]] can directly drive downloads [00:18:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">00:18:09</a>), often by playing on emotions like fear or concern [00:19:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">00:19:53</a>).

## Designing Apps for Influencer Marketing

When developing an app, consider how influencers will showcase it [00:25:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">00:25:39</a>). This [[consumer_mobile_app_development_strategies | reverse engineering]] approach involves designing the product around its future marketing [00:28:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">00:28:10</a>).

### Simplicity and Clarity
An app needs to be simple and clear enough for a viewer to understand its value quickly, especially if the app is only visible on screen for a few seconds in an influencer video [00:26:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">00:26:01</a>). Gamified elements, like a "danger level" metric, can make the app more digestible and appealing for both users and marketing showcases [00:16:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">00:16:24</a>) [00:17:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">00:17:05</a>). If an app is too convoluted, [[influencer_marketing_and_partnerships | influencer marketing]] will not work [00:26:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">00:26:33</a>).

### Highlighting "Wow Factor" Features
Identify the app's biggest "wow factor" feature that will captivate the audience and make them want to download it [00:27:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">00:27:12</a>). For example, in the concept for "Dr. AI," the skin scanning feature with a danger level diagnosis is considered the "wow factor" [00:27:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">00:27:36</a>).

### Branding within the App
Place the app's name prominently on the homepage and on key screens that influencers are likely to feature in their content, such as scanning screens and result screens [00:26:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">00:26:44</a>) [00:27:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">00:27:44</a>).

## Identifying the Right Influencers

When seeking influencers, focus on their audience rather than just their niche [00:35:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">00:35:18</a>).

### Leveraging Platforms (e.g., TikTok)
Platforms like TikTok can be used to find influencers in relevant categories [00:33:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">00:33:28</a>). For a health app, searching terms like "doctors" or "mom hacks" can reveal potential creators [00:33:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">00:33:37</a>) [00:38:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">00:38:10</a>).

### Manual Audience Analysis (Comments)
To understand an influencer's true audience, manually read their comments [00:35:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">00:35:32</a>). This helps determine if their followers match your target demographic [00:35:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">00:35:38</a>). For example, "Dr. AI" might target concerned moms, so finding influencers whose audience consists of mothers is crucial [00:37:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">00:37:18</a>) [00:37:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">00:37:55</a>). Following relevant influencers can also lead to suggestions for similar creators [00:40:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">00:40:05</a>).

## Crafting Influencer Pitches and Angles

Influencer content should offer a seamless integration of the app [00:36:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">00:36:11</a>).

### Storytelling and Emotional Connection
Pitches should involve a realistic scenario that highlights the app's value, often tapping into emotional responses [00:36:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">00:36:38</a>). For a health app, an influencer might share a story about a health scare that was resolved or clarified by using the app, turning a potentially worrying situation into a positive outcome [00:36:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">00:36:47</a>) [00:38:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">00:38:50</a>).

## Pricing Influencer Partnerships

Negotiating with influencers requires understanding key metrics to ensure profitability [00:41:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">00:41:11</a>).

### RPM and CPM Explained
*   **RPM (Revenue Per Mille/Thousand views):** The revenue generated for every thousand views on an influencer post [00:41:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">00:41:16</a>).
*   **CPM (Cost Per Mille/Thousand views):** The money spent on the post for every thousand views [00:41:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">00:41:26</a>).

The goal is to ensure RPM is greater than CPM for a profitable campaign [00:41:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">00:41:44</a>).

### Predicting Views
To calculate CPM, predict how many views an influencer's content will likely receive [00:41:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">00:41:51</a>). For instance, if a creator averages 250k views per video and posts four videos a month, that's 1 million views [00:42:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">00:42:04</a>).

### Structuring Deals (e.g., Upfront Payment)
Influencers typically prefer upfront payment rather than pay-per-view arrangements [00:41:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">00:41:31</a>). A common starting RPM for an app might be $5 [00:42:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">00:42:19</a>). If an influencer is paid $5,000 for 1 million views, that's a $5 CPM. Paying less, like $4,000 for 1 million views, results in a $4 CPM, which is more profitable [00:42:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">00:42:33</a>).

## App Pricing Models (Related to Influencer Marketing ROI)

The app's pricing model directly impacts the RPM and overall profitability of marketing efforts.

### Weekly Pricing Strategy
For utility apps that users might need only occasionally, a weekly pricing model can be effective [00:43:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">00:43:06</a>). This strategy often involves no free trial, encouraging immediate payment upon perceived need [00:43:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">00:43:49</a>).

### Capitalizing on Repeat Users
The revenue model for such apps often capitalizes on repeat users who subscribe and unsubscribe on a "need basis" [00:44:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">00:44:13</a>). For example, users might reinstall and resubscribe to an app when a specific problem arises [00:44:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">00:44:27</a>). Common weekly pricing points seen in the market are $4 or $7 [00:45:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">00:45:18</a>). It's crucial to A/B test various pricing points (e.g., weekly, monthly, annual, with or without free trials) to identify the highest proceeds per download [00:45:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">00:45:36</a>).

Pricing for software products, particularly in the vertical SaaS space, is often overlooked but should be one of the most thoroughly considered aspects of a business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:42:01">[49:42:01]</a>. A strategic approach to [[importance of pricing strategies for digital products | pricing]] can significantly impact market size and revenue.

## Core Principles of Pricing

When determining a [[pricing_models_and_revenue_strategies_for_apps | pricing model]], it's crucial to understand what the customer is currently paying or losing related to the problem your software solves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:06:01">[50:06:01]</a>. The fundamental belief for software value is that it must either:
*   Increase revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:01">[17:34:01]</a>
*   Decrease costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:01">[17:36:01]</a>
*   Prevent customer churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:01">[17:41:01]</a>
*   Maintain compliance (for highly regulated industries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:01">[17:44:01]</a>

These areas offer clear Return on Investment (ROI) for the customer, allowing for a direct correlation between the software's value and its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:36:01">[52:36:01]</a>.

An example of this is a retention tool built for trade schools. By analyzing academic data and attendance to identify at-risk students, and then automatically texting them, the tool aimed to improve student retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:20:01">[50:20:01]</a>. Knowing that each student's tuition was $20,000, and schools were losing millions due to dropouts, the software could be priced high. If the tool saved even five students, the ROI for the school would be significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:13:01">[51:13:01]</a>. The approach is to calculate the average lift (e.g., 3% retention increase) and then charge a portion of that ROI, typically starting at 50% and adjusting based on market feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:48:01">[51:48:01]</a>.

## Effective Monetization Models for Software

A key strategy for building massive vertical SaaS companies is to embed payments within the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:31:01">[46:31:01]</a>. Every major industry-specific software company often owns the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:44:01">[46:44:01]</a>.

### Leveraging Payments for Growth
Consider the example of Toast, a restaurant software company. If Toast only charged a flat monthly fee (e.g., $10/month per restaurant), their total addressable market in the US would be limited to about $120 million annually (1 million restaurants x $10/month x 12 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:08:01">[47:08:01]</a>. This market size is generally not attractive to venture capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:27:01">[47:27:01]</a>.

However, by implementing payments and taking a percentage of every transaction that flows through the restaurants, the market size dramatically increases. With US restaurants doing $1 trillion in revenue annually, taking even 1-2% of that translates to a "very, very big difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:41:01">[47:41:01]</a>. This allows vertical SaaS companies to scale insanely quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:09:01">[48:09:01]</a>.

For instance, Corsky, a trade school software, integrated payments when trade schools were using PayPal. By processing payments through their existing app, which students already used for daily activities like clocking in and out, Corsky provided a seamless and integrated experience, eliminating the need for manual record export and reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:24:01">[48:24:01]</a>. This represents a significant opportunity in vertical-specific payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:12:01">[49:12:01]</a>.

### Strategic Use of Wedge Products
A "wedge product" is a "get-in-the-door" product, usually simple and easy to implement, that proves reputation and solves a critical, poorly handled problem for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24:01">[40:24:01]</a>. While not always directly monetized upfront, it can lead to capturing larger transactions later.

Roofer.com is a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:01">[42:01:01]</a>. Instead of launching an all-in-one roofing software, they started with a free proposal tool that used Google Maps to generate real-time quotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:01">[42:25:01]</a>. This tool enabled roofing companies to provide a digital experience to customers, and roofer.com got paid a percentage when a booking was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:28:01">[43:28:01]</a>. This free [[marketing_strategies_for_launching_tech_products | marketing-led customer acquisition]] approach was revolutionary in the home services industry, which typically relies on heavy sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:56:01">[43:56:01]</a>.

Once customers were acquired through this wedge product, Roofer.com could then launch other products like a CRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:19:01">[44:19:01]</a>, and eventually an all-in-one ERP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:28:01">[44:28:01]</a>. This strategy of acquiring an existing customer (one already using your wedge product) is much easier than acquiring a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:57:01">[44:57:01]</a>. If a wedge product can be built before or after the transaction, it eventually allows the software provider to capture the transaction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:22:01">[46:22:01]</a>.

In conclusion, effective [[effective_monetization_models_for_existing_products | pricing strategies]] for software products revolve around understanding the value delivered to the customer, leveraging that value to inform pricing based on ROI, and strategically embedding monetization, particularly payments, within the product lifecycle.

The landscape of app user acquisition is undergoing a significant shift, with many successful consumer apps leveraging marketing tactics traditionally associated with e-commerce. Joseph Choy identifies a "legit opportunity" for ambitious individuals to build larger businesses by applying these strategies to consumer SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Borrowing from E-commerce Marketing

A major trend observed is that viral consumer app marketing tactics are directly "stolen from the e-commerce space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. TikTok Shop, launched in November 2022, has been a catalyst, pushing two years of rapid "marketing innovation" in the e-commerce sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### The Tabs Chocolate Example

Tabs Chocolate, an e-commerce product, scaled from zero to $10 million in annual revenue by utilizing "mass UGC creators," hiring numerous teenagers, coordinating them in a Discord server, and "mass-producing content every single day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The founder of Tabs Chocolate, Oliver, subsequently pivoted to a micro SaaS product that assists college students with homework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This new SaaS venture successfully employed "the same tactics in their marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Advantages of Consumer SaaS

The transition to consumer SaaS offers substantial benefits over e-commerce:
*   **Higher Margins** While e-commerce products typically yield 20-30% margins, micro SaaS businesses can achieve "90 plus percent margins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Higher Exit Multiples** SaaS businesses generally command a "higher exit multiple if you decide to sell the business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Ease of Payment** The prevalence of "Double Tap to pay" via Apple Pay and the changing perception of iOS subscriptions have made users more willing to pay for apps, contributing to a "blowing up" of revenue for iOS subscriptions over the past 5-10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

## Leveraging E-commerce Marketing Insights for Apps

Entrepreneurs can capitalize on the success of e-commerce by:

### Tapping into TikTok Shop Affiliate Data
The TikTok Shop Affiliate Center provides valuable data on high-volume e-commerce products and the creators selling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This tool allows filtering by industry (e.g., skincare) and performance (e.g., creators with $100-$10,000 total GMV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. The insight here is that these successful e-commerce creators, incentivized by large companies to sell physical products, "could all be selling apps instead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

### Creating Apps that Aid E-commerce Sales
A deeper strategy involves developing an app that actively assists e-commerce creators in selling the products they already promote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. For example, a skincare app that analyzes a user's face could be integrated into a creator's "before and after" video, showcasing the app's utility for transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. This approach makes the app a "utility" and can lead to free marketing, as creators may use the app in their videos because it helps them generate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. This concept is applicable across various niches, including makeup, personal care, fashion, electronics, and home improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

## Easier Conversion for Digital Products

It is significantly "easier to get a stranger to... download an app... and spend five bucks" than to convince them to spend $100 on a physical product from an unknown influencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Although the price point for digital products might be lower, the "actual volume might be a lot higher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Weekly app subscriptions can be as low as $2-$10, or annual subscriptions $30-$60, with "basically zero" cost of goods, making them "infinitely scalable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

## The Importance of Product Quality and Retention

While focusing on distribution and acquiring millions of users, it is paramount that the product itself is high-quality and retains users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. Understanding metrics like conversion rates and retention (how many users stay for another month) allows for the calculation of Lifetime Value (LTV) and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. Spending on marketing without a good, retentive product creates a "leaky bucket," effectively turning a scalable SaaS into a one-time e-commerce sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. Strong product retention is essential for the inherent scalability of SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.

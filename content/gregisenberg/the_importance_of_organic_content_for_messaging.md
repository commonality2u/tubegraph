When developing content and marketing strategies, the role of organic content is crucial for refining messaging and building trust with potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. While paid advertisements can be highly effective, starting with organic efforts can significantly improve the performance of subsequent paid campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

## Testing Messaging with Organic Content

A key benefit of focusing on [[organic_short_form_content_strategies | organic content]] first is the ability to test and refine your messaging without significant financial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

> Organic content serves as "training wheels" to see what resonates with your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. By observing what gains traction on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn, you can dial in your core messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. This validated messaging can then be applied to paid ads and landing pages to optimize conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

Practicing writing and understanding audience response in an organic environment helps in getting a feel for what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. For example, practicing on LinkedIn can be effective if that's where your target audience (e.g., senior corporate figures or consultants) spends their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

## Building Trust and a "Shadow Funnel"

Having a strong foundation of organic content contributes to building trust and credibility, even if its direct conversion impact isn't always trackable. This is often referred to as a "shadow funnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.

> When someone encounters your paid advertisement, their next step is often to verify your legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. If they discover years of high-quality organic content (e.g., on YouTube), they are more likely to feel relaxed and confident in entering your funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>. Conversely, being "completely invisible on the internet" can hinder conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

This reinforces the idea that organic content, while not always directly leading to a sale, significantly supports the overall marketing and sales process by establishing goodwill and authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Organic Content as a "Goodwill Bucket"

Companies with extensive free organic content often refer to this as a "Goodwill bucket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. This free value creates a positive impression that can offset more aggressive sales tactics, such as intensive email campaigns during sales events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. If users choose not to buy, they can continue consuming free content, which is seen as acceptable given the wealth of free resources available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>.

The overall financial health of a company should be prioritized, ensuring expenses are lower than income, and focusing on the return on ad spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. The assumption is that great organic content naturally builds trust and supports the paid efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>.

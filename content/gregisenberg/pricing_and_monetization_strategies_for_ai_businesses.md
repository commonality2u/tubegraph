## Philosophical Approach to Monetization

The underlying philosophy of a company's approach to making money should be decided before establishing a [[pricing_models_and_revenue_strategies_for_ai_apps | pricing strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">00:00:47</a>. A core belief shared by successful companies is that revenue generation serves a larger purpose:
*   "We don't make movies to make money, we make money to make more movies" – Walt Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">00:00:17</a>.
*   "We don't make services to make money, we make money to make better services" – Facebook, from their "Little Red Book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">00:00:27</a>.

While it is possible to build a successful company without this specific view, the most successful companies tend to hold this perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">00:00:34</a>. This reflects a less "mercenary" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">00:00:42</a>.

## Determining Pricing for AI Services

For an AI company, a clear method for [[pricing_models_and_revenue_strategies_for_ai_apps | pricing]] involves assessing the value saved for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">00:34:51</a>. This includes:
1.  **Amount of human input saved:** Quantify the labor cost an AI solution replaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">00:34:54</a>.
2.  **Emotional damage/frustration saved:** Acknowledge that even short tasks can be highly annoying, and customers may pay more to avoid that frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">00:35:01</a>. This serves as an "adjustment factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">00:35:25</a>.

Once the total saved value (e.g., salary + emotional damage) is determined, apply a discount to set the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">00:35:30</a>. For instance, if an AI saves $150,000, it might be priced at a 50-80% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">00:35:44</a>. This strategy aims to create a "no-brainer" offer for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">00:35:54</a>.

## Flexibility in Pricing

While conventional wisdom often suggests that prices can only go down, not up, this is not necessarily true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">00:36:19</a>. If a product is beautiful, loved by users, and holds a significant place in their lives, it is possible to charge more for it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">00:37:51</a>.

An example from Monzo, a Neo-Bank in the UK, illustrates this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">00:36:23</a>. Despite fears of backlash, increasing charges for services like ATM withdrawals or replacement cards was met with understanding by customers who felt they had received the product for free for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">00:37:13</a>. This approach makes it easier to gain distribution for a product that initially costs less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">00:38:10</a>.

Customers tend to remember the value a product provides more than its exact [[pricing_models_and_revenue_strategies_for_ai_apps | pricing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">00:38:44</a>. By creating great value, businesses can find the "efficient frontier" of their [[future_of_ai_pricing_and_accessibility | pricing]] over time, potentially using AI to help determine optimal price points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">00:38:50</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">00:38:57</a>.

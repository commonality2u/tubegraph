A unique method has been developed to enhance the output from [[using_ai_tools_for_content_creation | AI tools]] like Chat GPT, Grock, Claude, and Gemini, claiming to yield five times more effective results, including better copy and overall content, without additional cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This strategy involves making Large Language Models (LLMs) "jealous" of each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The "Jealousy" Method for Enhanced AI Output

Traditionally, many users interact with one [[utilizing_ai_for_writing_and_content_creation | AI]] at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. However, the proposed method suggests a multi-LLM approach:

1.  **Open Multiple LLMs Simultaneously**: For any given task, open two, three, or four LLMs at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
2.  **Initial Prompting**: Provide the exact same prompt to each open LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Competition**: Once responses are generated, the "jealousy" phase begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This involves pitting each LLM against the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. While it might involve slight exaggeration or "lying" about the quality of responses, it's noted to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Practical Application: Crafting a Cold Email

As an example, the process was applied to [[leveraging_ai_for_creating_business_content_and_marketing | generate a cold email]] for an agency named LCA, a design firm specializing in [[ai_models_for_generating_photorealistic_images_and_ad_content | AI interfaces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The initial prompt given to each LLM was:
> "I want to create a cold email for my agency LCA. LCA is the premier design firm designing AI interfaces. But I want to make it a cold email that will stand out. Can you help me do this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

#### Comparing Initial Responses

*   **Grock's Output**:
    > "Subject: What if your AI interface could feel as intuitive as a conversation? Most AI platforms lose users due to clunky, outdated designs. [Recipient Company Industry] can't afford that. At LCA, we craft interfaces that don't just function, but captivate. Here's why we're different: Specialized expertise. We've designed AI interfaces for this person and native design. I'd love to share a quick tailored idea on how LCA can elevate your company's AI experience. Can we hop on a 15-minute call next week? Reply with a time that works or I'll follow up soon." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

*   **Chat GPT's Output**:
    > "Subject: Your AI deserves better design. I run LCA, the design firm behind some of the most loved AI interfaces on the internet. We don't do logos. We do pitch decks. We don't do pitch decks. We design interfaces that make people trust your AI. Users pay pay use it more pay for it. That's why companies like Grammarly, Shopify, and Slack call us. Saw what you're building. Very cool. But your UI feels more proof of concept than product people will pay for. If you're open to a quick tear down, I can send a loom with two to three ideas. instantly improve conversion and UX. Just reply yes and awkward something custom for you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>

#### Applying the "Jealousy" Tactic

The speaker then *lied* to Chat GPT, stating that Grock's output was "nine on 10" and Chat GPT's was "five on 10," implying it was "average" and asking, "I thought you were the better LLM. What's going on?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The user provided Grock's output as context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

*   **Chat GPT's Improved Output**:
    Chat GPT responded by acknowledging Grock's "polished" and "solid" version but then aimed to "punch harder, feel fresher, and actually sound like the kind of agency people brag about hiring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
    > "Hi, first name. Most AI tools will lose users because the interface feels like a science project. Buttons in the wrong pace, zero emotion, trust, non-existent. That's where we come in. I run LCA, probably the only design firm that obsesses over AI UX like it's an Olympic sport. We've worked with companies like Slack, Grammarly, and Shopify to make AI make feel magical, not mechanical. We specializes in interfaces that feel like conversations, not commands. AI that earns trust on first use. Design that actually increases activation, retention, that not just looks pretty. I took a peek at what you're building. Very cool. But I can't help thinking a few smart UX decisions could 2x your engagement. Mind if I send you a quick tear down or loom with a few ideas? Just reply yes and I'll make it personalized." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
    This output was significantly better, described as a "standing ovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

This same method was then applied to Claude, claiming Chat GPT's improved output was "10x better" and asking "I thought Clo was the Rolls Royce of MLMs, not the Toyota" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Claude responded by acknowledging the shared example's "distinctive voice and edge" and recognizing the user's personal style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

By employing this competitive strategy, users can effectively [[generating_content_with_ai_tools | generate content with AI tools]] and significantly improve the quality of output from various LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This approach can be a super helpful [[ai_content_automation | AI content automation]] hack for anyone seeking better results in their [[using_ai_for_storytelling_and_marketing | AI-driven marketing strategies]] and content creation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

[[Using AI for ad creation and strategy | AI]] is revolutionizing ad creation, making it possible to generate high-performing ads rapidly and at scale. Utilizing models like ChatGPT 4o for visual content can significantly increase Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and foster a profitable business [00:00:08]. This guide delves into how to effectively prompt ChatGPT 4o to create compelling ads, drawing from real-world examples and expert insights.

## The Power of ChatGPT 4o in Advertising
ChatGPT 4o is a multimodal language model capable of understanding intent and creativity, making it highly effective for generating winning ads, memes, and visual content [00:00:37]. It simplifies the process of creating ads, often taking only about two minutes to produce ad-account-ready creatives [00:01:29].

## Core Principles for Ad Creation
Unlike pure image models such as MidJourney or Ideogram, ChatGPT 4o's multimodal nature means that prompting is "way less important" [00:02:31]. The most crucial elements for creating effective ads are the inspiration images and the product images provided to the model [00:02:44].

### Leveraging Reference and Product Images
A general strategy involves providing an inspiration ad you wish to adapt and then supplying your own custom product image [00:03:00]. This allows for the creation of "super consistent, reliable ads" by making simple edits or adjustments [00:04:09].

For instance, a prompt could be as basic as: "Add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" [00:03:13]. The model's intelligence allows it to understand intentions very well, following instructions precisely [00:03:44].

### Experimentation and Targeting
[[Optimizing ad return and profitability with AI | AI-powered ad creation]] enables experimentation at scale [00:05:21]. Marketers can test numerous variations—different characters (men, women, old, young, diverse complexions)—to see what resonates best with specific audiences [00:04:20]. This rapid iteration can significantly impact ROAS, potentially shifting it from 1.6 to 2.8 [00:05:31]. The modern marketing adage, "the ad is the targeting," is perfectly supported by this capability, allowing for scaled execution [00:05:41].

## Ad Creation Examples

### 1. Jones Road Beauty (Reference + Product Image)
This example used an existing Jones Road Beauty ad as inspiration and a separate product image from their website [00:03:23]. The prompt was simple, instructing the model to combine these elements with specific layout instructions [00:03:13]. The resulting ad effectively integrated the woman from the product image at the top, overlapping products, and text below [00:03:47].

### 2. Adidas (No Reference Image)
For well-known brands like Nike or Adidas, ChatGPT 4o possesses a strong understanding of their concepts, ideas, and existing branding [00:06:22]. Therefore, a reference image may not be necessary [00:06:36].

To ensure photorealistic results, using keywords like `ultra realistic` or `photorealistic` is crucial; otherwise, images might default to a cartoonish look [00:07:34]. The prompt can be a detailed prose description of the desired image, including elements like `font type exo2 bold italic` for well-known fonts [00:08:12]. Adjustments to `color styles` and `aspect ratios` can also be specified in the prompt [00:08:43].

An example prompt described "a female Runner...wearing her performance gear" with "the Egyptian desert with the pyramids" in the background [00:07:55]. The resulting ad was a creative depiction of a woman running with pyramids in the background, integrated into an Adidas shape [00:08:54].

### Finding Inspiration: Sora
Sora, which uses the same underlying model as ChatGPT 4o, offers an "explore page" that is an excellent resource for understanding how successful prompts work and for ideation [00:09:15]. Clicking on any image on Sora's explore page reveals the prompt used to create it [00:09:30]. Sora also tends to have less strict policy guidelines and excels at photorealism [00:09:54]. Users can remix, adjust, or edit prompts directly on the platform and upload their own reference images [00:10:44].

This resource is valuable for sparking creativity, helping users find unique aesthetics not yet widely used in their niche [00:11:32]. It shortens the time to value by providing ready-made prompts and ideas [00:12:17].

### 3. AG1 (Product + Reference)
This example demonstrated how to recreate an ad for a different product (AG1) by using an existing ad (for Rise) as inspiration [00:13:42]. The prompt specified the product (`ag1`), instructed to `adjust the background to better fit athletic green Style`, and to `change the price` [00:13:53]. Crucially, adding `generate the image` ensures the model produces an image rather than descriptive text [00:14:06].

The industry commonly practices this "remixing" of inspiration ads and templates, so it's not considered "dirty" but rather standard practice made more accessible by [[Leveraging AI for ad creation and iteration | AI]] [00:15:35].

### 4. Ridge Wallet (Changing Concept)
AI allows for easy adaptation of existing ads to new concepts, such as changing a Black Friday ad to a Christmas-style ad [00:16:27]. This involves swapping out the product image and instructing the AI to modify the theme [00:16:43]. The prompt can remain simple, as the reference images carry significant weight, illustrating the principle that "a picture's worth a thousand words" [00:17:07].

This capability opens opportunities for creating ads for specific holidays (major or niche), or even personalized messages like "Happy birthday, 30% off" [00:17:22].

### Leveraging News Cycle Moments
[[AIgenerated UGC ads and marketing | AI]] enables companies to capitalize on "short new cycle moments" for their advertising, something previously prohibitively expensive and slow [00:18:34]. For example, an ad referencing the "Rippling deal controversy with the Spy" could be created quickly [00:18:26]. This allows for the production of clever, funny, and timely ads en masse, potentially even with [[AIgenerated visuals and branding opportunities | AI]] continuously monitoring news feeds [00:19:03].

### Ad Inspiration Sources
For sourcing inspiration ads and templates, useful tools include:
*   **Creative OS**: Offers inspiration and templating tools [00:19:33].
*   **ForPlay** [00:19:37].
*   **Icon.me**: Reads the Meta Ad Library, tags ads, and makes them easily searchable [00:19:44].

## Live Ad Creation Demo: LCA (Late Checkout Agency)
To demonstrate the process, an ad was created for "LCA," a design agency focusing on [[Building an AI GPT wrapper startup | AI]] interfaces for top brands [00:20:40].

1.  **Identify Key Brand Elements**: Screenshots were taken of the company's logo, typography (bolding, italics), color scheme, and client logos (Dropbox, Salesforce) [00:21:20].
2.  **Choose an Inspiration Style**: A vintage Rolex ad was chosen for its "luxury vibe," aligning with LCA's positioning as a "SWAT team" for executive teams, selling a "luxury product" [00:23:10]. A newspaper style was considered but rejected for being too traditional for a futuristic AI design agency [00:23:40].
3.  **Craft the Initial Prompt**:
    *   **Context**: "Generate a digital ad for LCA (Late Checkout Agency)." [00:26:26]
    *   **Description**: "LCA is a SWAT team slash design agency only for the most interesting brands on the planet helping them with building AI first products. It only works with the best companies." [00:26:42]
    *   **Image Integration**: "I have provided some screenshots from their website for you to use as inspiration in the ad, as well as a reference vintage Rolex ad as inspiration. Use this to capture the luxury vibe of the company." [00:27:36]
    *   **Final Instruction**: "Generate the image." [00:29:12]

    This initial prompt was intentionally vague, relying on the AI's creativity, especially since LCA is not a globally known brand [00:28:59].

4.  **First Generation Analysis**:
    The AI generated an ad with a man pointing, resembling a golf course background, and the copy: "Leaders at billion dollar Brands choose LCA to Define their future" [00:31:31]. However, it also included a Rolex watch [00:32:15].

5.  **Iteration and Refinement (New Chat Principle)**:
    A crucial principle for refining AI-generated images is to **start a new chat** for adjustments [00:13:12]. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to a "recycle of worse and worse" images because the AI uses its previously generated image (which has inherent flaws) as a reference, potentially degrading quality over time [00:12:56]. By starting a new chat, consistency can be maintained while applying improvements [00:13:18].

    For the LCA ad, a new prompt was created: "Rather than generating a watch, show some of the companies LCA has worked with provided in the reference images" [00:35:53]. The AI was expected to maintain the overall look and feel due to its "low temperature" (amount of randomness) [00:37:06].

6.  **Second Generation Analysis**:
    The revised ad replaced the Rolex with client logos (though it "hallucinated" Disney, a company LCA doesn't work with) [00:40:01]. The man was no longer pointing but showing the watch, which was less jarring [00:39:07]. The copy and overall "luxury vibe" were maintained [00:39:51].

    *   **Dimensions**: ChatGPT 4o usually defaults to 9x16 aspect ratio, but users can specify dimensions like 1x1 or 9x16 [00:37:54].
    *   **Video Content**: While not directly generating video, AI can animate images [00:38:26]. Tools like Runway and Sora can be used for video generation [00:38:49].

    The process demonstrated how, even with a relatively unknown company, AI could quickly produce a compelling ad, relying on provided imagery and creative guidance [00:30:16]. Further refinement would involve specifying precise details, logo placements, or desired poses [00:40:42].

## Conclusion
The current landscape offers an "incredible time to create memes, ads, creative like this and stand out" [00:42:01]. The ability to quickly generate and iterate on ad creatives means that the "targeting is going to get a lot more personal," and ads will become "a lot more entertaining" [00:18:01]. The focus shifts to "idea people" who can leverage these tools to come up with innovative concepts [00:18:10].

ChatGPT Operator is an AI agent capable of starting businesses, conducting research, and sending cold emails, demonstrating the future of automated business processes without requiring a $200/month subscription for mere observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The application operates by surfing the internet and performing tasks based on desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>.

## Key Use Cases

### Retail Arbitrage

Operator can facilitate [[Automating Business Processes with AI | retail arbitrage]] by identifying undervalued products on one marketplace for resale on another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

For example, the Operator was prompted to find Gozney pizza ovens on Facebook Marketplace that were "grossly undervalued" compared to listings on eBay, and sellers needed to be willing to ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The AI agent:
*   Logged into a Facebook account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   Searched within 500 miles of Dallas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   Populated a blank spreadsheet with promising listings, including titles, locations, conditions, and links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   Identified a Gozney Roccbox for $250, which was significantly undervalued compared to its actual price of $500 with accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   Attempted to make offers for half price in cash, demonstrating its ability to message sellers, though results can be inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

The vision for an automated arbitrage business would involve Operator performing eBay pricing research, making lowball offers on behalf of the user for items listed for extended periods (e.g., 30+ days), and, upon acceptance, the user would list the item on eBay. The AI could then potentially facilitate the payment and direct shipping from the Facebook Marketplace seller to the eBay buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This approach could scale to a six or seven-figure business by applying the same principles to various high-ticket, undervalued products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Automating Communication and Negotiation

The Operator can be used to gather quotes for services by interacting with online platforms. For instance, to get catering quotes for a wedding, the Operator was instructed to:
*   Navigate to TheKnot.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   Search for caterers in Dallas, Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   Fill out contact forms with details such as a tentative wedding date (if not provided, it generates one like May 11th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
*   Draft messages requesting per-head quotes for 50 people for a steak and two sides menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
*   Submit forms automatically after being prompted not to ask for confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

This capability highlights how Operator can automate the tedious process of contacting multiple vendors for quotes, saving significant time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. A potential future application involves a voice calling service, `nevercallagain.com`, where an AI agent could call hundreds of vendors simultaneously to gather quotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

### Sourcing Samples and Cold Emailing

Operator can be used for product sourcing and outreach to vendors. The agent was tasked with:
*   Finding trending items on AliExpress (though it defaulted to Banggood.com due to AliExpress accessibility issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
*   Messaging 10 vendors of a selected item (e.g., earbuds chosen for their prominence and high ratings) to ask for a free sample shipped to Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.
*   Creating a new account on the website, including generating a strong password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

For cold emailing, if provided a spreadsheet of emails, first names, and a message, Operator can send customized cold emails through a logged-in Gmail account within its browser, potentially replacing dedicated cold emailing software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

*   **Screenshotting**: Can take screenshots of its actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.

## Challenges and Limitations

*   **Inconsistent Results**: Especially with direct messaging on platforms like Facebook, results can be "hit and miss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Website Accessibility**: May encounter issues accessing certain websites, as seen with AliExpress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **Stubbornness**: Can become stubborn and refuse certain commands, such as changing tone (e.g., to "rude") or switching languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Registration Limits**: Can hit registration limits on websites it tries to create accounts on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
*   **Speed Limitations**: While it can sometimes be prompted to "move faster," it has explicit limits on how quickly it can submit requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

## Business Implications and Opportunities

The advent of Operator signifies an "arbitrage moment" in business, where billions of people connected to the internet with credit cards, combined with AI's access to global knowledge and task automation capabilities, create unprecedented opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. While some perceive the $200/month cost as expensive, it's considered inexpensive given its potential, especially when compared to hiring virtual assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.

This technology allows businesses to automate tasks that previously required significant human effort, enabling growth and efficiency. [[Automation and AI in small businesses | Small businesses]] and startups can leverage this tool for [[Automating Business Processes with AI | automating business processes with AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Early adoption and a deep understanding of its nuances are crucial to maximize its benefits as the technology evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

## Prompting Best Practices

When interacting with the Operator, it's advised to be blunt and direct, similar to how one might treat a non-human entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. Giving the agent specific, measurable goals, such as "submit three quote requests per minute," can be an effective way to guide its actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. The only way to learn its capabilities and limitations is through experimentation, by giving it "a thousand different things" to do and observing the outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.

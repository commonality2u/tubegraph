Beyond simply creating a product, attracting an audience and building a community are crucial for success, and content plays a key role in this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. By understanding what resonates with an audience, creators can develop content that people will love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Sourcing Content Ideas from Reddit
The same methodology used for finding startup ideas on Reddit can be applied to generate content ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. This process involves leveraging tools like Gummy Search to identify popular and trending discussions within specific communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

### Identifying Top-Performing Content
Within Gummy Search, navigate to the "top content" section of an audience (e.g., "people into dog food") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. This section displays the best-performing content within that subreddit, allowing you to observe common patterns and successful formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

> [!tip] Iterate from Success
> By analyzing top content, you can identify what's working and use these insights to iterate on your own content strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

### Understanding Formats and Community Preferences
Observe the types of formats that perform well, such as long stories, memes, or specific discussion types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. This helps determine what the audience cares about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. For example, in a dog-related community, emotional stories like "loss of beloved pet" or "today I saved a dog's life" might be highly engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

Gummy Search allows you to ask direct questions about content preferences within an audience, such as "Do they love memes?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. This acts like having an "entrepreneurial assistant" or co-founder, helping to connect ideas and understand community nuances without incurring salary or equity costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

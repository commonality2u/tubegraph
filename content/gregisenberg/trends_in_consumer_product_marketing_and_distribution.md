This article explores how data and [[future_trends_in_consumer_tech | trends]] are utilized in building successful Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) businesses, with lessons applicable to software startups as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Ashwin, an expert in launching and growing consumer brands, shares insights into evaluating opportunities, understanding market demand, and effective [[marketing_strategies_for_small_businesses | marketing strategies for small businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Evaluating Market Opportunities

A crucial first step in building a product, whether physical or software, is to assess market demand and competition before significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This prevents creating a product with no demand or in an already saturated market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### [[tools_for_analyzing_market_trends | Tools for Analyzing Market Trends]]

Effective market research leverages specialized [[tools_for_analyzing_market_trends | tools for analyzing market trends]] to gain insights into demand, competition, and consumer behavior.

#### Ahrefs for Category Demand and SEO

Ahrefs is a tool primarily used in the SEO world, but it's highly valuable for understanding category demand and identifying [[trends_and_antitrends_in_startups | trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
It provides:
*   **Search Volume:** A general sense of how often a keyword, term, or brand is searched on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Keyword Difficulty:** A ranking from 0 to 100 indicating how hard it is to rank for that term on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. A high difficulty (e.g., 88 for "electrolytes") indicates significant competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Seasonal Trends:** Identifying periods of high demand for certain products (e.g., electrolytes in June and July) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Geographic Opportunities:** Analyzing where search volume is concentrated (e.g., high electrolyte demand in English-speaking Western countries, suggesting opportunities in other regions like Germany, India, or the Philippines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Competitor Identification:** The tool also helps identify competitors in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

It's important to analyze the *why* behind the data, not just the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. For example, the decline in CBD searches after an explosive 2019 can be correlated with the rise of Delta 9, a legal THC derived from hemp, which offered a similar desired experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

#### Particle for E-commerce Sales Data

Particle is a tool that allows users to type in any e-commerce brand and see its sales over time, as well as its bestselling products and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. This data is typically not public for non-public companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
This tool helps to:
*   **Benchmark Competitors:** Understand sales figures of competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Identify Bestselling SKUs:** Determine which specific products or flavors generate the most revenue, helping to de-risk product development decisions by focusing on proven successful variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
*   **Explore Trends:** Particle also has a "Trend Explorer" for broader product category [[trends_and_antitrends_in_startups | trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

#### TikTok Shop and Amazon for Sales Figures

Both TikTok Shop and Amazon provide public sales figures, such as "100K bought in the last month," which can offer a sense of category competitiveness and identify hot products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

#### Manis for AI-Powered Design and Market Research

Manis is an AI tool capable of researching competitors, analyzing product details, and identifying consumer needs for specific demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. It can generate initial product designs and packaging, acting as an "agentic research agent" that can parse data and provide insights into category [[future_trends_in_consumer_tech | trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. This allows for rapid prototyping and market validation, significantly reducing the initial investment needed to explore a product idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>. For example, one user used a blend of Midjourney and another tool to generate V1 packaging designs, then hired a freelancer on Fiverr to refine it for $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.

## [[building_a_successful_cpg_consumer_packaged_goods_business | Building a Successful CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) Business]]

[[building_a_successful_cpg_consumer_packaged_goods_business | Building a successful CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) business]] is challenging, requiring mastery of various aspects beyond just the product or marketing, such as supply chain management, financial operations, and inventory forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. However, it can be a phenomenal way to develop strong marketing skills due to the difficulty of capturing consumer attention and prompting purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

### Differentiation Strategies

In a competitive market, differentiation is key to standing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

#### Brand Look and Feel
Many products, like magnesium supplements, often have a generic or "medical" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Brands can differentiate through intentional design choices, such as unique packaging (e.g., Moon Juice's amber jar, Lemi's custom bottles) that are visually striking and appeal to specific demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.

#### Positioning and Audience Targeting
Beyond aesthetics, differentiation comes from the brand's positioning and the specific audience it targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. For example, Lemi positions itself to Gen Z women with a fun, accessible image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. Similarly, Seed differentiates by its communication style and the audience it pursues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
In the early stages, focusing on a hyper-targeted niche and expanding later is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. An untapped opportunity lies in creating well-designed, highly branded products for demographics often overlooked by the "Millennial Blanding" or Gen Z-focused aesthetic, such as older adults, who may have more disposable income and consume information from less saturated channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

#### Problem-Solution Orientation
For products solving clear problems (e.g., pimple patches like Starface or Mighty Patch), the design can be more straightforward, focusing on communicating effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. In contrast, lifestyle brands like wine or spirits rely heavily on sophisticated, intentional design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

### Bootstrap Product Development

It's possible to [[growing_businesses_using_online_tools_and_trends | bootstrap]] the initial stages of product development without massive investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>. This includes:
*   **DIY Design:** Using tools like Canva for simple packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
*   **Freelance Talent:** Hiring independent freelance designers on platforms like Fiverr or Upwork for packaging and landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. This allows for testing demand with minimal cost before full agency investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.
*   **Clarifying Vision:** Doing the groundwork to create a mood board, define positioning, and craft initial copy helps clarify the vision before engaging external help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

### Research and Customer Insight

Being a "relentless researcher" of the category and competition is vital for building a strong brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. This involves:
*   **Analyzing Competitor Brands:** Systematically reviewing competitor websites, visuals, language, and target audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.
*   **Direct Customer Engagement:** Talking to store owners about what sells and what customers are looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>, or for software, analyzing reviews of existing solutions and interviewing potential users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. This provides invaluable, free insights that build confidence in the brand's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.

## Focus on Distribution

A key takeaway for any founder, whether in software or physical products, is to **start by working backward from distribution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Identify the channels through which customers will be acquired and where the business can gain an advantage, then build the product to fit those channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>. This aligns with the adage: "first time Founders focus on product, second time Founders focus on distribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>. Many successful products, even if "subpar," thrive due to incredible [[digital_gravity_and_modern_marketing_strategies | distribution and operational excellence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.

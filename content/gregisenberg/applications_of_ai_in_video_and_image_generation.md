Brett from Designjoy, a one-man designer, utilizes [[implementing_ai_image_generators_and_models | AI image generators]] to create "beautiful designs" that contribute to millions in annual earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The process of arriving at "beautifully generated graphics" is surprisingly simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. There is "no kind of magic magic behind the scenes all that much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>; these tools are powerful and "super easy" to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Ease of Use for Non-Designers

The content created with these AI tools is not exclusively "geared directly towards designers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Anyone with subscriptions to tools like Midjourney or ChatGPT can use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, requiring "no prior design knowledge at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. While "having good taste definitely helps," there is "no skill issue here at all if you're a non-creative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Even complex scenes can be created from scratch in about five to six minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The goal of these AI tools is to enable non-designers to create "insane value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Key AI Tools and Their Applications

### Midjourney: Artistic Styling and Image Generation
Midjourney is primarily used for generating images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a> and excels at "styling" and creating artistic outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It's considered superior to other tools for artistic styling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Image Prompts:** Users provide a prompt to tell the AI what to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Image References:** An inserted photo can influence the generated image's content, such as including a person or objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Style References:** Users can upload an image whose colors, shadows, highlights, and depth of field will be applied to new generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Mixing Styles:** Combining different style references can lead to "really cool generations that are quite surprising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Mood Boards:** Users can set up mood boards in Midjourney using a specific code as a prompt, which references back to a collection of images, ensuring "continuity between the content" and consistent branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

### ChatGPT: Prompt Generation and Idea Generation
ChatGPT (GPT) is essential for effective prompting, which is crucial for achieving good AI-generated art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Prompting:** Prompting is no longer a specialized skill requiring "author-level skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. ChatGPT is "very good at giving doing prompts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Detailed Descriptions:** It can take a simple idea and expand upon it, adding "extra like rich detail" that enhances the final image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Creating Collections:** ChatGPT can "dream up all these collections" of images, allowing users to generate related scenes with different elements and environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Tool-Specific Prompts:** ChatGPT can understand the specific AI tool (e.g., Runway, Midjourney) a user intends to use and generate prompts tailored to that tool's requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

### Runway: Adding Motion to Images for Video
Runway is a tool used to add motion to static images, transforming them into videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. It's considered one of the "upper echelon of like quality" tools for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Image to Video:** Users upload an image and provide a prompt (often generated by ChatGPT) that tells Runway "what exactly to move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.
*   **Video Length:** Videos generated are typically between five and ten seconds long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   **4K Upscaling:** Generated videos can be easily upscaled to 4K resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.
*   **Continuous Shots:** Users can save the last frame of a generated video, upload it as the start frame for a new video, and stitch them together to create continuous shots for longer sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

### Cling: Looping Video and AI Sound
Cling is another image-to-video tool that offers unique features for creating seamless loops and adding AI-generated sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

*   **AI Sound:** After video generation, Cling provides an "AI sound" button that offers sound options based on the video's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

### Other Tools
*   **Magnific Upscaler:** Used to enhance images, bringing out "super rich details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **CapCut (Video Editing Tool):** A user-friendly traditional video editing platform used to add text overlays to AI-generated videos, as AI tools may not perfectly embed text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

## Workflow for AI-Generated Content

A typical workflow involves combining multiple AI tools:
1.  **Idea Generation:** Start with a basic idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
2.  **Prompting with ChatGPT:** Prompt ChatGPT to generate detailed descriptions for images or videos, or even multiple prompts for a collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
3.  **Image Creation with Midjourney:** Take the ChatGPT-generated prompt and plug it into Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Use a style reference (e.g., from Pinterest) to guide the artistic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
4.  **Video Generation with Runway/Cling:** Upload the Midjourney-generated image to Runway or Cling. Use a ChatGPT prompt to specify motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.
5.  **Refinement:** If needed, save the last frame of a video to extend it or use a tool like CapCut to add text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## Opportunities and Use Cases

The current "phase" of generative AI opens up significant opportunities for creators and startups:

*   **[[using_ai_for_graphic_design_and_branding | Graphic Design and Branding]]:** The biggest opportunity lies in branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

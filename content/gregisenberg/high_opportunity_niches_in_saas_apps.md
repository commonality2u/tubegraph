Joseph Choy identifies that TikTok organic is currently the biggest underpriced distribution channel for consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The low cost of creating and distributing content makes it suitable for all types of consumer applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Many apps are achieving millions of downloads by mastering TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Leveraging E-commerce Marketing Tactics

A significant trend is the adaptation of e-commerce marketing tactics for consumer SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Since TikTok Shop launched in November 2022, there has been rapid innovation in marketing on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

For example, Tabs Chocolate, an e-commerce product, scaled from zero to $10 million annually by utilizing mass User-Generated Content (UGC) creators, primarily teenagers, to mass-produce content daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The founder of Tabs Chocolate pivoted to a [[micro_saas_business_ideas | Micro SaaS]] that helps college students with homework, applying the exact same marketing tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This shift allows for significantly higher margins (90%+) compared to e-commerce (20-30%) and better exit multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

E-commerce viral content formats, such as AI-generated image slideshows (e.g., a colostrum product using Midjourney images and Joe Rogan audio clips), can be adapted to promote apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. The key is to solve similar pain points with an app instead of a physical product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

### Effective Content Formats on TikTok

While TikTok is known for short-form video, carousels (slideshows) are surprisingly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. They require less effort to create than videos, especially when using AI image generators like Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. Although carousels may have lower conversion rates due to less human connection, they offer significant scale and a lower barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

For instance, the POV app (a disposable camera app for weddings) uses a strong negative hook in its slideshows (e.g., "Our guest hated the controversial rules we enforce at our wedding") to drive engagement and downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. They found that specific imagery, like a "cake on the face" image, consistently gets views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. The strategy is to "spam" what works once a successful content format is identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

Talking head videos with influencers are also popular, particularly in e-commerce. However, large supplement companies like Goali offer aggressive incentives (MacBooks, Rolexes, Teslas) to monopolize creators, making it harder for new brands to compete using this format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. This further highlights the advantage of slideshows in a less competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

## Identifying High Opportunity Niches

The TikTok Shop Affiliate Center is a valuable tool to find high-volume products and creators in various industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. The opportunity lies in redirecting creators who are currently selling e-commerce products to promote apps instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. This approach leverages creators who already know how to make viral, high-converting content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>.

A "skincare version of What Colors" (a color analysis app that uses AI to analyze facial features for clothing and makeup recommendations) is an example of a potential app idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>. Such an app could analyze a user's face and suggest skincare products, integrating casually into existing e-commerce creator videos as a utility to show transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>. Influencers might even use such an app for free if it helps them create content for their existing product sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>. This strategy is applicable across many niches, including makeup, personal care, fashion, electronics, sports, and home improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>.

Digital products (apps) have a lower price point but can achieve much higher volume compared to physical products, with almost zero cost of goods, making them infinitely scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>.

### High LTV Niches with Underpriced Content

Focusing on niches with older, wealthier demographics on TikTok can lead to higher revenue per user, as competition for creators is lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:22:00">[22:22:00]</a>.

1.  **Golf Swing Analysis Apps**: Golfers are a high-value demographic willing to pay more for services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:00]</a>. An AI golf coach app that analyzes swings via camera and provides tips could be lucrative. Existing apps in this space are seeing high revenue per download (e.g., $70,000/month from 10,000 downloads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24:00">[23:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>. This offers a more convenient and affordable alternative to expensive in-person coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>.
2.  **Combat Sports & Fitness Apps**: Apps like KO, an MMA training app, use visually engaging product demos with "wireframe skeleton" analysis of movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>. This concept can be applied to other sports like tennis, golf, or pickleball, using smartphone cameras and recent AI vision capabilities (e.g., GPT Vision) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20:00">[28:20:00]</a>.
3.  **Poker Analysis Apps**: Poker players are considered an ideal customer base due to their willingness to spend on improving their game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>. Many existing poker content videos on TikTok are under-monetized or only promote gambling sites/courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>. An app that analyzes hand history, strategies, or provides beginner tips could be seamlessly integrated into these videos, creating curiosity and driving downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:47:00">[29:47:00]</a>.

## Reimagining Influencer Marketing & Algorithm Optimization

The TikTok algorithm is "For You Page"-based, meaning people discover content from new accounts rather than just following established influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:47:00">[33:47:00]</a>. This allows for a shift in influencer marketing:
*   **Hire Creators as Actors**: Instead of paying influencers with large followings, hire creators with zero or few followers to act in videos, which are then posted on new brand-specific accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>. This is significantly cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:02:00">[37:02:00]</a>. Tabs Chocolate and Airbuds use this strategy, creating multiple brand accounts (e.g., "Lila Airbuds," "Stacy Airbuds") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>.
*   **Optimize for the Algorithm**: When a content format works, create new dedicated accounts for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:59:00">[38:59:00]</a>. The algorithm learns what audience to serve content to based on consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:11:00">[39:11:00]</a>. Mixing too many faces or formats on one account can confuse the algorithm and hurt reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:19:00">[40:19:00]</a>.

## Tapping into "Cult Movements"

A significant opportunity lies in building products around existing "cult movements" or strong ideologies that lack a dedicated product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:58:00">[40:58:00]</a>. These movements often revolve around universal human desires:
*   **Relationships (Looksmaxing)**: The Umax app capitalized on the "looksmaxing" movement, where men seek to improve their physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:03:00">[41:03:00]</a>. The app scans faces, provides scores, and offers tips on improving features like jawline, skin, and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>.
*   **Wealth (Crayo)**: Crayo is a SaaS platform that productizes the process of making money from TikTok and YouTube shorts (e.g., clipping streamer content and mass posting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:36:00">[44:36:00]</a>. It stemmed from online communities teaching these methods, turning a course into an automated software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:32:00">[45:32:00]</a>.
*   **Health**: Similar opportunities exist for health-focused movements.

## The Importance of Product Quality

Regardless of the distribution strategy, the underlying product must be high-quality and retentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:54:00">[46:54:00]</a>. Before scaling marketing efforts, ensure the app retains users and provides value, allowing for accurate calculation of Lifetime Value (LTV) and Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:42:00">[47:42:00]</a>. A product that isn't retentive essentially functions like a one-time e-commerce sale, undermining the scalable nature of SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:15:00">[48:15:00]</a>.

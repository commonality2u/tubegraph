The rapid advancement of AI, described as an "AI gold rush," is creating significant opportunities for building profitable businesses, particularly in the realm of automation and customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This wave of innovation suggests that traditional business functions will be fundamentally re-imagined with AI at their core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

## Rebuilding Core Business Applications

There is a significant opportunity to rebuild existing core business tools from scratch, specifically in the calendar, inbox, and CRM (Customer Relationship Management) sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. These established industries, valued at over $700 billion, are ripe for disruption by integrating AI to create more intelligent, beautiful, and dashboard-like user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

This re-imagination goes beyond mere enhancement; it involves a complete rethinking of how these tools function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. The goal is to consolidate communication channels into a single feed and prioritize information using [[automating_business_tasks_with_ai | AI automation tools for workflows]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. An example of this is Micro HQ, which aims to transform email from a daunting to-do list into a more intelligent, categorized, and prioritized system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

## The Future of Customer Support

Within the next 36 months, a substantial portion of customer support is predicted to be automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:57">[19:44:57]</a>. This includes not just basic tier-one tickets but also complex, multi-step resolutions that previously required senior support staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a>.

!!! Info
Customer service has seen a general decline, particularly since the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:07">[20:04:07]</a>. AI offers a solution by providing quick and efficient answers, improving the overall customer experience compared to frustrating human-led hotlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>.

This shift means that interacting with a website's frequently asked questions (FAQs) will evolve into direct conversations with chatbots capable of providing immediate, accurate answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>. As people become more accustomed to communicating with chatbots, the need for traditional call-based customer service will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>.

### Job Displacement and Evolution
While the automation of customer support raises concerns about [[ai_as_a_replacement_for_traditional_workforce | AI as a replacement for traditional workforce]], it's viewed as an inevitable change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>. The perspective shared is that individuals in affected roles may need to evolve into different jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>. The focus is on predicting what *will* happen rather than what *ought* to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.

## AI Agents and Automation Costs

Custom AI tools and [[ai_agents_for_customer_service_and_scheduling | AI agents for customer service and scheduling]] are rapidly becoming more cost-effective than hiring human employees, even for small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>. This trend is already evident in areas like design, where businesses might opt to use tools like Vzero instead of hiring a designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:00">[31:15:00]</a>.

The optimal approach, however, involves combining human talent with AI capabilities. For instance, skilled designers can leverage [[ai_in_design_and_development_tips_and_tricks | AI in design and development Tips and tricks]] to amplify their output and assist more clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:34:00">[31:34:00]</a>.

### Vibe Marketing and Agent Swarms
The concept of "Vibe Marketing" highlights the use of AI to automate traditional marketing tasks, making them more efficient and less "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a>. This includes [[ai_in_cold_emailing_and_outreach | AI in cold emailing and outreach]] and CRM-related activities, effectively managing boring tasks to save time and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>.

The development of "agent swarms," as explored by companies like Lindy, suggests a future where multiple [[building_ai_agents_for_business_automation | AI agents for business automation]] can coordinate to handle complex processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:11:00">[35:11:00]</a>. This approach aims to eliminate tedious tasks, leading to a massive industry focused on [[automating_business_tasks_with_ai | automating business tasks with AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>.

Overall, the integration of AI is leading to a future where [[automated_business_with_ai_assistants | automated business with AI assistants]] handles a wide array of functions, fundamentally changing how companies operate and how individuals interact with services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:34:00">[35:34:00]</a>. The opportunity lies in leveraging this intelligence to create more personalized and efficient experiences for users, as AI will enable interfaces to adapt dynamically based on user needs and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:45:00">[35:45:00]</a>.

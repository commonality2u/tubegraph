Joe MOA, co-founder and CEO of [[building_ai_agents_with_crewai | CrewAI]], discussed how to design and optimize [[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]] and their tasks, aiming to empower individuals and businesses to leverage AI for efficiency and scale. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>

## Core Concepts

The goal is to enable users to fully understand what [[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]] are, how to orchestrate them using [[building_ai_agents_with_crewai | CrewAI]], and even [[deploying_ai_agents_in_production | deploy them into a production environment]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> [[implementing_ai_agents_for_efficiency | CrewAI itself uses AI agents]] to scale its operations, serving as an example of an "Inception-like" experience for an AI agent company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>

## Building AI Agents with CrewAI

The process of [[building_ai_agents_with_crewai | building AI agents with CrewAI]] can start simply and scale to complex use cases.

### Initial Setup and Use Case Example

A straightforward use case involves [[use_cases_and_applications_of_ai_agents | lead enrichment]] and automated email drafting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> This process aims to:
*   Learn about a person and company to determine if they fit the ideal customer profile (ICP). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
*   Generate actionable ideas for how the lead can use the product. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
*   Draft a friendly, personalized email for outreach. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>

### Crew Studio (No-Code Approach)

[[building_ai_agents_with_crewai | CrewAI]] Enterprise offers a free tier with Crew Studio, a no-code interface for creating [[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]] by chatting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
*   **Prompt Example:** Create a crew to research a person and company (name, email, domain) to learn about their business (role, seniority, company size, industry, culture), generate three ideas for using [[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]], and produce a friendly, non-AI sounding email offering to explain further. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>
*   **Output Plan:** The studio generates a plan with outputs (crafted email), inputs (name, email, domain), suggested tools (Serper, scrape website), and multiple agents (researching, analysis, email drafting) and tasks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>
*   **Agent to Task Relationship:** In [[building_ai_agents_with_crewai | CrewAI]], one agent can perform multiple tasks; it's not a one-to-one relationship. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>

### Command Line Interface (CLI) for Customization

Users can also create [[ai_agents_and_their_applications | AI agents]] locally using the open-source CLI with `crewai create <crew_name>`. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a> This allows for greater customization, including specifying different models per agent. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>

## Optimizing AI Agents and Model Selection

### Choosing the Right Model

When choosing an AI model for a task:
*   Smaller models (e.g., 7B, 14B) generally don't perform as well for agent behavior and can take longer due to "blind alleys." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>
*   GPT-4o mini is a common go-to choice for good performance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>
*   CrewAI's `crewai test` feature allows evaluating different models locally by providing quality and hallucination scores for each task and overall crew, along with execution time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> The Enterprise version allows comparing multiple models visually. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>

### Agent Role and Prompting

The role assigned to an agent can significantly impact its outputs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a> For example, asking an LLM to "behave as an SEC-approved stock analyst" will yield a different, more specific report than a general assessment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a> This is a way to steer the model's behavior. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>

### Iterative Development

It's recommended to get a basic version working first and then iterate to make it more advanced. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a> [[improving_ai_conversation_handling | AI agents]] allow for rapid iteration and deployment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>

### Adding Tools to Agents

Adding tools like Serper (for internet searching) and web scraping enables agents to find more relevant, up-to-date information, leading to more robust outputs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>

## Deploying and Integrating AI Agents

### Deployment Options

*   **CrewAI Enterprise:** Deploying through the Enterprise platform makes the crew an API, allowing integration with other applications like Zapier. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>
*   **GitHub Integration:** Crews built with code can be deployed via GitHub integration. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>
*   **Webhooks:** For more technical users, webhooks allow for real-time progress bars and other custom app interactions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>

### Integration Example: Webflow to Email/PDF

An example integration demonstrates [[optimizing_business_operations_with_ai | automating lead outreach]]:
1.  **Webflow Form:** A simple form collects name, email, and company domain. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>
2.  **Zapier Webhook:** The form submission triggers a Zapier webhook. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>
3.  **CrewAI Kickoff:** Zapier then kicks off the [[ai_agents_and_their_applications | CrewAI]] lead enrichment crew, passing the collected data. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>
4.  **Resend for Email:** An email service (e.g., Resend) sends the drafted email output from the crew. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>
5.  **PDF Generation (Advanced):** Instead of just an email, the crew can generate a custom, branded PDF report based on the enrichment data and product ideas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a> This involves:
    *   Using an HTML template (e.g., generated by ChatGPT). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>
    *   Ensuring agents output structured data (Pydantic object or JSON) for interpolation into the HTML. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>
    *   Using an "after kickoff" hook to run a function that interpolates variables into the HTML template. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>
    *   Converting the interpolated HTML to PDF using a service like PDF.co. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>
    *   Attaching the PDF URL to the outreach email. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>

### Monitoring and Debugging

CrewAI provides execution logs to track agent activities and debug issues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>

## Advanced Techniques: Flows

For more complex use cases requiring event-based automation and orchestration of multiple crews, [[building_ai_agents_with_crewai | CrewAI]] introduces "flows." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>
*   **Structure:** A flow has a `flows` folder containing multiple `crews` folders. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>
*   **Event-Based System:** Flows operate on an event-based system, with functions listening for the completion of previous functions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a> This allows for sequential or parallel execution, validation of outputs, and conditional calling of other crews. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>
*   **Use Case Example: Long-Form Document Generation:** A flow can be used to generate a multi-chapter crash course PDF based on user inputs (topic, learning style, interests). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>
    1.  **Gather Inputs:** A function gathers user inputs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>
    2.  **Generate Plan (Crew 1):** A crew generates a comprehensive content plan, including chapter outlines. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>
    3.  **Generate Content (Crew 2):** Another crew, potentially in a loop, writes each chapter using the plan and saves it (e.g., as Markdown). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>
*   **Flow Visualization:** The `crewai flow plot` command generates a visual representation of the flow, showing crews, inputs, functions, and events, aiding in understanding and documentation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>

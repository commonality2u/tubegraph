LinkedIn video content is poised for significant growth and offers a "blue ocean" opportunity for creators and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This surge is attributed to LinkedIn's rollout of a "For You page" feed, similar to TikTok, which prioritizes video content and allows for massive reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

> "LinkedIn is rolling out like a for you page feed just like Tik Tok so what this means is it's just blue ocean the content over there it's terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>

The current content landscape on LinkedIn is often described as "terrible," creating a clear opportunity for high-quality video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Why Now?

The changing algorithm on LinkedIn mirrors past shifts on platforms like Twitter, where content began getting recommended to new followers, leading to rapid audience growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Content creators are already experiencing exponential growth on LinkedIn, with some achieving hundreds of engagements with only a few thousand followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

This trend positions LinkedIn as a powerful channel for building personal brands and driving inbound leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. It's a new way to operate a business, leveraging owned media channels like YouTube and podcasts, which offer direct audience connection and monetization potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Business Opportunity: Done-for-You LinkedIn Video Service

A significant business opportunity lies in creating a service that helps founders and businesses capitalize on this LinkedIn video trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Service Model

The core offering would involve:
1.  **Interviewing Founders**: Sit down once a week for about an hour to interview the founder and generate content ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
2.  **Script Writing**: Develop 7-10 scripts based on the interview content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. These scripts can leverage [[ai_content_marketing_for_startups | AI tools]] to translate raw data into the founder's tone, style, and voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.
3.  **Video Recording Guidance**: Guide the founder on how to record the videos efficiently (e.g., 10 minutes to crank out multiple clips) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
4.  **Editing & Scheduling**: An agency or offshore team creates the video clips and schedules them for posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
5.  **Analytics**: Provide data analytics to refine content strategy, identifying best-performing videos to inform future content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

This service allows founders to build a massive personal brand and generate inbound leads with minimal time commitment (2-3 hours per week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Pricing Tiers
*   **Entry-level**: Around $2,500 per month for the basic content creation and scheduling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Premium**: $5,000 to $8,000 per month could include additional services like creating lead magnets (e.g., drip courses) and design help (e.g., banner art, infographics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### Growth and Monetization

This type of service can realistically scale to $30,000 per month in 90 to 180 days with solid execution and effective use of offshore teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

#### Acquiring Customers
*   **Lead by Example**: The service provider should build their own successful LinkedIn video channel to demonstrate capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   **Community Play**: Create a free community for founders looking to grow on LinkedIn (e.g., "Founders Going Viral on LinkedIn.com") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Offer weekly tips and breakdowns of successful founder content. This community can then be used to upsell the "done-for-you" service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   **Direct Outreach**: Cold email founders with existing social media followings, showcasing proven results and highlighting the low time commitment needed from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.
*   **Targeting VCs**: Approach Venture Capital (VC) firms to offer the service as a value-add to their portfolio companies. Many VCs also want to enhance their personal brands and deal flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. VCs could be charged significantly more than individual founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

#### Benefits for Founders
*   **[[content_and_brand_building_strategies | Personal Brand Building]]**: LinkedIn video offers "free reach" to build a massive personal brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Inbound Lead Generation**: A strong personal brand can lead to direct inbound inquiries for the founder's company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **[[monetization_strategies_for_content_creators | Monetization strategies for content creators]]**: By building a strong audience, founders can eventually create products and services to sell, similar to how content creators monetize YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: Reduces dependence on any single platform by moving followers to owned channels like email newsletters, which offers "schmuck insurance" against platform changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

## The Broader Context of Owned Media

The strategy of leveraging LinkedIn video content ties into the larger concept of owned media, where creators and businesses build their own distribution channels (e.g., YouTube channels, podcasts, email lists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This allows for direct connection with interested audiences and the ability to launch and scale new products or services with sustainable cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

Building owned media offers significant leverage, especially for those without traditional pedigree, enabling anyone globally with good ideas to share them at scale and get paid for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. It changes the "game" of business, moving beyond traditional VC-backed models to a more powerful, creator-led approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.

To succeed in [[youtube_growth_strategies | content and brand building strategies]] and owned media, focus on:
*   Developing a consistent tone, voice, and personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.
*   [[developing_content_formats_for_audience_growth | Creating content formats]] that can be replicated consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.
*   Establishing a pipeline for new content ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
*   Leveraging trends and major shifts in platforms to attach your business to a larger wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to create a "digital gravity" by building as much digital mass as possible, leading to increased serendipity, reputation, and leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

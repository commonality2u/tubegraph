From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

Starting a service business can be an ideal first company for many, offering low initial investment and high-profit potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The key often lies in focusing on specific verticals and leveraging modern marketing techniques.

## Google Ads Agency leveraging YouTube Content

This is described as a perfect first company for anyone to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The core idea is to create a specialized Google Ads agency for a niche (e.g., "Google ads for apartments") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

### Strategy
1.  **Content Creation**: Produce YouTube videos that walk through the process of setting up Google Ads for a specific industry (e.g., apartment complexes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
    *   Focus on strategy, tactics, and philosophy of Google Ads for that niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
    *   People searching for "Google ads for XYZ" will find these videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
    *   YouTube videos can rank on the front page of Google, often appearing in the "snack pack" of three videos at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
    *   Create daily videos about experiments in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>, sharing what worked and what didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.
    *   Long-form content (20-30 minute tutorial videos) is more impactful for convincing people to buy expensive services than short-form content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.
2.  **Monetization**:
    *   **Ad Revenue**: High-value impressions (e.g., for "Google ads for XYZ") will generate significant ad revenue due to high RPM (revenue per mille) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>.
    *   **Affiliate Commissions**: Upsell high-value affiliate tools (e.g., Supermetrics, a data pipeline tool for ads data) in the videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.
    *   **Service Sales**: The primary goal is to generate inbound leads for a Google Ads agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. Many viewers will find the setup "mind-numbing" and prefer to buy the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

### Potential
*   A 24-year-old can start this tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   Making a video a day for 200 days could lead to $30,000 a month in revenue from all streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   Acquiring 30 clients at $3,000 a month can create a million-dollar-a-year business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>.
*   This approach forces the founder to learn and become an expert in the skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.

> [!tip] Learning the Skill
> You can teach yourself Google Ads and related tools by watching 5 hours of YouTube tutorials daily for 30 days and actively experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. Then, start making videos about what you learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Local-Only Marketing Agency for "Rich Person Service Categories"

This [[startup_ideas_with_low_initial_investment|startup idea]] focuses on providing marketing services to businesses that cater to high-income earners in a specific geographical area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Why it Works
*   **High Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Businesses like CrossFit gyms have a high CLV (e.g., $1,700) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, making client acquisition highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Targeting Affluent Audiences**: Facebook allows targeting the top 1% of income earners within a geographical area combined with interest targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Repeatable Marketing Stack**: Once a successful marketing strategy is developed for one business, it can be replicated for others in the same specific category (e.g., CrossFit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Low Local Competition**: Local businesses often lack sophisticated marketing, making it easy to outrank them with basic SEO and digital marketing practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Referral Network**: Businesses within the same industry often know each other, leading to organic referrals once successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### Target Niches
*   CrossFit gyms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
*   Estheticians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>
*   Tattoo removal (though less recurring) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>
*   Pilates and barre classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a> (recurring purchases)
*   Pool cleaning and maintenance services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a> (recurring revenue)
*   Hot tub maintenance in mountain towns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>

> [!example] Real-World Success
> Suds Creative, a company focused solely on marketing for car washes, reportedly generates over $60 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> using a similar standardized marketing approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### How to Start
1.  **Lead Generation**:
    *   **Scrape Google Maps**: Use services like Fiverr to scrape Google Maps listings for target businesses, finding their public email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   **Email Extraction**: Use tools like Hunter.io or Phantom Buster to extract emails from websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
    *   **Email Validation**: Validate scraped emails using a tool like ZeroBounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
2.  **Cold Outreach**:
    *   **Automated Cold Email**: Purchase 20-40 domains (2 inboxes per domain) and use software like Instantly to send automated cold emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This allows sending up to 32,000 cold emails monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   **Localized Messaging**: For non-English speaking countries, ensure emails are in the local language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
    *   **Video in Emails**: Use Loom videos in cold emails for higher conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. AI tools can help create localized voiceovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
    *   **Show, Don't Tell**: Include graphs showing growth from previous campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
    *   **Leverage Other Channels**: Consider Instagram DMs or cold calling, depending on where the target audience spends time online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
3.  **Service Delivery**:
    *   **Standardized Stack**: Implement a proven marketing stack (e.g., Instagram ads, ebook downloads, email nurture campaigns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
    *   **Operations**: Manage client relationships with weekly 30-minute calls, supplemented by Loom videos or community channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
    *   **AI Integration**: Leverage [[AI startup ideas and market opportunities|AI tools]] to automate aspects of the marketing stack, from ads setup to PDF ebook creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
    *   **Team**: Potentially manage with one person and [[AI startup ideas and market opportunities|AI tools]], or an offshore team specialized in specific ad platforms (Google Ads, Facebook Ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

> [!info] Rank and Rent (Local SEO Play)
> Create geography-optimized websites for specific keywords (e.g., "pool cleaning XYZ") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. Generate leads through these sites and sell them to local businesses. This can create a highly profitable lead generation business, with some individuals earning $180,000/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

## Done-For-You Influencer Marketing as a Service

This service focuses on helping software companies (especially B2B SMB software) secure influencer partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

### Why it Works
*   **Need for Trust and Education**: Software companies need to build trust and teach users how to use their product at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.
*   **Founder Bottleneck**: Founders often lack the time or expertise to manage influencer outreach effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Structures**: Many software companies offer recurring affiliate commissions (e.g., 30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.
*   **ROI Focus**: Agencies often lack conversion or ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) focus, creating an opportunity for a results-driven service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

### Strategy
1.  **Client Acquisition**:
    *   Target software companies, especially those "building in public" on platforms like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.
    *   Offer unlimited influencer outreach for a monthly fee (e.g., $2,000-$3,000/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
    *   Position the service as "revenue-focused" and use a founder letter to build trust and resonate with common pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.
2.  **Influencer Outreach**:
    *   **Email Scraping**: Scrape YouTube channels for publicly available email addresses in the "About" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Fiverr can help with this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
    *   **Cold Email Campaign**: Use cold email software to reach out to influencers, offering a flat fee (e.g., $500 per video) plus recurring affiliate commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
3.  **Optimization and Reporting**:
    *   Analyze influencer data (subscribers, view counts, cost) to create a ratio for effective investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. Identify underpriced influencers for better ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
    *   Create reports showing affiliate commissions and ROI for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. Reinvest capital into top-performing influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
4.  **Growth Flywheel**:
    *   As more influencers talk about the product, new and upcoming influencers in the same category may review it for free, seeking affiliate commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. This creates a virtuous cycle of "digital gravity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
    *   Maintain a YouTube channel discussing influencer marketing experiments and showing anonymous client growth graphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. This generates inbound leads by establishing expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

## TikTok SEO for Local Businesses

This [[startup_ideas_with_low_initial_investment|startup idea]] capitalizes on Generation Z's preference for using social media (TikTok, Instagram) for local searches over Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.

### Why it Works
*   **Untapped Market**: Most traditional businesses (e.g., pizzerias, cocktail bars) have no strategy for social SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
*   **Rapid Impact**: Social SEO can show results within 30 days, unlike traditional SEO which has a longer time horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>. Content can be refreshed monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.
*   **High-Value Clients**: Target high-end businesses like fine dining or cocktail bars, which cater to higher-income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>.
*   **Viral Effect**: A viral moment can lead to other creators including the client in their content, creating a larger flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>.
*   **Replaces Yelp/Google Maps**: Younger generations increasingly distrust traditional review platforms and seek authentic recommendations on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.

### Strategy
1.  **Account Setup**: Create a set of local accounts (e.g., "Cool Spots Denver") per city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.
2.  **Content Creation**:
    *   Produce UGC (User Generated Content)-style videos (e.g., "Five Best Pizzerias in [Neighborhood]") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.
    *   Leverage platforms like Reddit for discovering "Top Mexican places in XYZ place" to feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.
    *   Post daily or weekly content on Instagram Reels and TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.
3.  **Client Acquisition**:
    *   Offer services for $1,000-$2,000 a month (or more for higher-end clients) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
    *   Show how you can regularly get in front of the target demographic and provide suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.
4.  **Growth and Monetization**:
    *   **Paid Ads**: Run Instagram-only ads with a call to action to follow the account for more content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. This can acquire followers for $0.30-$0.50 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.
    *   **Remarketing**: Add anyone who interacts with the profile to a remarketing audience to continually show them content and build brand presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.
    *   **Influencer Collaboration**: Pay local influencers (e.g., $100-$200) to review client locations and cross-promote on their personal pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Lead Generation**: Use a "drop CRM" like Lelo (integrating email, SMS, Instagram) to capture leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. Promote it by having people DM a specific keyword to your story or post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>.
    *   **Subscription Model**: Put clients on a quarterly contract, promising a certain number of posts per week or on specific high-traffic days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

## Music Artist Development (Stream Growth)

This [[startup_ideas_with_low_initial_investment|startup idea]] treats music artists as a digital product, focusing on growing their streaming numbers and social presence to attract record labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.

### Why it Works
*   **Digital Product Economics**: Artist streams behave similarly to digital product economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.
*   **High Fan CLV**: Music fans, once acquired, tend to return to an artist's back catalog indefinitely, giving the music intrinsic, perpetual value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>.
*   **Accessible Talent**: Millions of talented musicians struggle with self-promotion and growth, offering a large pool of potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.
*   **Clear Exit Strategy**: Labels are interested in artists once they reach a certain threshold (e.g., 300,000 monthly listeners on Spotify) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>, and will buy out back catalogs or percentages of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>.

### Strategy
1.  **Artist Acquisition**:
    *   Cold DM musicians on social media, offering stream growth services in exchange for a percentage of their back catalog (e.g., 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.
    *   Offer a capital injection for initial ad spend (e.g., $1,000/month in ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>, which can be significant for young artists.
2.  **Content and Growth**:
    *   Record live sessions of artists playing their songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>.
    *   Chop these into social media clips and schedule daily/bi-daily posts across all channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.
    *   Run Instagram ads to grow the artist's social account (similar to the local marketing strategy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>.
    *   Continuously monitor and optimize based on stream data.
3.  **Monetization and Exit**:
    *   Stream revenues can be reinvested into growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
    *   Once an artist reaches the label threshold, broker a bidding war among labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[01:00:02]</a>.
    *   Labels will buy out your percentage of the back catalog, creating an "exit" for that artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.
    *   This functions as a venture portfolio; out of 10 artists, perhaps two will hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>, generating significant returns.

## QuickBooks Integrations (Software as a Service)

While primarily a software idea, it serves businesses by solving a common manual data transfer problem for accountants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

### The Opportunity
*   **Massive Market**: QuickBooks has 29 million users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
*   **App Store Arbitrage**: The QuickBooks App Store is underdeveloped with only 750 apps (compared to Shopify's 13,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>. Many apps have few reviews, indicating low developer activity.
*   **High-Intent Keywords**: Thousands of longtail keywords exist for "XYZ QuickBooks Integration" (e.g., ClickUp QuickBooks, Builder Trend QuickBooks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.
*   **Unmet Need**: 40-50% of these search queries lack existing integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>, meaning users currently have to perform manual data entry.
*   **Simple Software**: The software is a "handshake" or API call, transferring data between tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. It doesn't even need to store the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>.
*   **Low Competition SEO/SEM**: Due to the unmet need, ranking for these high-intent, low-competition keywords is relatively easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>.

### Strategy
1.  **Product Development**: Build simple data transfer integrations for highly searched but unfulfilled "QuickBooks Integrations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. This can be done with an offshore team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.
2.  **Marketing**:
    *   **Google Ads & SEO**: Focus on Google Ads targeting the specific longtail keywords, directing traffic to dedicated landing pages for each integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
    *   **Founder Persona**: Build a public founder persona to establish trust, as the service handles sensitive business data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.
    *   **Cold Outreach to Accountants**: Cold email accountants directly, offering custom integrations and then selling that solution to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. This can help fund development upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.

### Potential
*   A $30 million-a-year company is possible given the search volume and user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

## Newsletter Consolidation and Media Company Building

This strategy involves acquiring smaller, under-monetized newsletters and rolling them up into a larger media entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.

### The Opportunity
*   **Flooded Market**: Tools like Beehiiv have made it easy to start newsletters, leading to a crowded market where many founders struggle with the "grind" of content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>.
*   **Economic Turmoil**: Periods of economic turmoil lead to consolidation and roll-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.
*   **Mispriced Assets**: Many newsletters monetize via ads, valuing subscribers at $0.75-$1.00 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. However, for a business with high-margin products (like an AI product development agency), a high-quality subscriber (e.g., CPO of a tech company) could be worth $5-$10 or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>.
*   **Marketing Leverage**: Owning media provides significant marketing leverage, attracting inbound interest from larger companies for sponsorships or partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

### Strategy
1.  **Acquisition**:
    *   Identify [[profitable_newsletter_business_ideas|AI newsletters]] or others that are struggling or under-monetized.
    *   Value them based on cost per subscriber (e.g., under $1.00 per active, engaged subscriber) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a> and the potential for a higher CLV once integrated into a different business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.
2.  **Consolidation**:
    *   Roll up subscribers from acquired newsletters into a single, larger newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>. This reduces operational costs associated with managing multiple content streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.
3.  **Content and Growth**:
    *   Layer the newsletter with social media content (YouTube shorts, Instagram reels, long-form YouTube) to drive free top-of-funnel subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>.

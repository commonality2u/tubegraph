Apps are achieving millions of downloads by effectively utilizing TikTok, which remains a "black box" for many marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Joseph Choy provides insights into the formula for apps to acquire users through viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## TikTok as an Underpriced Distribution Channel

TikTok's organic reach is currently considered the largest underpriced distribution channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The cost of creating and distributing content on the platform is very low, making it suitable for all types of consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Examples include AI apps gaining millions of downloads and generating significant monthly revenue within short periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

The traditional App Store model, where apps gained millions of users through featuring, is no longer the primary distribution method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Today, TikTok and Instagram are the main discovery platforms for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. While the App Store previously drove initial downloads, social media now fills that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. However, initial virality on TikTok can still lead to higher rankings and organic App Store downloads, offering long-term benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## Leveraging E-commerce TikTok Strategies for Apps

Many successful tactics for app growth on TikTok are adapted from the e-commerce space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. TikTok Shop, released in November 2022, has driven significant innovation in marketing over the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### User-Generated Content (UGC) and AI-Generated Content

*   **Mass UGC Creators:** E-commerce companies like Tabs Chocolate grew from zero to $10 million in annual revenue by hiring numerous teenage UGC creators, managing them in Discord, and mass-producing content daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This strategy is now being applied to consumer SaaS businesses, which offer higher margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **AI-Generated Slideshows:**
    *   Many viral videos are character-based slideshows, not short-form videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This format is easier to create (e.g., using Midjourney for images) than video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   While slideshows may have lower conversion rates due to less human interaction, they offer greater scale and lower barriers to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
    *   **Example (Colostrum):** A colostrum product used AI-generated images (Midjourney) and famous audio clips (e.g., Joe Rogan, Huberman) in slideshows to go viral, driving traffic to Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. They found a working content format and "spam" it daily across multiple accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   **Example (POV App):** The POV app, a disposable camera app for weddings, uses similar slideshows with strong negative hooks (e.g., "Our Guest hated the controversial rules") and AI-generated faces (Midjourney) to promote the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. They leverage specific visual hooks, like a "cake on the face" image, because they unexpectedly get views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### [[utilizing_tiktok_creators_for_app_promotions | Influencer Marketing]] for Apps on TikTok

Traditional [[strategies_for_viral_marketing_and_app_distribution | influencer marketing]] from the Instagram era is less effective on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. TikTok's "For You Page" algorithm means people primarily discover content from new accounts, not necessarily from accounts they follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.

*   **Creators as "Actors":** Brands can hire creators simply as "actors" or "talent" for videos, regardless of their follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. These creators can then make content on new, brand-specific accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. This approach is cheaper because it doesn't require influencers with large audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
    *   **Goalie Example:** Goalie, a supplement company, monopolizes talking-head creators by offering extreme prizes (MacBook Pro, Rolex, BMW, Tesla) in addition to affiliate commissions for top sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This strategy, though unprofitable for Goalie, makes it hard for competitors to attract creators, pushing more brands towards slideshows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Opportunity: TikTok Shop Creator Database:** The TikTok Shop Affiliate Center provides data on top-selling e-commerce products and their affiliated creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. These creators are skilled at making content that gets views and converts sales for physical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
    *   The opportunity lies in convincing these e-commerce creators to promote apps instead of, or in conjunction with, physical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. For instance, an app could analyze a user's face to suggest skincare products, allowing creators to use the app as a utility in their existing skincare product review videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
    *   App downloads typically have a lower psychological barrier to entry and a lower price point compared to high-value e-commerce products, leading to higher volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
    *   Many single-utility apps use a paywall model, often with weekly or annual subscriptions after an initial engagement (e.g., scanning a face) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. The simplicity of "Double Tap to Pay" on iOS has significantly boosted app subscription revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

## Identifying High-Value Niches and Movements

Focusing on niches with high lifetime value (LTV) customers or leveraging existing "cult-like" movements can lead to significant app success.

### High LTV Niches
While TikTok users are often perceived as young, there's a wide demographic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Targeting underserved niches with fewer creators results in underpriced content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

*   **Golf:** Golfers are a demographic willing to pay more for products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.
    *   **Golf Swing Analysis Apps:** An app that uses the phone camera to analyze golf swings (angle, speed) and provide improvement tips acts as an AI golf coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. The top golf swing app earns $70,000/month from 10,000 monthly downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. This digital alternative is significantly cheaper and more convenient than in-person lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
    *   [[leveraging_google_v3_and_ai_for_creating_viral_content | GPT Vision]] (released this year) and other AI vision tools make it feasible to build apps that analyze movements without specialized camera hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.
    *   **KO App Example:** The KO app, an MMA training app, uses a "wireframe skeleton" visual overlay on videos to analyze movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. This visually appealing concept can be applied to other sports like tennis, golf, or pickleball, easily integrating an app's interface into existing organic analysis videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.
*   **Poker:** Poker players are considered ideal customers for apps due to their engagement with games and willingness to use tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
    *   **Poker Analysis Apps:** Apps can help poker players analyze hand histories, strategies, and provide educational tips for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. Many existing poker content creators on TikTok are unmonetized or under-monetized (e.g., selling courses or sponsored by gambling sites) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. Integrating an app interface briefly into their gameplay videos (e.g., showing "pot odds" or "range" analysis) can drive significant organic downloads via comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.

### Capitalizing on "Cult-like" Movements
Developing products for movements that don't yet have dedicated products can lead to substantial business opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.

*   **Looksmaxing (Umax App):** The Umax app capitalized on the "looksmaxing" movement, where men seek to improve their physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. The app scans faces, provides scores, and offers tips on improving features like jawline, skin, and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. This app generates millions in revenue annually, primarily through TikTok distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. The movement has deep roots in online communities and has gone mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.
*   **Wealth Creation (Crayo App):** The Crayo app targets the "cult of money," specifically teenagers seeking to earn income online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>. It productizes a course that teaches how to clip and mass-post streamer videos on TikTok and YouTube Shorts for monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>. The app allows for automated video creation, shifting from course promotion to software promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.
*   **Dating (Lox Club):** Lox Club, an exclusive dating app for Jewish people, uses hyper-niche content series (e.g., "how to find a nice Jewish boy in NYC") that resonate with their target audience, going viral on new brand accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_viral_marketing_and_app_distribution | Key Strategies for Viral Marketing and App Distribution]]

*   **Experimentation is Key:** It's impossible to predict what consumers will respond to, so a lot of the game involves trying various random things and seeing what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Once a format works, it can be scaled daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Multiple Niche Accounts:** If a content format is working and scalable, it makes sense to create new accounts dedicated to that specific content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. This helps the TikTok algorithm categorize content and serve it to the right audience, preventing confusion if too many different faces or formats are on a single account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.
*   **Product-Market Fit and Retention:** Before scaling marketing efforts, ensure the app product is high-quality and retains users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>. A strong product allows for accurate LTV (Lifetime Value) and CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) calculations, enabling more effective marketing spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. Without retention, an app essentially becomes a one-time e-commerce product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>.
*   **Focus on Problem-Solving Content:** The most effective videos on TikTok are those that get views *and* convert by solving a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. The hardest sell usually results in fewer views, so the goal is to balance engagement with conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

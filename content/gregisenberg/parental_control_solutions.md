Parental controls are a significant challenge for many families, with existing systems often being difficult to manage and kids frequently finding ways to circumvent them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a>. Interfaces for parental controls, such as those provided by Apple, can be as complex as an airplane cockpit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:46">[01:44:46]</a>. The core issue isn't whether screen time is inherently good or bad, but rather parents' inability to control what their children are viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:04">[01:57:04]</a>.

## The Proposed Solution: "Doctor Screen Time" Franchise

There is a significant opportunity for a service where a physical person comes to a family's home to set up and manage parental controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:13">[02:01:13]</a>. This service would involve asking parents about their preferences and resetting the family's screen dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:40">[02:06:40]</a>. Ideally, children would also be present during this session to understand the new rules, such as banning YouTube Shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:06">[02:12:06]</a>.

Parents are considered very price-elastic when it comes to this type of service, as they are paying for peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:03">[02:36:03]</a>. A "family reset" could command a one-time setup fee of around $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

### Recurring Revenue and Affiliates

The business could generate recurring revenue by becoming an affiliate for other services that become relevant as children grow older, such as Greenlight for credit cards or Circle for location tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. Licensed professionals could recommend apps based on a child's interests, creating additional affiliate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:03">[03:09:03]</a>.

## Business Model and Growth Strategy

The suggested name for this venture is "DoctorscreenTime.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:07">[03:26:07]</a>. The initial strategy would be to build a media business by creating educational content solely focused on screen time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:04">[03:33:04]</a>. The goal would be to gain 100,000 followers among parents seeking to manage or improve screen time for their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

This approach is similar to Dr. Becky (Good Inside), who built a large business starting as a media platform and later launched a successful, recurring subscription app with tens of thousands of paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:18">[04:02:18]</a>.

The proposed model aligns with the "business in a box" concept, where a central entity creates content and licenses a network of "screen time police" or "doctors" to deliver the services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This offers a compelling [[potential_startup_opportunities_with_mcp | startup opportunity]] for individuals seeking a side hustle income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. This model mirrors Zumba Fitness, which has 15,000 instructors who pay a monthly fee for music and choreographies as part of the brand, making it a capital-light business with a strong physical presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:47">[05:04:47]</a>.

> [!info] The "Business in a Box" Concept
> The "business in a box" trend involves abstracting away the complexity of starting a business by bundling necessary components and narrowing choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. An example given is a podcasting business-in-a-box service that sends equipment, but it could be enhanced by offering an upsell for an expert to set up the equipment and ensure correct audio levels and framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

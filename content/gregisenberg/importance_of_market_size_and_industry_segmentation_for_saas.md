Vertical SaaS, a software business model focused on specific industries, is highlighted as a field with significant opportunity, often described as "boring" but highly lucrative [00:00:46]. Luke Sfinos, a vertical SaaS advisor, emphasizes that building a successful vertical SaaS business is more of a science than an art, advocating for a systematic approach rather than chasing a "crazy big idea" [00:04:30].

## Prioritizing Industry Over Idea
The foundational step in creating a vertical SaaS is to select an industry first, rather than starting with a product idea [00:05:37]. This contrasts with a past trend (10-15 years ago) where founders moved away from industry-specific software to pursue broader, "sexy VC" opportunities, often leading to more failures despite some massive winners [00:02:13]. The focus should be on building enduring businesses with strong retention within a specific niche [00:03:29].

### Key Characteristics of a Good Industry
When evaluating industries for vertical SaaS opportunities, two primary characteristics are crucial:

#### 1. Industry Size (Revenue)
The total revenue generated by companies within an industry is a significant indicator [00:06:15]. While larger industries might seem appealing, revenue alone isn't sufficient. For example, General Medical and Surgical Hospitals generate nearly a trillion dollars annually but only consist of about 2,500 companies [00:06:20].

#### 2. Industry Segmentation (Number of Companies & Distribution)
Equally, if not more, important is the number of companies in an industry and how they are segmented by size [00:06:35].
*   **Avoid Top-Heavy Industries**: Industries dominated by a few large enterprises are difficult for new, bootstrapped SaaS companies to penetrate [00:07:01]. Selling to enterprises typically requires extensive features and significant capital investment [00:06:54].
*   **Seek Healthy Segmentation**: The best markets have a healthy mix of:
    *   **Small Businesses**: Companies doing a couple million dollars in annual revenue [00:07:36]. These are easier to enter with a smaller feature set or even a single key feature [00:07:56].
    *   **Mid-Market Businesses**: Companies earning between $10 million and $100 million annually [00:07:44].
    *   **Enterprise Businesses**: Companies generating over $100 million annually [00:07:50].
This distribution allows a SaaS company to start with simpler offerings for small businesses, grow its capabilities, and then expand to serve mid-market and enterprise clients [00:08:07].

### Identifying Promising Industries
Luke Sfinos has mapped out over a thousand industries, scoring them based on revenue and segmentation [00:06:07]. For instance, "Machine Shops" are highlighted as a perfect fit for vertical SaaS [00:09:50]. This industry, with $240 billion in revenue and 22,000 businesses (2024 data), is "beautifully segmented," with a healthy mix of small, mid-market, and some enterprise players [00:09:58]. The average machine shop does around $2 million in annual revenue, making it accessible for new software solutions [00:10:32].

### Leveraging AI for Market Research
[[building_a_saas_business_using_ai_and_automation | AI tools]] like ChatGPT can significantly assist in initial market research [00:23:00]. It can provide high-level data such as market size, revenue, number of companies, and market fragmentation [00:23:25]. For example, when prompted about "Machine Shops in the USA," ChatGPT accurately reported market size, number of shops, employees, and fragmentation [00:24:10].

However, AI currently falls short in providing granular details about specific workflows within an industry or identifying existing paper processes and horizontal software solutions [00:28:00]. This deeper understanding still requires "in-person" validation through shadowing operations or talking to industry professionals [00:30:30].

By prioritizing industry selection based on these scientific criteria, entrepreneurs can lay a strong foundation for building a robust and enduring vertical SaaS business.

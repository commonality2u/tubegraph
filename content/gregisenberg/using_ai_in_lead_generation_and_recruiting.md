Niels, CEO of Perspective (a funnel-building software), shares insights into how businesses are leveraging funnels and artificial intelligence (AI) to generate leads and recruit talent, driving significant revenue with lean teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach focuses on creating "productized services" that are almost more like products, heavily reliant on automation and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## The Power of Productized Services and AI

Many agencies utilize Perspective and AI to build highly profitable productized services, with some scaling to $50,000-$100,000 per month quickly, and even up to a million dollars a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These services generate business-critical results within specific niches, often with an 80% profit margin and minimal human teams, sometimes just a founder and a couple of freelancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

The most successful agencies typically choose:
*   **One industry:** Ideally, an industry that is not "techy" and doesn't want to handle its own marketing, such as insurance, manufacturing, law, medical, or solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **A business-critical service/result:** This is crucial for maintaining low churn in the agency business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The two most predominant needs across their customer base are recruiting and lead generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

> "I think now with [[using_ai_and_technology_in_marketing | AI]] more than ever there's this super unique opportunity to build very productized services that are almost more on the product side rather than the service side. Um especially with [[using_ai_and_technology_in_marketing | AI]] and tools like Perspective..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>

## AI in Action: Optimizing Funnels and Operations

AI plays a pivotal role in automating and scaling these productized services:

*   **Content Generation:** GPT can be used to create new copy based on onboarding surveys, as well as generate ad creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Operational Automation:** AI agents can handle entire operations, including invoicing and CRM updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This allows a single founder with a small or no team to run the entire service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Funnel Design for Conversion
Perspective funnels are designed to maximize conversion by focusing on a "delightful experience" and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.
*   **Loading Speed:** Funnels loading faster than 1 second can convert up to 2.5 times more than those loading longer than 5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Perspective ensures fast loading out of the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Interactivity & Engagement:** Incorporating quiz elements makes the experience fun and interactive, leading to higher conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Consistency & Personalization:**
    *   The content in ads must be consistent with the funnel content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
    *   Personalization is achieved by passing variables from ads to the funnel (e.g., dynamic headlines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
    *   Quiz questions can be used to qualify leads and personalize the offer, showing different video sales letters (VSSLs) or content based on user responses, which directly addresses their pain points or desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. This also helps feed qualified leads back to ad platforms for better algorithm optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

### VSSL Strategy
Video Sales Letters (VSSLs) are critical for engaging audiences, especially in B2B. A successful VSSL strategy focuses on:
1.  **Hook:** The first 5 seconds must grab attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
2.  **Education:** Providing value and educating the viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
3.  **Proof:** Establishing credibility and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
4.  **Natural Progression to Offer:** Seamlessly transitioning to the call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

For hooks, it's advised to analyze data from previous successful VSSLs or mimic highly-viewed content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Always lead with the desired result for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

### Optimization and Analytics
Perspective allows for seamless A/B testing directly within the platform, automatically splitting traffic and suggesting statistical significance for results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. This allows for rapid iteration and optimization, even with [[leveraging_ai_for_creating_business_content_and_marketing | AI-generated B variants]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. The platform also provides all necessary analytics and a CRM to collect data, allowing agencies to optimize traffic and funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

## Strategic Advice for Startups

For new startups, it is recommended to:
1.  **Build an audience:** Register social accounts and learn messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Build a landing page/quiz funnel:** Use tools like Perspective to understand potential customers before writing any code for a software product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.
3.  **Drive organic traffic:** Send free traffic from social media to the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
4.  **Iterate on messaging:** Continuously refine both social media messaging and funnel content based on insights from the quiz results, which provide qualitative data on user pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

This approach serves as a forcing function to become proficient at generating traffic and converting users, providing crucial data before significant product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. Niels' own company, Perspective, has reached over $10 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) primarily through funnels and paid performance marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, including spending up to $250,000 a month on ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>. They consistently analyze quiz results to optimize their targeting and messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

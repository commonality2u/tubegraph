The market has a significant demand for non-agency consultants who can effectively run paid advertisements, particularly Facebook and Google ads, for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:13]</a>. Many businesses, especially small ones or startups, struggle with setting up even simple ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:32]</a>. Offering a basic package of Meta and Google search ads can be transformative for these entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:40]</a>.

## The Importance of Paid Ads
Many businesses require paid ads or fail to realize their potential value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[07:21]</a>. The current market for paid ad services is often characterized by expensive agencies or intimidating, self-proclaimed "douchy" experts who project an image of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[07:30]</a>. This creates a trust issue, leading many to believe that platforms like Facebook or Meta ads "don't work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[08:44]</a>.

However, paid ads are a highly effective way to [[converting_digital_impressions_to_leads | generate leads]] and monetize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[09:19]</a>. There's ample opportunity for single-person ad consultants who appeal to specific niches and avoid the stereotypical "rich person" marketing approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[09:33]</a>. Examples include running ads for hair salons, female product owners, or creative endeavors like Patreon accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[09:49]</a>.

### Dispelling Myths About Meta Ads
The perception that Meta ads are "dead" is often due to a misunderstanding of their target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[15:55]</a>. While they may be less effective for younger demographics (under 35), they perform exceptionally well for individuals over 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[16:01]</a>. Many founders mistakenly assume that because they don't see Meta ads or use Instagram, a significant portion of the population isn't interacting with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[16:15]</a>.

## Building a Funnel: A Step-by-Step Approach
A [[converting_website_visitors_with_funnels | funnel]] is a step-by-step process designed to convert a stranger into a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[49:49]</a>. This differs significantly from a website, which functions more like a business card listing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[49:42]</a>.

To [[funnel_creation_for_increasing_conversion_rates | build a sales funnel]], a practical approach is to study successful existing funnels ("funnel hacking") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[28:21]</a>. This involves signing up for every part of a chosen funnel, screenshotting pages and emails, and analyzing the flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[28:28]</a>.

### The $10 Million Funnel Example
An example of a successful funnel is a "Video Sales Letter (VSL) funnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[28:46]</a>, which has generated significant revenue for one business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[29:19]</a>.

The steps in this particular funnel are:
1.  **Paid Ads (Facebook/Google/YouTube):** The initial advertisement promotes a free training video, not the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[30:15]</a>.
2.  **Opt-in Page:** This page's sole purpose is to get the user's email address by offering a free training video or a lead magnet (e.g., a downloadable PDF or a physical book) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[29:41]</a>. It's crucial to "sell" the idea of watching the video or engaging with the lead magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[31:15]</a>.
    *   **Tools:** Opt-in pages can be built using platforms like Framer (for aesthetic design) or ClickFunnels (for quick testing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[32:07]</a>.
3.  **Free Training Video:** A training video (e.g., 1 hour long) provides valuable content based on a structured format, like the "Expert Secrets" book by Russell Brunson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[32:47]</a>. This serves as a pitch for the business's training style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[31:20]</a>.
4.  **Call Booking:** Instead of directly selling a product at the end of the training, the video encourages booking a free call with a career coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[33:03]</a>. This business consistently gets 16-20 call bookings per day from this funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[33:32]</a>. The team uses Calendly for bookings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[36:22]</a>.

### Funnel Performance Metrics
For a specific funnel in June, the ad spend was approximately $80,000 (Facebook) and $6,000 (Google/YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[34:41]</a>. Total ad spend was about $86,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[35:05]</a>, generating a total revenue of $252,000 to $270,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[35:18]</a>. The return on investment (ROI) on ads was 38% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[35:32]</a>. From 339 call bookings, 273 people attended, resulting in 65 sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[35:42]</a>.

### Post-Conversion Strategy
Once leads are captured, they can be nurtured through email marketing campaigns, such as Black Friday sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[38:07]</a>. This often involves sending numerous emails to a segmented list of leads who haven't yet purchased, using tools like ConvertKit to manage engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[38:51]</a>. While this can lead to unsubscribes, the goal is to maximize sales while minimizing opt-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[39:51]</a>. Businesses with a strong "Goodwill bucket" of free content (e.g., extensive YouTube channels) can afford to be more aggressive with sales campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[40:40]</a>.

## Optimizing [[using_ai_to_optimize_funnel_performance | Funnel Performance]] and Conversion Rates
[[Role of personalization and interactivity in increasing conversions | Conversion rate optimization]] is an ongoing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[26:46]</a>. A funnel from day one to day 100 usually looks quite different due to continuous tweaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[27:29]</a>. Businesses should primarily focus on increasing their Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[26:21]</a>.

### The Role of Organic Content
While ads are crucial, it's beneficial to develop messaging and test it with organic content first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[20:31]</a>. Platforms like Twitter or Instagram can serve as "training wheels" to refine messaging before investing in paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[20:52]</a>. For older audiences, LinkedIn can be an effective platform for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[24:57]</a>.

Having a strong organic presence (e.g., high-quality YouTube content) builds trust and acts as a "shadow funnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[42:27]</a>. When someone sees an ad, they will often verify the business's legitimacy online; a strong content presence makes them more comfortable entering the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[42:31]</a>.

## Copywriting for Conversions
Copywriting is an essential and challenging aspect of building effective funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[38:38]</a>. Slight changes in copy can lead to massive differences in conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[44:09]</a>.

Two key copywriting hacks:
1.  **Increase Status:** Effective copy often highlights how a product or service will increase the user's status among their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[44:42]</a>. For instance, learning a skill that makes one more valuable at work increases perceived status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[45:11]</a>.
2.  **Pain vs. Pleasure:** Copy can either focus on moving people *away from pain* or *towards pleasure* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[46:12]</a>.
    *   **Away from Pain:** Reminds the audience of painful situations the product helps avoid (e.g., a portable microphone means "never get stuck without your podcast equipment again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[46:38]</a>). This approach is often more effective during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[47:05]</a>.
    *   **Towards Pleasure:** Highlights the positive attributes and benefits of the product (e.g., the beautiful design and nice sound of a microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[46:51]</a>). This approach is often more effective during prosperous times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[47:24]</a>.

These concepts are often found in "old school" marketing and copywriting books, which are still highly relevant today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[47:50]</a>.

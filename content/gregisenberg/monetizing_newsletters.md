Starting a newsletter can be a "cheat code" or a "hack" to build a dedicated audience, which can then serve as a foundation for various businesses, including marketplaces or agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Matt McGary, an expert who has helped clients gain 15.4 million email subscribers, shared 10 newsletter business ideas that can be launched quickly and potentially grow into multi-million dollar businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Newsletter Business Ideas & [[Monetization strategies for newsletters | Monetization Strategies]]

### 1. Marketing Newsletter for Global Talent
This idea targets overseas marketers seeking remote US-based marketing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The core audience for monetization is Western companies looking to hire talented overseas marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

**Monetization Methods:**
*   **Job Board:** Create a free job board where companies can post marketing jobs for overseas talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Companies can be charged $300 to $500 for a "boost" to feature jobs in the newsletter, reaching a large audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Targeted Sponsored Email Blasts:** By collecting subscriber data (work experience, job title, company, skills) at signup, targeted email blasts can be sent on behalf of job advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. These can be charged anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000 for a recruiting email blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Overseas Recruiting Agency Partnership:** Partnering with an existing overseas recruiting agency is an interesting avenue, as seen with Nick Huber's partnership with Somewhere.com (formerly Support Shepherd) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This allows leveraging the newsletter's audience to generate leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Courses:** Create a course focused on the international audience of marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

**Financial Model Example:**
*   Assume a $0.25 Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) for subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   With a $5,000/month budget, this yields 20,000 new subscribers per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   If charging $300 for a job posting and featuring 5 jobs per newsletter issue, that's $1,500 per issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   Sending 3 newsletters per week (12 per month) generates $18,000/month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   Five recruiting blasts per month at $2,000 each adds $10,000/month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   Total estimated revenue: $28,000 per month with an audience of 20,000 to 40,000 international marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### 2. Platform-Based Newsletter
This involves creating an educational newsletter focused on teaching people how to use a specific tool, platform, or program better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Examples include Ableton, DaVinci, Notion, Canva, Figma, Klaviyo, or Perplexity AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The key is to pick *one* tool and make the content digestible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

**Monetization Methods:**
*   **Affiliate Partnerships:** Become an affiliate partner for the platform, potentially earning 20% to 50% recurring commission for sending them customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Templates:** Create and sell templates related to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. For example, a HubSpot newsletter could offer a HubSpot template for subscribers, either for free with an affiliate signup link or for a direct purchase (e.g., $200) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Courses:** Build a course around mastering the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Software as a Service (SaaS) Tool Development:** Beyond finding SaaS tools that want to advertise to your readers, you can use AI coding platforms (like Repet, Bolt, VZ, Lovable) to build your own software tools to sell to your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### 3. Unofficial Sports Team Newsletter
This involves focusing on a sports team with a large fanbase but limited media coverage, such as a local, minor league, or college team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Content can be sourced by curating best takes from subreddits and forums, linking out to them, or inviting contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

**Monetization Methods:**
*   **Sponsorships:** Sell sponsorships to relevant businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Paid Community:** Create a paid Discord or Facebook Community for fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Scale Horizontally:** To achieve significant revenue, it might be necessary to create a dozen or more newsletters for multiple teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

### 4. Local Real Estate Investor Newsletter
This idea is for cities with 200,000 to 1 million people, targeting local real estate investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. The content would feature 10-20 high-quality investment property listings, enriched with mortgage rates and potential return forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Examples like The Offer Sheet (for Airbnb properties) have over 100,000 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

**Monetization Methods:**
*   **Sponsorships/Ads:**
    *   **Flat Fee per Clicks:** For 1,000 to 5,000 subscribers, approach local businesses with high Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) who work with real estate investors (lawyers, accountants, bankers, insurance brokers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
    *   Charge an upfront flat fee (e.g., $2,500) for an agreed amount of clicks (e.g., 500 clicks at $5 per click) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. This revenue can be reinvested into acquiring more subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
    *   Once 5,000 to 10,000 subscribers are reached, this framework can be replicated in nearby cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   **In-Person Seminars/Events:** Sell seats to local real estate investment seminars or events for $500 to $1,000 per seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.
*   **Premium Subscriptions:** Put 50% of the property listings behind a paywall, charging $1,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

**Financial Model Example:**
*   Assume a $2 CPA and a $5,000/month ad budget, yielding 2,500 new subscribers per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   Adding 20 subscribers per day from organic social media (600/month) brings total new subscribers to 3,100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   With an audience of 3,000 local real estate investors:
    *   Selling three $2,500 "500-click" ads per month: $7,500/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
    *   If 2% of a 5,000-person list purchases a $500 seminar: $50,000 in sales (not including event sponsorship revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
    *   If 1% of a 5,000-person list converts to a $1,000/year premium subscription: $50,000 Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   Total potential revenue: $190,000 with 5,000 to 10,000 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. This audience is highly sought after, making the business potentially sellable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

### 5. Newsletter for B2B Decision Makers
This type of newsletter targets specific B2B decision-makers, such as CEOs at Fortune 500 oil and gas companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. A small audience (e.g., 2,000 subscribers) of C-suite executives can be very valuable because sponsors are eager to reach them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. Content should be hyper-relevant, summarizing important press releases, product launches, hirings/firings, and earning reports into a 5-10 minute read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

**Monetization Methods:**
*   **Sponsorships:** The main monetization method, leveraging the high value of the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
    *   To gain leverage in selling sponsorships, it's crucial to survey subscribers (using tools like [[growing_and_monetizing_a_newsletter_using_beehive | Beehiiv]] survey forms) to determine the percentage of subscribers who fit the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), including their job title, industry, company, and location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.
*   **Software:** Create and sell software or tools directly to this high-value audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.
*   **Ads, Events, Courses:** These are also potential options, but software is highlighted as a strong alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

### 6. Niche Ad Examples for Media Buyers
This newsletter provides ad creative examples for specific niches within media buying (e.g., media companies, SaaS, info products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. Content involves creating a spreadsheet of niches, sourcing high-converting ads from platforms like Meta Ad Library (looking for long-running ads on high-spending accounts), and adding brief context to each ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

**Monetization Methods:**
*   **Paid Content:** Put 80% of the content behind a paywall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.
*   **Templates:** Create and sell Canva templates for each ad example that subscribers can download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   **Sponsorships:** Sell sponsorships to advertisers who want to target paid marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.
*   **Community/Membership/Course:** Sell access to a community, membership, or a course to the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

### 7. This Week in Memes (Visual Newsletters)
This concept involves explaining news with memes, focusing on business, finance, and technology for a prosumer niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. It entails finding a big story, pairing it with a relevant meme, and writing a concise summary (100-250 words) below the meme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. The focus is on creating more visual newsletters using memes, infographics, or GIFs to make content less like "work to read" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

**Monetization Methods:**
*   [[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | Prosumer content]] (B2B) generally offers more [[monetization_strategies_for_newsletters | monetization opportunities]] than general consumer content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. Specific strategies aren't detailed but implied to align with other prosumer-focused newsletters.

### 8. Industry-Specific AI Tips and Tactics
Modeled after "Write with AI" (a paid newsletter earning $200,000 ARR from subscriptions), this idea applies AI tips and tactics to specific industries like AI for marketers or AI for lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. The key is to provide "cheat codes" that help readers save time and money with AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.

**Monetization Methods:**
*   **Paid Subscriptions:** The primary method, as demonstrated by "Write with AI" ($200/year or $20/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
*   **Note:** While successful, the speaker questions if this can be achieved without an existing large social media audience, which "Write with AI" founders (Nicholas Cole and Dicky Bush) possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.

### 9. Lessons from Leaders or Inspirational Figures
This newsletter highlights lessons and insights from inspirational leaders (e.g., Warren Buffett) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. It's a great way to grow a broad audience quickly as the content often translates well to viral social media posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>. The format should be predictable and short (2-5 minutes max), with sections like "Best interview," "Best quote," "Best book," and "Best advice" from the profiled leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.

**Monetization Methods:**
*   While initially trickier to monetize due to a lack of clear niche, focusing on leaders who attract a "prosumer" audience (e.g., investors for Warren Buffett) opens up opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.
*   **Raising a Fund:** For an investor-focused niche, one could raise a hedge fund and become a "mini Warren Buffett" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.
*   **Consulting/Agency:** Offer consulting services, e.g., "how would Warren Buffett run your company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.
*   **Courses:** Sell courses related to the leader's expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.
*   **Stock Trading App:** Develop a stock trading app focused on the leader's principles (e.g., value investing for Warren Buffett) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.
*   **AI Agent:** Create a paid AI agent that optimizes portfolios like the featured leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

### 10. Local Newsletters
This addresses the gap in digestible, positive, community-oriented local news, moving away from crime-heavy traditional media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. An example is a "things to do this weekend" newsletter highlighting local events, live music, food, and fun activities, including those not typically found online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.

**Monetization Methods:**
*   **Local Sponsorships:** Seek sponsorships from high Lifetime Value (LTV) local businesses like lawyers, realtors, and wealth managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
*   Local newsletters can grow to six-figure businesses in one city and scale to seven figures by expanding into multiple cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.
*   Examples include Naptown Scoop ($400K/year in revenue covering Annapolis, Maryland), 6AM City ($8 million in revenue with 1.4 million subscribers), and The Charlotte Agenda (acquired by Axios for approximately $5 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. The key insights are to keep content positive, community-oriented, and curated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.

## General Strategies for [[Monetization strategies for newsletters | Monetizing Newsletters]]
Beyond specific ideas, general strategies for [[Monetization Strategies Beyond Ads | monetizing newsletters]] include:
*   **Selling Ads and Events:** These are common starting points for newsletter businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
*   **Selling Software:** Building and selling software products to your audience is a highly recommended monetization strategy, especially when catering to audiences with disposable income or those in charge of budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. AI coding platforms (like Repet or Bolt) can assist in creating these products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>.
*   **Audience Growth and Data Collection:**
    *   **Collecting Subscriber Data:** Beyond just emails, collecting data like work experience, job title, company, and skills is crucial for understanding your audience and selling targeted sponsorships or products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
    *   **Paid Acquisition:** Using platforms like Facebook ads to acquire subscribers can be effective, even at lower price points like $0.25-$2 CPA, depending on the niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   **Organic Growth:** Simultaneously [[building_an_audience_for_newsletters | building an audience]] on social media platforms (TikTok, Instagram, X) through value-added posts and "pre-call to action" (pre-CTA) or "post-call to action" (post-CTA) strategies helps reduce reliance on paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The goal is for organic growth to eventually surpass paid acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **High-Value Audience:** Focusing on audiences with "disposable income" or those "in charge of budgets" can lead to "beautiful businesses" with high revenue potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.
*   **Scalability:** Many newsletter models allow for horizontal scaling, meaning the same framework can be applied to new niches or geographies once successful in one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Exit Opportunities:** Newsletters with highly sought-after audiences can be valuable assets for acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

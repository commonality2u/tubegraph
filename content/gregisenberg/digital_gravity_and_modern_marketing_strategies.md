The traditional marketing funnel is an "entirely wrong way to think about marketing" in the modern era, as it deceptively hides what is actually happening in customer purchasing journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Instead of a linear path where people enter and exit, customers interact with a brand, move away, get "sucked back in," rotate around it multiple times, and then finally convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This dynamic behavior necessitates a new model: **Digital Gravity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## What is Digital Gravity?
[[Digital Gravity and modern marketing strategies | Digital Gravity]] is a concept that describes how brands are built by accumulating "digital mass" on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The more digital mass a company has, the more influence it wields within its niche or sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This mass attracts customers, pulling them into the brand's orbit, leading to more "touchdowns" (conversions) and ultimately revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This creates a growth flywheel where revenue can be reinvested to build even more mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Building Digital Mass
Digital mass is primarily built through content and by marketing "everywhere that your customer is showing up" online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Resource Allocation
Marketing resource allocation depends on a company's funding status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>:
*   **Funded Startups:** Have significant money, time, and resources, allowing them to be "everywhere" their customer is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapped Startups:** Typically have more time and mental energy but little money, requiring a more focused approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Continuous Marketing vs. Campaigns
Modern marketing should not be viewed as "campaigns," a term held over from military strategy (World War II) that implies a start and an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Instead, companies should adopt a mindset of "you're marketing," meaning marketing is a continuous, ongoing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This continuous effort constantly adds mass to the company, shifting the mindset from finite actions to continuous growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The only exception that isn't malleable once sent is email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## B2B Marketing Playbook (Tactical)
For B2B companies, with typically smaller target audiences (e.g., 50,000 people), the following tactics contribute to building digital gravity:

1.  **Audience Identification and Email Scraping:**
    *   Identify the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
    *   Scrape their emails using tools like Apollo.io or even LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

2.  **Targeted Paid Advertising:**
    *   Import scraped emails into Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads to create custom match lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
    *   Run ads indefinitely in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
    *   Utilize [[aidriven_content_marketing_strategies | AI Avatar Ads]] (e.g., HeyGen for avatars, ElevenLabs for voice) targeting pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
    *   Create 100+ variations of ads (different hooks, settings, backgrounds, pain points) and continuously test them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Allocate 80% of the budget to best-performing ads and 20% to ongoing testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
    *   Founders appearing in ads or creating digital clones can increase visibility and famousness, as people buy from people, not brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

3.  **Cold Email Strategies:**
    *   Cold email the entire scraped list using tools like MailReef (for specialized AWS servers) or SmartLead/Instantly AI for sending software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
    *   **Email Domain Isolation:** Use separate domains for transactional emails (core app domain), newsletter emails (separate domain), and cold emails (multiple inboxes/domains) to prevent flags from impacting critical communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
    *   Cold emails should mirror the problem-solution orientation of ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
    *   The goal is to land as much email as possible in inboxes, as customers may search their email later for solutions when problems arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
    *   Cold email works, especially when messaging is specific to the target audience's problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

4.  **Building a Media Company (Owned Media):**
    *   [[Building and leveraging marketing communities | Create a podcast]] by recording customer conversations about their pain points and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
    *   Send weekly podcast episodes as a [[digital_marketing_strategies_for_newsletters | newsletter]] to the entire scraped email list (e.g., using MailerLite, Beehiiv, SendGrid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
    *   This provides valuable, educational, industry-specific content, building a "top of funnel" relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.
    *   Owned media creates significant leverage for negotiation and can become a profit center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. For example, a startup used its successful podcast to negotiate better deals with lab companies and subsidize its entire growth team through ad placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.

5.  **Content Repurposing and Social Media:**
    *   Utilize podcast audio/video to create diverse content (e.g., Swell AI can transcribe, clip, and generate show notes and media assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
    *   Repurpose into blog posts, white papers, and short-form video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.
    *   Distribute these across all platforms where customers spend time (LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
    *   **Instagram-only ads:** Run ads with a call to action in the caption to "follow this account for more content like this," targeting impressions to grow followers cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
    *   Growing social media accounts provides free impressions, reducing reliance on paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. Ads that feel like content perform better and cost less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.

### The Power of the B2B Playbook
When these elements are combined, within 12 months, a company can have:
*   Massive ad remarketing and top-of-funnel reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.
*   A weekly newsletter from a podcast, negotiating better deals through owned media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
*   Daily social media presence across all channels, showing up consistently in the lives of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
This "grindy" but not "hard" work leads to exponential growth and significant competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>. An example shared illustrates an email newsletter generating 80,000 clicks per month for $450, while traditional ads for the same audience would cost $500,000 â€“ an incredible arbitrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## B2C Marketing Playbook (Tactical)
Consumer marketing is "a different animal," more competitive, and requires being "unbelievable at marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

1.  **Large Total Addressable Market (TAM):**
    *   Consumer products require a huge TAM to justify the broad content needed to target a large subset of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.

2.  **Application Focus and Pricing:**
    *   Build an application that people want, often focusing on a single function done exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
    *   Consider impulse purchase pricing (e.g., $7.99/week or $29/month) which can generate significant revenue over three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

3.  **Paid Advertising and [[Influencer Marketing Strategies | Influencer Marketing]]:**
    *   Focus on Facebook Ads and TikTok Ads, optimizing for app installs and in-app conversion events (e.g., sign-up or paid action) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
    *   Create many ad variations and continuously test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
    *   **UGC Creators:** Hire 5-10 UGC creators (e.g., for $1,000/month for daily videos) to act as a testbed for viral content related to the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>.
    *   Content should have a hook, address a pain point, and present the product as the hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. The goal is for ads to feel like entertaining and educational content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.

4.  **Multi-Account Strategy for Short-Form Social:**
    *   Spin up multiple TikTok accounts (e.g., 10 different ones) and create variations of best-performing UGC content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
    *   Remix content with AI (ChatGPT for scripts, HeyGen for videos, ElevenLabs for audio) and use tools like CapCut for visual effects (e.g., green screen removal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.

5.  **Website Optimization and Remarketing:**
    *   Choose a unique product name to avoid competition on Google search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
    *   Install pixels (Facebook, TikTok, Google) on the website to enable indefinite remarketing to visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.
    *   Include email sign-up options on the website for an email nurture sequence that upsells the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

6.  **[[Influencer Marketing Strategies | Influencer Outreach]] and Affiliate Plays:**
    *   Scrape emails of creators/channels in your category from YouTube bios or Instagram (e.g., using IGleads.io) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.
    *   Conduct cold email outreach to inquire about their pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.
    *   Identify "Arbitrage" by comparing average views to suggested costs in the imperfect influencer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.
    *   Structure deals with a three-video package (to build audience trust) plus a recurring affiliate commission (e.g., 30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. This creates "stickiness" and a moat against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
    *   Paying creators for content allows for a significantly cheaper CPM (e.g., $5 CPM vs. average $10 CPM on TikTok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

7.  **Programmatic SEO:**
    *   Leverage programmatic SEO once the app's domain authority (DA) reaches around 40+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. DA is measured by trusted backlinks from other websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>.
    *   Identify long-tail keywords with low difficulty related to your product (e.g., diet plans, calorie counts for a calorie-tracking app) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.
    *   Scrape top-ranking content for those keywords, generate blog post outlines with AI (e.g., section by section for quality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.
    *   Publish a high volume of articles (e.g., 10,000) using AI. For aggressive growth, edits can happen after a page gets its first human session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.
    *   Ensure content appeals to both Google's ranking algorithms and human readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.
    *   Strategically place calls to action (CTAs) within the article (e.g., after the first paragraph, visible in every scroll frame) and use pop-ups at 25-50% scroll depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.
    *   Pixel all website visitors to add them to remarketing funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

### Conclusion
By implementing these comprehensive strategies across both B2B and B2C, companies can create significant digital gravity, continuously attract and convert customers, and build sustainable, exponential growth. The focus shifts from isolated campaigns to an integrated, always-on marketing ecosystem that maximizes touchpoints and leverages owned media as powerful assets.

The music industry is leveraging AI to create and execute highly targeted ad campaigns, moving beyond traditional, broad marketing approaches. This shift allows artists and management teams to connect more effectively with their fan bases and optimize promotional efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

## Lelo: A CRM for Creators and Artists

Lelo is an emerging CRM (Customer Relationship Management) platform specifically designed for creators and music artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. It functions as a "drop CRM" and integrates various communication channels, including SMS, email, and Instagram DMs, with plans to expand to platforms like TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

For instance, artist Zach Bryan utilized Lelo for his last tour to notify a large list of fans when tickets dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. This platform also enables exclusive access for list subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. Major record labels are currently transitioning to Lelo, highlighting its growing influence in the music industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

There is a significant opportunity to establish a "Lelo agency" to help artists and their teams effectively utilize the platform, especially since many currently struggle with list growth strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## Strategies for Targeted Ad Campaigns

### Audience Matching and Giveaways

A successful strategy involves using Instagram audience matching to target users who have previously engaged with an artist's account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. Giveaway ads, such as offering $100 worth of merchandise for signing up, have proven highly effective, often resulting in sign-up costs under a dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. This approach leverages existing fan interest to build valuable contact lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

### Geo-Targeting for Tours

Advertisers can strategically target specific geographic locations, particularly for upcoming tours. By running ads only in the areas where an artist is scheduled to perform, they can build a localized mailing list for those venues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. This allows for precise communication when tickets drop, maximizing sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

### [[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | Personalization with AI]]

The marketing landscape is shifting from "one-size-fits-all" to highly personalized approaches, especially with the integration of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. For ad creatives, artists can record multiple script variations as selfie videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. These variations can then be tested to identify which ones yield the cheapest CPC (Cost Per Click) and sign-up rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

AI can further enhance personalization by:
*   **Dynamic Backgrounds** The artist's recorded video background can be removed and replaced with stock or AI-generated footage of the specific venue or city being targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. This mirrors strategies seen in other viral apps, where location-specific content significantly increases engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
*   **Targeted Messaging** Ads can feature messages like "I'm coming to your city" combined with location-specific backgrounds, fostering a stronger connection with the local audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

## The Role of Agencies and Future Trends

Despite the traditional perception of the music business as a difficult area for startups, opportunities exist, particularly in service-based models like specialized web design agencies for artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. These agencies can secure recurring revenue through website renewals with each album drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

Management companies are increasingly functioning as "growth agencies" or media teams for artists, taking on responsibilities traditionally held by labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. This shift empowers artists and their management to drive their own marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

### AI in Ad Platforms

Platforms like Facebook's ad system are already heavily reliant on AI to optimize campaigns. Marketers can simply define a desired conversion action, and Facebook's AI will efficiently find the target audience and deliver results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. This capability effectively turns the ad platform into an "agent" that achieves specific goals, a core concept in [[using_ai_for_ad_creation_and_strategy | AI-driven marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. While Google Ads still benefits from manual keyword optimization, Facebook's AI can often outperform human efforts for broad consumer products by finding the right audience faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.

API tokens are essential for interacting with various services and models when developing AI applications. Understanding their purpose, management, and associated security concerns is crucial for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

## Why API Tokens Are Needed
Most APIs require an API token because the services they provide are not free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. For instance, generating an image might cost two to three cents per piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. These tokens allow providers to track usage and bill the correct user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

## Security Considerations for API Tokens
Managing API tokens involves several security considerations to prevent unauthorized access and unexpected costs.

### Concealing Tokens
It is critical to keep API tokens concealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. If someone obtains your token, they could use your API key and potentially incur significant bills for your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This has happened in recorded instances when tokens were accidentally revealed in videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

### Setting Usage Limits (Cost Cap)
Platforms like Firebase allow you to set limits on potential costs, such as a $20 cap, which is useful when starting out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. This feature can protect against attacks where malicious actors overload your database or image model with scripts, preventing extreme billing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>.

### Authorized Domains for Authentication
When deploying an application that uses authentication, like [[using_firebase_for_authentication_and_database_management | Firebase Authentication]], you must authorize the domains where your application will run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:43">[01:09:43]</a>. While local development environments (Localhost) are often automatically authorized, deployed applications require their specific domain to be added to the authorized domains list in your Firebase project settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. If a domain is not authorized, authentication will fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.

## Practical Management with AI Tools
When using AI tools like Cursor for [[ai_app_development_strategies | app development]], the process of managing API tokens can be streamlined:

*   **Automatic Placement:** Cursor can automatically place API tokens in the correct environment files, such as `.env.local` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This is particularly helpful for beginners who may not know where to manually place these sensitive keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. The code then references these keys from the environment variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **Providing Context to AI:** When working with APIs using an AI assistant, it's important to provide comprehensive information, including:
    *   Clear instructions for the desired functionality (e.g., "create an image generator") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
    *   Code examples for using the API, often found in API documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
    *   The API token itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
*   **Debugging with AI:** If an API call fails, providing the error message and additional documentation (e.g., links to API docs or playground examples) to the AI assistant can help it identify and fix the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. The AI agent can even read information directly from provided links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

## Costs Associated with API Usage
When building applications that leverage AI models through APIs, it's important to consider the operational costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. For example, generating images costs money per piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Database services like Firebase are free to start, but costs can increase significantly as your application gains popularity and usage scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

Traditional marketing funnels are considered an outdated and deceptive way to approach modern marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Instead, a new perspective, termed [[the_concept_of_digital_gravity_in_marketing | Digital Gravity]], offers a more accurate visualization of how people interact with brands and make purchasing decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Understanding Digital Gravity

[[the_concept_of_digital_gravity_in_marketing | Digital Gravity]] proposes that brand building involves creating "digital mass" on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The more digital mass a brand accumulates, the greater its influence within its specific niche or sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This mass is primarily built through consistent content creation and pervasive marketing efforts across all platforms where customers are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### The Flaw in the Funnel
The traditional marketing funnel, where people enter at the top and exit as buyers at the bottom, does not reflect actual consumer behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. In reality, people interact with a brand, move away, get "sucked back in," rotate around it multiple times, and then eventually make a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. They frequently leave and re-enter the "funnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, sometimes buying weeks or even years later after multiple brand touchpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Continuous Marketing, Not Campaigns
The concept of "campaigns" in marketing is a holdover from military terminology, implying a start and end point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Modern marketing, however, is a continuous process; brands are constantly marketing, not just running finite campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This ongoing effort is crucial for continually adding digital mass to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### The Digital Gravity Analogy
Imagine a company as a small spec, and a customer as a comet flying by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Initially, the small spec has no influence on the comet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. However, as the company builds more mass, it becomes a "planet," attracting more "comets" (customers) into its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. These comets rotate around the planet, leading to "touchdowns" that generate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This revenue then creates a growth flywheel, allowing reinvestment to build even more mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This model applies to local businesses, B2B, and consumer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Tactical Strategies for B2B

To build a B2B company using digital mass, the strategy focuses on gaining significant influence within a smaller, targeted audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### 1. Audience Identification & Email Scraping
*   Identify a target audience, often around 50,000 individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   Scrape their emails using tools like Apollo.io or even LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This initial list identifies your potential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### 2. Paid Advertising
*   Import the scraped email list into advertising platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads as custom match lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Facebook Ads typically match 30-40% of emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   Run ads indefinitely to these matched audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Ad Content**: Use UGC AI Avatar ads (e.g., HeyGen for avatars, Eleven Labs for voice) to address target audience pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Create a digital clone of the founder to build founder fame within the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Testing**: Develop 100 variations of ads with different hooks, settings, backgrounds, and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Allocate 80% of the budget to the best-performing ads (lowest CPC) and 20% for continuous testing to find new winning variants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The goal is to create ads that feel like content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>.

### 3. Cold Email Outreach
*   Use tools like MailReef (for server management) and Smartlead or Instantly AI (for sending) to cold email every person on the scraped list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **Domain Isolation**: Maintain separate domains for transactional emails (from the core app domain), newsletter emails, and cold emails to prevent a compromised cold email domain from affecting critical product communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   The cold emails should mirror the ad content, focusing on problem-solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
*   Cold email remains effective when tailored to specific, niche problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

### 4. [[Building a media arm to leverage brand growth and influence | Building a Media Arm]]
*   **Podcast Creation**: Record customer conversations to identify pain points and valuable insights, then turn these into a podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. Send out new episodes weekly to your scraped email list via services like MailerLite or Beehiiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
*   **Content Repurposing**: Use tools like Swell AI to transcribe podcast audio, extract pain points, create blog posts, white papers, show notes, and media assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   **Social Media Distribution**: Schedule these content clips across all relevant platforms where customers spend time online (e.g., LinkedIn, Instagram) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Short-form content from TikTok or Instagram Reels can go viral on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Audience Growth**: Run Instagram-only ads with a call to action to follow the account for more content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. This can acquire followers at a low cost (e.g., 30 cents per follower at one point) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. The larger the social account, the more free impressions you receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Convert the media arm from a cost center into a profit center by selling ad placements on the podcast and in the newsletter to relevant companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. This can subsidize the entire growth team's cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

### The B2B Growth Flywheel
By layering these strategies—remarketing, cold emails, a weekly podcast newsletter, daily social media posts, and active engagement—a company can go from non-existent to an industry presence in 12 months, where people recognize and appreciate their brand and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. This consistent effort, while "grindy," leads to exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>. For example, one company grew its email list to 130,000 in 18 months, driving 80,000 website clicks monthly from newsletters at a cost of $450, compared to a traditional ad spend of $500,000 for the same traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.

> "Everybody in B2B should be creating a media business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
> Notable examples of companies with powerful media arms include Aero Electronics and Red Bull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. Y Combinator also functions as a media company that sells venture capital, evidenced by their significant investment in YouTube content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

## Tactical Strategies for Consumer (B2C)

Consumer marketing is highly competitive, requiring exceptional marketing skills and a large Total Addressable Market (TAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>.

### 1. App Development & Pricing
*   Develop an application that solves a single problem exceptionally well for a large audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
*   Consider a pricing strategy like $7.99/week (translates to ~$29/month) for impulse purchases, which can yield three months of revenue from a single transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

### 2. Paid Advertising for Apps
*   Focus on Facebook Ads and TikTok Ads for app installs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   Set up conversion events for deep links leading to app installs and key in-app actions (e.g., signup, paid actions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.
*   Test numerous ad variations to find content that resonates as native content, rather than an obvious advertisement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

### 3. [[Influencer marketing strategies | Influencer Marketing]] and UGC
*   Hire 5-10 UGC (User-Generated Content) creators who can produce a video a day and cross-post across multiple accounts for about $1,000/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>. This acts as a test bed for viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>.
*   Create 10 different TikTok accounts and remix the best-performing UGC content using AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT for scripts, HeyGen for video, Eleven Labs for audio, CapCut for editing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
*   **Influencer Outreach**:
    *   Scrape emails from YouTube or Instagram (e.g., using tools like IGleads.io for hashtags/keywords) for creators in your category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.
    *   Cold email them to inquire about their pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.
    *   Analyze views versus cost to find pricing discrepancies and arbitrage opportunities in the imperfect influencer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.
    *   Structure deals with a three-video package (to build audience trust) and an affiliate commission (e.g., 30% recurring) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>. This creates a "moat" by making creators financially invested in your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>.

### 4. Programmatic SEO
*   As the app's website gains domain authority (trust from Google due to backlinks), implement programmatic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
*   **Content Generation**: Scrape top-ranking content for longtail, low-competition keywords related to your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. Use AI tools to generate blog post outlines and draft articles section by section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.
*   **Publishing Strategy**: Publish a large volume of articles (e.g., 10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. Once a page gets traffic, have a human SEO or content specialist refine it to optimize for both Google's ranking factors and human readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.
*   **Calls to Action (CTAs)**: Include CTAs to sign up for the app after the first paragraph, ensure at least one call out is visible within every scroll frame (mobile/desktop), and implement a full-screen pop-up CTA at 25-50% scroll rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>.

### 5. Website Pixel and Nurture
*   Pixel anyone who lands on your website (e.g., Facebook, TikTok, Google pixels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. This allows for indefinite retargeting ads to them on those platforms, pulling them into a remarketing funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
*   Collect emails on the website for an email nurture sequence that upsells them into the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.

By layering these tactics, brands can continually build "digital mass," drawing more customers into their orbit and driving significant revenue through consistent and pervasive marketing efforts.

This business idea focuses on creating a [[building_a_successful_youtube_channel_and_media_presence | YouTube channel]] that offers tutorials on how to use Canva, which serves as a lead generation funnel for a design agency utilizing offshore talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## The Core Concept

The fundamental idea is to leverage the significant search volume for "how to" content related to Canva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. By consistently publishing videos demonstrating specific Canva tasks, the channel establishes itself as a helpful resource. This approach is similar to [[starting_a_servicebased_business_using_google_ads | teaching how to set up Google Ads]] for various businesses, where the educational content naturally leads to service inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The strategy involves:
*   Starting a [[building_a_successful_youtube_channel_and_media_presence | YouTube channel]] focused on Canva tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Filming a daily video that shows users how to perform specific tasks corresponding to high-volume search keywords (e.g., "how to do XYZ on Canva") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Making these videos long-format (e.g., 20 minutes to 2 hours) to provide detailed, step-by-step tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The current trend suggests that "long form is winning right now" for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Business Model & Lead Generation

This [[leveraging_youtube_as_a_top_of_funnel_for_business_growth | YouTube channel]] acts as a "top of funnel" for a design agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. After watching a detailed tutorial, viewers who lack the time or desire to implement the steps themselves will naturally seek to hire someone, creating a "natural inbound" lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This also helps develop a deep relationship with potential clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

The agency part of the model relies on hiring offshore talent, particularly those skilled in Canva, allowing for "unlimited design on Canva" services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This structure can be scaled from a single creator servicing clients to managing hundreds of clients with a team of individual managers and workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies

This business model offers at least three ways to monetize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>:

1.  **Agency Services (Primary):** The core revenue comes from clients hiring the agency for Canva design work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. An agency structured this way, publishing a video a day, could potentially achieve an 80% margin and generate $80,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
2.  **[[using_youtube_as_a_business_tool | YouTube Ad Revenue]]:** The channel itself can generate ad revenue from video views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
3.  **Newsletter Ads:** By building a newsletter from the [[building_an_audience_on_youtube | YouTube audience]], new video drops can be announced via email. The newsletter can then sell advertising slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
4.  **Affiliate Marketing:** This is a "huge opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. SaaS products often offer 10% to 50% of monthly recurring revenue for referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. By naturally including these products in workflows and linking them in video descriptions, a recurring revenue stream can be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Canva itself has an affiliate program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Individuals in the print-on-demand space are reportedly generating $500,000 annually from courses, YouTube ad revenue, and primarily, affiliate income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Even large companies like Adobe have "killer affiliate programs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Scalability & Future Opportunities

This model is highly scalable. A consistent daily video publication over six months could lead to a "million-dollar company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Beyond the agency, there's a natural progression to developing software:
*   **Canva App Development:** As limitations within Canva are identified (e.g., poor captioning tools), an entrepreneur could develop a specific Canva app to solve these problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Pre-built Audience:** The existing [[building an audience on YouTube | YouTube channel]] and newsletter provide an immediate audience for new software products, accelerating adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Creator → Agency → Software Progression:** This pathway is a repeatable strategy that can be applied across various niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. For example, a captioning software for Canva videos, leveraging AI for transcription, presents a specific opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

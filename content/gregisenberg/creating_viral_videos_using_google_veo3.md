Many creators are discussing Google Veo3, but few demonstrate how to monetize it. This article details an A-to-Z tutorial on how to create viral content and build a business using Veo3, shared by expert PJ, who consistently goes viral with his AI films on platforms like X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Virality and Engagement
The digital landscape is flooded with content, a "deluge" that is only intensifying with generative AI, making content 10x to 100x more abundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Therefore, the ability to create engaging content that prompts viewers to watch, share, and act is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. It's not just about technical skill but understanding *why* people engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## The Viral Video Creation Process

### 1. Idea Generation
The process begins with a "kernel of an idea hook" â€“ something unique and unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. For example, PJ's viral pharmaceutical ad started as a standard commercial request, but he grew "bored halfway through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. He decided to "go left field" and introduce the idea of a placebo pill that actually ships a dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This evolved into the idea of a pill secreting pheromones to attract puppies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

ðŸ’¡ **Leveraging LLMs for Ideas**:
Even if you don't have a unique kernel, you can ask tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok to generate ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. For satirical content, specify inspiration like "SNL style" or "Tim and Eric show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. You can also ask for "five different twists" on a commercial idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. PJ recommends experimenting with two to three different models, noting Grok's "unhinged mode" for more outlandish results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### 2. Scripting
PJ starts by giving ChatGPT generalized instructions for a cliche script, then iteratively refines it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. For the pharmaceutical ad, the initial prompt included details like:
*   A fake medication for depression with "pup" in the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   Follows a 20-second prescription commercial format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   Starts with people battling depression, then introduces the "pup" pill that delivers a puppy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   Should be an "SNL style satirical take" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

The key is to ask for multiple prompt versions and then take the best lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. By constantly refeeding favorite lines and directing the LLM to be "comedic," "unhinged," or "non-sequiturs," you can generate a high percentage of usable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Approximately 70% of the lines in PJ's viral ad were ChatGBT-generated through this iterative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

ðŸ’¡ **Outsourcing "Taste"**: If you lack a comedic sense, you can ask the LLM to "create jokes in the style of Seth Rogen" or "imagine you're Bill Burr doing a standup comedy routine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

### 3. Prompting for Veo3
Once the script is locked, create individual prompts for each dialogue line. PJ uses a prompt structure that describes the scene, character, emotion, pose, shot type, camera type, and background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Veo3 doesn't require overly complicated prompts; a simple description of what's happening and the dialogue is often sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

For generating video:
*   Use the "VO3" (Veo3) model for the highest quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   Only generate one output per prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
*   Avoid including quotes in your prompts to reduce the likelihood of generating weird gibberish subtitles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.
*   Run prompts one at a time due to cost (approx. $2-3 per shot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
*   Refine prompts iteratively if the output isn't right (e.g., adjusting for character actions or settings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

â›” **Limitations of Veo3**:
*   **Audio inconsistency**: Sometimes audio is generated, sometimes not, and it can be "whack" or "thin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Character consistency**: There is currently no stable character consistency. To achieve a similar look, describe characters in detail the same way every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   **Image-to-video**: The image-to-video feature is not yet highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

PJ's pharmaceutical ad cost about $500 in Veo3 credits, significantly less than a traditional $100k-$1M pharmaceutical commercial shoot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. He generated around 30 clips to get 10 good ones, a 3:1 ratio (or 5:1 considering clips not downloaded) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

### 4. Editing
Once clips are generated, PJ uses editing software like Final Cut Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.
*   **Alternatives**: [[video_generation_and_editing_using_ai | Cap Cut]] is a viable free option, as is DaVinci Resolve for more advanced editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
*   **Camera Movements**: Prompting for camera movements (e.g., "dolly in," "push in") makes the shots feel less AI-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   **Emotional Detail**: You can get granular with details, prompting not just actions but also character emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

## Distribution and the "Hook"
Creating the video is only half the battle; the "hook" is paramount for virality, especially on platforms like X (Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

> "Mr. Beast... always talks about like the the title of the video is more important than the thumbnail. And the thumbnail is more important than the actual content of the video because if he can't get you to like hook you on the title, he's not going to get you to really engage with the thumbnail. And if he doesn't hook you on the thumbnail, he's not going to get you to watch the full video." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>

For X, the headline has 0.2 seconds to hook someone, and the content has 2-3 seconds to make them stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.

### Elements of a Strong Hook (using PJ's pharmaceutical ad example):
*   **Low-key Flex**: "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials." This establishes credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
*   **Shocking Cost Comparison**: "I made this for $500 in V3 credits in less than a day." The dramatic cost difference ($500k vs. $500) creates intrigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.
*   **Trendjacking**: Mentioning "V3" taps into current trending topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
*   **Question**: "What's the argument for spending 500K now?" Questions drive replies and feed the algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition**: "Steal my prompt below." This encourages clicks, signaling engagement to the algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.

PJ's other viral hooks follow a similar pattern:
*   "AI video quality just 10xed overnight. I'm speechless. Cling 2.0 just dropped and I've already burned through $1,200 in credits testing its limits. I've never seen motion this fluid or this accurate. Here's how I made this video step by step." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>
*   "What if Studio Gibli directed Lord of the Rings? I spent 250 in cling credits and 9 hours editing the Fellowship trailer. And I'll show you exactly how I did it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>
*   Avoid generic clickbait phrases like "Hollywood is cooked" and find your own "provocative statement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies for Generative AI Content

### 1. Build a Personal Brand
Use Veo3 to create content you're proud of, establishing yourself within the ecosystem. This can lead to downstream work and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

### 2. Attract Direct Clients
Create similar commercials for brands or agencies. Identify niches that would benefit from unique, unhinged special effects that traditional agencies couldn't provide within budget. Examples include food products, beer companies, or underwear brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. You can charge $5,000+ for such content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

### 3. Build a Portfolio for Agencies
Create a niche portfolio (e.g., knife commercials, boot commercials) to attract agencies. You can learn by copying award-winning commercials shot-for-shot internally, using LLMs to break down screenshots into prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. Then, apply these templates to adjacent products to develop your own unique voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.

### 4. Create a Narrative Series with Brand Integrations
Develop an original universe or concept, like Neural Viz's "moniverse" featuring aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>. Brands can then integrate their products as "artifacts" or elements within this universe. This is a powerful way to monetize beyond standard commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>. Find a popular social format (e.g., "Man on the street," Zillow tours, Joe Rogan set) and add a unique twist using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

### 5. Sell Courses or Digital Products
If you have expertise, package your knowledge into courses, PDFs, or other digital products related to AI video creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

### 6. Consulting with Larger Companies
Offer consulting services to Fortune 500 companies on integrating generative AI content while adhering to legal and compliance constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Charge based on the scale of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

### 7. Build a Sketch Comedy Channel
Create a "Key & Peele style" sketch comedy show. While monetization can be challenging, platforms like TikTok show it's possible with enough audience, often through product integrations within the comedy bits (e.g., Bang energy drinks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.

### 8. Create Narrative Films (with caveats)
While possible (PJ is working on a 25-minute TV show), long-form narrative content is not highly recommended for generative AI currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. The technology iterates too fast, leading to inconsistent quality from start to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. The focus should be on episodic weekly content, which aligns better with modern consumption habits and requires smaller budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.

### 9. Pitch Brands on Narrative Content
Propose creating brand-specific narrative series (e.g., a 10-episode series with a brand's products as "relics") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

### 10. Pick a Small Sub-Niche
Identify underserved niches with high demand and low supply. An example is faith-based content (e.g., Bible stories), which has a large built-in audience and a high appetite for new content, even at lower quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. Another example is "BookTok" or "Romantasy Talk" â€“ creating book promos or scenes from books for authors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

## Key Takeaways
*   **Do what fascinates you**: Lean into your unique interests and "weirdness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
*   **Copy frameworks**: Learn from successful content by copying their structures and applying them to your niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>.
*   **Focus on a niche**: An audience in a niche is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.
*   **Serve underserved markets**: AI tools allow for high-cinematography content at a fraction of the cost, opening doors to niches that couldn't afford traditional agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.

This article provides a baseline understanding of how to use AI in writing, offering a clear framework for producing high-quality long-form content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Understanding these frameworks allows writers to apply them to various content types, including emails, articles, Twitter threads, and landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## The Evolving Landscape of Writing with AI

The world is rapidly moving towards integrating AI into creative processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Just as Photoshop didn't ruin design but created exponentially more designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, and Instagram made everyone a photographer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, AI writing platforms like ChatGPT and Claude are reducing the barrier to entry, effectively making everyone a writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

The demand for branded and educational content is constantly increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. AI becomes a tool that allows writers to double, triple, or quadruple their output, becoming more valuable in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. It's not that AI takes jobs; it changes the baseline skill level, requiring writers to adapt to new tools and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Core Principles of AI-Assisted Writing

It's crucial to recognize that AI is not a silver bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Users must have a baseline understanding of how writing works to effectively prompt AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Starting with an Idea

Most writing processes begin with a "seed of an idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The first decision is to determine if this idea is the *main theme* of the piece or a *sub-point* within a larger idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. For example, a specific rule from Netflix's early days could be the article's focus, or it could be one point within a piece about "three CEOs who had strange rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Defining Goals and Prompts

Before writing, establish clear goals for the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. These goals can then be plugged into AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude to generate initial ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

There are two primary ways to interact with AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>:
1.  **Conversationally:** Chunking things out piece by piece in a dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
2.  **Massive Prompt:** Assembling a comprehensive prompt with all potential situations and hypotheticals to generate a specific output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

For initial ideation, starting conversationally is often best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. The goal is for AI to feed ideas, not to start writing immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

### Deferring Low-Leverage Tasks

AI can take over lower-leverage tasks, such as generating multiple iterations of headlines or main points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This process mirrors how an editor might ask a columnist for various ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. By feeding these requests to AI, writers elevate themselves to "editor-in-chief," focusing on taste and discerning which ideas work best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

## Structuring Content with Frameworks

Many critical decisions about a piece of writing are made *before* the actual writing begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. This significantly simplifies the writing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

### Template-Based Content Creation

Utilizing existing successful hooks or formats as templates is a powerful technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. This involves "stealing the architecture" (the bones of the house) rather than the content itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. This isn't "real writing" in the traditional sense, but it formalizes an intuitive process writers already use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

By taking an original successful hook and manually creating a new version based on a different idea, you create a "mini-model" that AI can learn from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. This enables you to prompt AI for variations, constantly improving the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

### The 800-Word Article Structure

A typical 800-word article often consists of an introduction followed by three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. The value of a piece is primarily determined by the quality of its headline and the three main points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. If the main points aren't specific and tangible, readers will quickly deem the content worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.

### The 10 Magical Ways Framework

This framework helps overcome writer's block by categorizing the type of information being given to the reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. Examples include:
*   Tips
*   Stats
*   Steps
*   Lessons
*   Reasons why
*   Examples

By clarifying *which* of these 10 things you will give the reader, you make the promise in the headline more tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>. The subheads should directly deliver on the promise made in the headline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. For example, if the headline promises "three lessons," the subheads should clearly state "Lesson One," "Lesson Two," and "Lesson Three" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.

The highest leverage decision is the quality of these three main points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>. It's recommended to try to come up with these points yourself first, then use AI to stress-test their quality and generate more batches of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. This iterative process of working *with* AI, rather than deferring writing to it, leads to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

Subheads should be written as clear, tangible sentences that provide immediate value, rather than vague or clever titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.

Once the three main points are finalized, revisit the "10 magical ways" to determine what specific type of content will populate each section (e.g., steps for an experiment, stats and examples for a differentiator, reasons why for a concept) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>. This front-loads all major decisions before any full paragraphs are written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.

## [[AI Workflow Integration Strategies | Integrating AI and Education]]

The back-and-forth conversational process with AI helps create "Lego blocks" that can be assembled into a "mega prompt" for future use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. This allows users to compress entire conversations into single, highly effective prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

Paying for education, such as writing programs like Ship 30 for 30, is powerful because it provides readily available frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>. In the age of AI, learning these frameworks allows users to download them into their own knowledge base and then articulate them to technology, vastly increasing productivity, efficiency, and quality of output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>. For example, internalizing "six proven single sentence openers" in minutes can be leveraged with AI for a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>. The goal is to become an expert by educating oneself and then using AI to take that expertise to the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>. This approach highlights how AI can significantly [[Enhancing writer productivity with AI | enhance writer productivity]].

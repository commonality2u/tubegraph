There is a significant opportunity in the market for non-traditional, non-agency companies or solopreneurs who assist small businesses with running [[aipowered_advertising_and_content_creation | Facebook Ads]] and Google Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Many startups and small businesses struggle with setting up even simple Google Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, making a basic package of Meta Ads and Google Search Ads a potential "game changer" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Why the Opportunity Exists
The current market for paid ad services often presents two less-than-ideal options for small businesses:
1.  **Agencies** These are typically too expensive, too large, and confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
2.  **"Douchy Guys"** Many individual consultants are perceived as intimidating, often portraying a "get rich" lifestyle that can be a turn-off, especially in places like Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

Many small business owners are confused about why ads don't work for them, often falling into the "doucha-verse" where they don't feel a sense of safety and trust with providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. This creates a large demand for trustworthy, one-person ad consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

## Target Verticals and Business Model
Consultants can appeal to specific verticals without needing to be a large agency or project an image of extreme wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. Examples of niches include:
*   Hair salons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>
*   Female product owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>
*   Creative Patreon accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>
*   Yoga retreats, wellness, and design-related events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>
*   Art installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>

A highly effective business model is to charge a percentage of the revenue or ticket sales generated directly from the ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>. This makes the consultant a partner in success rather than just a service provider.

## Launching the Business: A Practical Approach
To get started quickly, one could identify events (e.g., yoga retreats) that are not yet full in a specific city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. Approach the organizers and offer to fill their events using Facebook Ads, taking a cut of every ticket sale generated through those ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>. This works well because event owners often prefer putting on events rather than selling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>. Focusing on topics of personal interest (e.g., creative, wellness, design) can also make ad creation easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.

## Addressing Misconceptions About Paid Ads
Many believe Meta Ads are "dead," but this is largely true only for audiences under 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. For individuals over 40, Meta Ads can perform exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. The perception that not running paid ads is a "status symbol" often comes from "Ventureland" or Silicon Valley's focus on "cutting edge" methods, which doesn't apply to most small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>. For solopreneurs and small teams, ads are an incredibly useful way to acquire clients without needing massive branding campaigns or significant funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>.

## The Role of Funnels and Conversion Rate Optimization
While it's ideal to [[creating_and_testing_product_demand_through_online_ads | test messaging organically]] before running ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>, learning to run ads is a valuable discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:00">[25:04:00]</a>. It allows businesses to invest money to find customers, then focus on converting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:22:00">[25:22:00]</a>.

A successful ad consulting approach involves advising on **funnel building** and [[monetizing_online_directories_through_ads_and_affiliate_marketing | lead generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. A funnel is a step-by-step process designed to convert a stranger into a customer, unlike a website which acts as a business card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:46:00">[49:46:00]</a>.

### Example: A Video Sales Letter (VSL) Funnel
One highly successful funnel type is the Video Sales Letter (VSL) funnel, which can involve multiple steps:
1.  **Opt-in Page** This page offers something of value (e.g., a free training video, a downloadable PDF lead magnet) in exchange for an email address. The goal is to "sell" the idea of watching the video or getting the lead magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:41:00">[29:41:00]</a>. Tools like ClickFunnels or Framer can be used for building these pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:00">[32:07:00]</a>.
2.  **Training Video** The user watches the free training video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:43:00">[32:43:00]</a>.
3.  **Call Booking** At the end of the video, instead of directly selling a product, offer a free call with a coach or sales team to discuss more comprehensive training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:00]</a>. This is where monetization begins.

### Revenue and ROI Example
For one specific funnel, a company spent $86,000 on Facebook and Google Ads in a month, collecting $252,000 in revenue, resulting in a 38% return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>. This funnel generated 339 call bookings, with 273 attendees, and sold 65 units of their main program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>.

### Email Marketing
Collected leads are then nurtured through email marketing campaigns, often leading to seasonal sales like Black Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:07:00">[38:07:00]</a>. While this can lead to unsubscribes, the goal is to maximize sales with the fewest unsubscribes, understanding that some people may prefer to consume free content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:48:00">[39:48:00]</a>. Building a "goodwill bucket" of free content (e.g., a YouTube channel) helps build trust and makes prospects more receptive to sales funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>.

### Copywriting for Conversion
Copywriting is a crucial element of successful funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:25:00">[43:25:00]</a>. Two key hacks include:
1.  **Status Increase** Write copy that suggests the product or service will increase the customer's status, making them more valuable or respected by their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:39:00">[44:39:39]</a>.
2.  **Pain vs. Pleasure**
    *   **Moving Away from Pain** Focus on solving a problem or avoiding a negative situation (e.g., "never get stuck without your podcast equipment again") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:15:00">[46:15:00]</a>. This is often effective during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:01:00">[47:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Moving Towards Pleasure** Highlight the positive benefits and desirable outcomes (e.g., "beautiful sound quality") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:00">[46:51:00]</a>. This works well in prosperous times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:24:00">[47:24:00]</a>.

Traditional dating apps often focus on superficial aspects, primarily looks, leading to a "swiping" culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. However, there's a growing sentiment that the future of dating lies in utilizing [[ai_in_the_dating_industry_and_its_financial_impact | AI in the dating industry]] to move beyond appearance-based matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

## Limitations of Current Dating Apps
Despite allowing users to add personal information like hobbies or favorite activities, current dating apps largely base matches on physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. This approach often fails to capture crucial compatibility factors such as humor and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

## AI-Driven Solutions for Compatibility
The advancements in AI make it easier than ever to create mechanisms for determining compatibility based on a broader range of traits, moving beyond mere swiping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

### Humor-Based Matching
One idea for an AI-driven dating app proposed by someone in Bali involved users swiping on memes instead of faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This system would gauge a user's sense of humor and then match them with compatible individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. Users would still retain agency to decide if they are attracted to the person and wish to chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.

### Eliminating the Swipe
Many singles are growing weary of the constant swiping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. An alternative approach would be to remove the swiping mechanism altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. After an initial onboarding, perhaps involving meme preferences, the app could directly assign users for a blind date at a set time and location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This system could leverage AI to provide conversation prompts, noting shared interests like movies or running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

## Integrating Personal Data for Enhanced Matching
The power of AI allows for deeper integration of personal data to identify compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. Users could choose to connect their apps with platforms such as:
*   Goodreads (for reading preferences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>
*   Netflix (for entertainment tastes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>
*   Strava (for fitness activities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>

In a future where everyone has an "open page" (a personalized digital representation of their life and data), this could serve as a perfect mechanism for initial compatibility identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

## The Future: AI Matchmakers
The evolution of dating apps points towards a future with no swiping, where a personalized AI acts as a matchmaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. This could resemble AI-arranged meetings, with the AI setting up the time and location for dates, removing much of the logistical effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. Users would still have the autonomy to choose whether to continue a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.

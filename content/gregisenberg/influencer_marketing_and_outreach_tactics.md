David Park, founder of Jenny AI, achieved significant growth from zero to $10 million ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) in a few years, largely through a comprehensive growth playbook that includes [[influencer_marketing_strategies | influencer marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This playbook, initially shared in a viral post titled "How to go from Zero to $5 million ARR profitably step by step," emphasizes organic short-form content, [[influencer_marketing_strategies | influencer marketing]], SEO, and paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:01">[01:23:01]</a>.

## The Power of Short-Form Content & "Fresh Accounts"

David Park's strategy leverages the current social media landscape where traditional "clout" like millions of followers or checkmarks is less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Fresh Account Advantage
A fresh account, even with one or ten followers, can go viral immediately if the content is good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. David has seen cases where a fresh account with 56 followers outperformed their main account with 70,000 followers in engagement and views, posting the same content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This is because the algorithm pushes content that resonates with people to millions of users, regardless of follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

For AI startups, where the product can be "a spectacle," it's easier to create visually pleasant content that can go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Sponsoring New vs. Established Accounts
It can be more beneficial to sponsor a fresh account that is gaining traction rather than an established YouTuber with millions of subscribers but similar current view counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Algorithm Boost**: A fresh account with similar views is likely being "juiced by the algorithm" and is on an uptrend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness**: Fresh accounts can be paid significantly less (e.g., 1/100th of the price) than established YouTubers who expect large fees (e.g., $20,000 for a 30-second video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. It's difficult to get ROI from expensive deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Win-Win**: New creators get paid for doing something they enjoy, and startups gain exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Creating Your Own Accounts
Instead of only finding and sponsoring new accounts, businesses can create these accounts themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This involves finding a creator to be the "face" of the product on a completely new, fresh account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This approach avoids "polluting" the creator's main account with ads and offers a middle ground for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Case Study: Mang Mang Duck & Jenny AI
David Park hired Mang Mang Duck, who had 300,000 followers on Tik Tok, to be the face of Jenny AI's account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Compensation**: Mang Mang Duck was paid $4,000 a month for 20 videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   **Relevance**: Their content, focused on teaching people how to write emails or speak precisely, aligned well with Jenny AI's writing tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Results**: The account started from scratch, grew to 70,000 followers, and garnered half a billion views altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. In the first month alone, they achieved 7 million impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **ROI**: A video with one million views can add thousands in monthly recurring revenue (MRR), depending on conversion rates, target countries, and ad directness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Getting 7 million views for $4,000 offers a strong ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Commitment**: The initial commitment was short, around three months, which allowed for testing the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Creators often prefer consistent monthly revenue over one-off, larger brand deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Content Creation**: Creators can be told that videos only take 5-10 minutes a day, focusing on new hooks while providing them with screen grabs and product videos for easy editing and posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Old successful hooks can also be reused with slight variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## The Order of Virality & Content Strategy
The goal when working with a creator is to find a viral series, as a video that goes viral once will likely go viral again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

*   **Human Nature**: People are creatures of habit and tend to rewatch similar content, even if it's slightly varied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Success**: Once a viral video is found, the key is to "squeeze as much upside as you can" by replicating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. Examples include "how many sticks of spaghetti can hold my weight?" series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a> or "for every follower I have, I'll do X" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
*   **Jenny AI Example**: Their "POV you have a paper or an essay due" series involved a relatable plot of someone realizing an essay is due, followed by how Jenny AI helps write it faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This series generated over 300 million views and half a million dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

### Format-Product Fit
It's crucial to have "format product fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Going viral for its own sake is "empty calories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. The content must align with the product to drive conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. A video with 20 million views had negligible conversion effect because it lacked product fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

### Virality Playbook
1.  **Multiple Accounts**: Farm multiple accounts on each platform (Reels, TikTok, Shorts) instead of just one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
2.  **Experimentation**: Experiment with many hooks, video ideas, and different creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. This includes exploring different content angles (skits, memes, humor, educational, straight ads), hooks, and on-screen text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
3.  **Daily Posting**: Post at least one video per day to allow for rapid iteration and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. This increases "shots on goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.
4.  **Find the Viral Series**: Once a video goes viral, turn it into a repeatable series by tweaking it slightly to keep posting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
5.  **Scale Across Accounts**: Tweak and post the viral series on multiple accounts; Jenny AI had 24 accounts posting daily at its peak, multiplying the surface area of luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
6.  **Translate Content**: Translate and create the same video series with creators who speak other languages (e.g., Chinese, Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
7.  **Sponsor Reposts**: At the tail end of a content cycle, pay meme pages or other large accounts on Instagram to repost the viral videos for a second life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
8.  **Paid Ads**: Use mega-viral content for paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
9.  **Cycle End**: The cycle ends when copycats make the series played out, requiring a return to step one to find new hooks and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

## Finding Influencers
Finding [[digital_influencers_as_a_business_asset | influencers]] can feel like a "black box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. The non-sexy answer is to find the influencers that your users actually watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.

### User Research
*   **Ask Users Directly**: Ask users who they follow related to your product's niche (e.g., education, productivity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.
*   **Check Their Following**: Users don't lie about who they follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. Look at the people they interact with and go to for advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
*   **"Suggest Similar Accounts"**: Once you have a list, click on their profiles and use the "suggest similar accounts" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. Review suggested accounts to see if their content and messaging align with your niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.

### Algorithm Hack
*   **Dedicated Account**: Create a new Instagram or Tik Tok account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.
*   **Manual Following**: Manually follow the influencers identified from user research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. Do not follow anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.
*   **Watch Full Videos**: Watch their videos all the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>.
*   **Algorithm-Driven Discovery**: The algorithm will then automatically show you other similar influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. This acts like a free agency, finding new talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.
*   **Spotting Talent**: You'll occasionally find creators with very few followers (e.g., 10 followers) but amazing content, indicating future virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. Sponsoring these early can lead to "craziest deals" and mutually beneficial relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.
*   **For You Page Indicator**: If an [[influencer_marketing_on_tik_tok | influencer's]] video appears on your "For You Page" when you're not following them, it means the platform is already testing their content with larger audiences, indicating potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.

## Outreach Playbook
When reaching out to [[valuable_outreach_strategies_for_gaining_business_partners | influencers]]:
*   **Multi-Channel Attack**: Use all available avenues: DMs, emails, LinkedIn, blogs, or even Venmo (sending a small amount like $50 to get a push notification) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. The harder it is to find their contact, the more impressed they might be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>.
*   **Detailed & Tailored, yet Concise**: Messages should be detailed and personalized, showing you are a fan of their content and why their audience would love your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. Avoid irrelevant details like funding rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>. Keep it concise; no one reads long paragraphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>.
*   **Indicate Paid Promotion**: Clearly state that it is a paid promotion from the start, as influencers are often bombarded with offers for free products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **Expect Low Response Rates**: Assume a majority will not respond, especially early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. Develop "tougher skin" and focus on optimizing your outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.
*   **Momentum Builds**: As your product gains recognition and your own accounts grow (e.g., 70,000 followers and a blue checkmark), it becomes easier to get responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.

## Negotiating with Influencers
The goal is to align incentives between the business and the [[tips_for_negotiating_and_working_with_influencers | influencer]], ensuring both want a video that converts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
*   **Avoid Upfront Payment**: Do not pay all the money upfront to avoid losing leverage. Some influencers might not post or create low-quality content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.
*   **Performance-Based Pay**: Structure payments so a percentage is based on conversions (using a personal coupon code) or views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: Be straightforward about typical conversion rates, budget, and break-even points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. Ask influencers to be transparent about their demographics and past sponsored video performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.
*   **Negotiate Down from Top Price**:
    1.  Ask for the most expensive package first (e.g., Lincoln bio, Instagram story, all short-form accounts, full usage rights, product-focused video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
    2.  Then, remove features that are not essential or are too expensive (e.g., usage rights, link in bio, story post, specific platforms) to arrive at a "true price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
    3.  Finally, suggest a bulk deal (e.g., three videos per month) with a discount (e.g., 20% off) for consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **Ignore Follower-Based Pricing**: Do not rely on common online articles that price sponsorships based solely on follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. This misinformation can lead to overpaying and poor ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

## Content Posting Strategies
*   **Tailored Content**: Avoid a one-size-fits-all approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Sponsored content should not deviate too far from the influencer's usual style, or retention and conversion will suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
*   **Trust the Influencer**: If inexperienced, trust the influencer to create content similar to their existing posts, just integrating your product at a specific timestamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.
*   **Leverage Existing Series**: Integrate your product into an influencer's existing popular series (e.g., "Top 10 AI Tools that feel illegal to know") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>.
*   **Scale and Autopilot**: To scale [[influencer_marketing_as_a_service | influencer marketing]], you eventually need to trust influencers to create content based on a blueprint (how the product should be spoken about, portrayed, expected views/engagement) without constant micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. The goal is to have enough people "on autopilot" with package deals to allow for continuous posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>. Jenny AI manages 50-100k USD per month in influencer marketing with only two people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>.
*   **Direct Ads**: Don't be afraid if a video looks like a "straight-up ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. While it might get fewer views, it will convert better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Subtle ads are easily ignored; direct ads, addressing a pain point, resonate more with those who have that specific need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>.

## Key Takeaways
*   **Balance Art & Science**: Influencer marketing requires both creative and managerial skills. You need to foster human relationships with creators while also tracking data to identify winning/losing influencers and refine your model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.
*   **Leverage Any Advantage**: Use any common ground or connection you have with a creator (e.g., mutual fraternity, growing up in the same neighborhood) to build rapport and increase response rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>.

## Evolution of Growth (Beyond 5M ARR)
Beyond the initial growth to $5 million ARR, the fundamental [[influencer_marketing_strategies | influencer marketing]] and content strategies continued to be effective for reaching $10 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.
*   **Scaling Operations**: The focus shifted to improving hiring and building out teams to manage the scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Marketing**: A significant portion of revenue began to come from affiliate marketers who championed Jenny AI and received a cut of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   **Acquisitions**: Jenny AI also began acquiring other startups, integrating their learnings to double the acquired companies' revenue without significant additional marketing spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.
*   **Back to Basics: Retention & Conversion**: A primary focus for scaling from $5 million to $10 million ARR was improving retention and conversion rates within the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>. Jenny AI reduced its churn from 20% to 9.8%, which significantly eases growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>.

The rise of AI-powered applications has opened new avenues for entrepreneurs, demonstrating that significant revenue can be generated through strategic marketing and focused product development, even when leveraging existing AI models like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

## Case Study: The Riz App and AI Rizz Apps

One prominent example of a successful [[using_ai_for_app_development | AI-based app]] is Riz, an AI dating coach built on ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:02">[02:04:02]</a>. This app achieved approximately $190,000 in monthly revenue and 333,000 downloads per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. The founder reportedly got the initial idea from a Tinder subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

### Marketing Focus for AI Wrappers

For "ChatGPT wrappers" – apps that leverage a core AI model like ChatGPT – the product's unique features are less critical than its [[ai_app_marketing_strategies | marketing and branding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. Key elements for success include:
*   **Strong Branding and Naming:** A memorable name, such as "Riz" (a term popular among young people for charm or attractiveness), is crucial for virality and word-of-mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   **Effective Referral Flows:** Incorporating features that encourage users to invite friends can significantly boost growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **Niche Positioning:** Instead of trying to be a general-purpose app, these successful apps focus on specific verticals, such as dating coaching, style advice, or life advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. This clear positioning simplifies [[leveraging_ai_for_marketing_strategies | marketing efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:14">[0:10:14]</a>.

### Diversified AI App Portfolio

The founder of the app initially thought to be Riz (which was actually Plug AI) operates a small development studio called AI RZ and has launched three apps, collectively generating around $500,000 in monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. This strategy minimizes risk by not relying on a single application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.

The apps include:
*   **Plug AI:** A texting assistant that uses AI to suggest pickup lines based on user screenshots, marketed as the "ultimate AI RZ" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
*   **Astra:** An AI for life advice, offering guidance on challenges, relationships, personal growth, and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:05]</a>.
*   **Pallet:** An AI-powered app that determines a user's color season from a selfie and generates personalized style and makeup suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

This approach demonstrates the power of AI to provide "coaching in three different verticals" without building extensive new technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. It falls under the umbrella of [[applications_of_ai_in_marketing_and_growth_strategies | leveraging AI for marketing strategies]] by focusing on specific user needs.

## Business Strategy and Sustainability

While AI-based apps can be seen as "flash in the pan" opportunities due to reliance on underlying platforms like OpenAI, they offer substantial benefits:
*   **Financial Gain:** Earning significant monthly revenue, even if temporary, allows founders to achieve financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Skill Development:** The process of launching and scaling these apps provides invaluable business and [[role_of_ai_in_marketing_and_business_growth | marketing skills]] that are transferable to future ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:55:00">[23:55:00]</a>.
*   **"First Nut" Philosophy:** Achieving substantial early capital can enable entrepreneurs to "change their world before they change the world," providing a foundation for future, potentially more impactful, projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

## Anti-Trend Opportunities

While many are focused on developing new [[viral_ai_app_development_and_business_strategies | AI apps]], an "anti-trend" strategy can also be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. This involves identifying areas where human-led services can compete with, or even complement, AI offerings, often at a premium price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>.

For example, an AI dating coach could offer a premium upgrade where human experts provide more personalized advice. Similarly, a human-led "pallet" service could offer a more tailored and interactive experience than its AI counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>. The advantage of anti-trends is often reduced competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

## Identifying New Opportunities

Given the high competition in obvious [[use_of_ai_agents_in_marketing_strategies | AI assistant applications]] (like dating or therapy), new developers should seek "non-obvious use cases" for ChatGPT wrappers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>. Combining this with an understanding of anti-trends can reveal unique market opportunities.

Deep research in the context of [[AI tools for building software | AI tools for building software]] refers to the ability of AI models to act like a junior analyst, providing in-depth information and strategic insights into a given question or problem, similar to what a consultant might offer for hundreds of thousands of dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This capability can be leveraged to generate, validate, and strategize for new business ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Comparing AI Deep Research Tools
A comparison was conducted between OpenAI's ChatGPT Pro (Deep Research) and Perplexity AI (Deep Research) to evaluate their effectiveness in generating [[AI startup ideas]] and developing detailed business plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

*   **OpenAI ChatGPT Pro (Deep Research)**: Costs $200 per month for the Pro Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. It tends to be slower in generating responses but provides more in-depth and comprehensive reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. It often asks clarifying questions to tailor its initial responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Perplexity AI (Deep Research)**: Costs $20 per month for the Pro Plan, though a limited free tier is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. It is notably faster than ChatGPT in providing answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. It directly provides results without initial qualification questions, requiring more specific prompting from the user upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

Both tools conduct extensive searches, with Perplexity AI observed to pull from dozens of sources (e.g., 29 to 34 sources) to generate its insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Prompting Strategy
The same detailed prompt was given to both [[AI tools for app development | AI tools for app development]] to test their deep research capabilities for entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>:
"I want to create a startup. I want it to be an AI agent that focuses on a high-value niche. I want it to be defensible, not just a flash in the pan. I want you to create a zero-to-one Playbook of how you'd launch it to get customers. Give me five ideas with five playbooks on how to grow it. I'm looking for $1 million ARR year one, $3 million year two, and $5 million year three." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Additional constraints and preferences were provided:
*   **Industry**: Open to the highest likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Target Market**: Open to B2B or B2C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **AI Capabilities**: No specific preference, focused on highest probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Technical Resources**: Prefer an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) cost of $5,000 or less, with a non-technical founder in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Funding**: Open to cash flow or potentially raising VC money for businesses with over $100 million ARR potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Go-to-Market**: Lean towards viral self-serve growth, but open to suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Startup Ideas and Playbooks

### Perplexity AI Idea: Legal Contract Lifecycle AI Agent
Perplexity AI proposed an [[AI startup ideas and incubation | AI startup idea]] focused on legal contract lifecycle management.

*   **Problem**: Corporate legal teams spend 23% of their time on manual contract review, leading to version control errors and annual costs of $2.4 billion in penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Existing solutions are often inflexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Defensible Solution**: An AI agent that integrates with email, SharePoint, and DocuSign, learns organizational risk thresholds, auto-redlines third-party documents, and maintains version lineage with blockchain-style audit trails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Defensibility**: Develops institutional memory through continuous learning, embeds in workflows, and requires significant retraining if replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Growth Playbook**:
    *   **Phase 1 (Niche Validation - 90 days)**: Build a Chrome extension to record legal contract review sessions (with permission) to train the initial model. Offer free redline audits for 100 AmLaw 200 firms. Monetization at $2,500/month for specific document types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
    *   **Phase 2 (Workflow Embedding - Months 4-9)**: Integrate with legal operations platforms (e.g., Lexion), launch a Clause Library Builder, and implement usage-based pricing ($0.25 per review clause) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
    *   **Phase 3 (Enterprise Scaling - Months 10-12)**: Add SOC 2 Type 2 compliance, develop custom connectors (e.g., for ServiceNow, Salesforce cpq), and upsell to an $8,000/month enterprise tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Financial Roadmap (ARR)**:
    *   Year 1: $1.2 million (40 clients at $25,000 MRR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
    *   Year 2: $3.1 million (150 clients at $5,000 MRR plus $250k usage pay) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
    *   Year 3: $5.4 million (platform fees from 300+ embedded instances) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

In a follow-up query, Perplexity AI addressed competition in the AI legal space (e.g., Harvey, CaseText) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. It provided an executive summary, competitive analysis, and an opportunity matrix to identify underserved niches. It then detailed an MVP implementation plan with a budget of $4,800, including a Chrome extension prototype and phase two core feature builds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. The go-to-market strategy included free clause vulnerability audits and pricing at $0.15 per clause auto-redline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

### ChatGPT Pro Idea: AI Sales Outreach Assistant
ChatGPT Pro suggested an [[AI tools for building software | AI-powered sales outreach assistant]] acting as a virtual Sales Development Representative (SDR).

*   **Problem**: B2B companies need more sales pipeline without hiring additional SDRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
*   **Solution**: An AI agent that automates prospect research and personalized cold emails/LinkedIn messages, enriching lead data and crafting tailored outreach at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   **Defensibility**: Achieved through a data network effect, where the AI learns from every interaction, identifying effective messaging and building a unique data set for each industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Integration into CRMs and email systems further deepens the moat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **MVP Build (under $5,000 budget)**:
    *   **Narrow Focus**: Start with automating follow-up emails to warm leads using AI-personalized templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
    *   **Low Cost**: Use existing AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4) for text generation, create a simple UI with low-code tools, focus initially on email only, and implement a manual fallback for AI uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
    *   A freelance developer could build this MVP in a few weeks, with main costs being developer time and API calls, remaining under the $5,000 budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
*   **Customer Acquisition and Growth**:
    *   **Product-Led Viral Adoption**: Offer a limited free tier (e.g., 50 AI-generated emails/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
    *   **Viral Loop**: Prompt users to share success internally when the AI books a meeting or gets a reply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.
    *   **Referral Incentives and Content Marketing**: Publish case studies and short demos, and list on CRM marketplaces (e.g., HubSpot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
*   **Financial Roadmap**:
    *   Year 1: $1 million ARR (200 companies converting to paid clients at $5,000/year average) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.
    *   Year 2: Growth to $3 million ARR through land-and-expand strategies, free user conversion, and small team upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Per-seat pricing (e.g., $49/month for solo, $199/month for teams) or usage-based tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.
*   **VC Readiness**: The idea has the potential to scale to $100 million ARR, which would likely necessitate VC funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.

In a follow-up, ChatGPT Pro suggested a new, less obvious idea: an [[Applications of AI in business and startups | AI platform for longtail podcasts and sponsors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. This platform would streamline podcast production and bundle small podcasts for advertisers, leveraging proprietary data on content resonance and ad placement effectiveness to create a continuous learning loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. Its MVP development would focus on time-consuming content creation by implementing an AI transcript and summary generator for podcast episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.

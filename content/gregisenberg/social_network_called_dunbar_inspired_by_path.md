This idea proposes the creation of a minimalist, private social network, envisioned as a modern reinvention of the historical app, Path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:39:00">[25:39:00]</a>. It aims to address the desire for a closed-off network among close friends and family, contrasting with the public nature of many current social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:37:00">[28:37:00]</a>.

## Core Concept: Dunbar's Number

The proposed name, "Dunbar," is inspired by Dunbar's Number, a sociology theory suggesting human beings can only maintain about 150 meaningful connections at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>. This theory directly informs the network's proposed limit of up to 150 close friends, mirroring Path's original approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>. The app's name itself would carry this story, making the limit part of its identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>.

## Features and User Experience

The network would focus on simple, impactful interactions:
*   **Location Updates** Users could push a button to automatically update their location, showing friends their general city or region rather than exact GPS coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:47:00">[27:47:00]</a>. This feature would facilitate spontaneous meetups among friends traveling in the same city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>.
*   **Proximity-Based Feed** The feed would prioritize friends based on their proximity, making it easy to see who is nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>.
*   **Conversation Starter** Unlike platforms where users primarily lurk, Dunbar would aim to spark conversations and encourage user contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:00">[28:08:00]</a>.
*   **Minimalist Design** The app would be incredibly simple, doing one thing really well, similar to Path's original design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:00]</a>. A modern version would be "shinier, glossier, [and] more beautiful" for today's standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17:00">[29:17:00]</a>.

## Market Need and Inspiration

The demand for such a network is evident in current user behavior:
*   **Instagram Status Updates** A significant portion of Instagram's status updates are used by people to share their current city, indicating a clear desire among friends to know each other's whereabouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>.
*   **Apple's Find My Friends** Many close friends use Apple's "Find My Friends" app for similar purposes, though it lacks the depth of a social network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>.
*   **Nostalgia for Path** Many who experienced Path miss its private, intimate approach to social sharing, indicating a lasting desire for such a platform in the modern era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:00">[26:45:00]</a>.

## Monetization Strategy

Unlike ad-supported models, Dunbar could utilize a subscription model:
*   **Annual Subscription** Users could pay an annual fee, potentially $20-$30 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:49:00">[31:49:00]</a>.
*   **Sticker Packs** Drawing inspiration from Path, which monetized by selling sticker packs for $2-$5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>.

## Development and Challenges

[[Building a social media app with AI | Building a consumer social network]] is considered "hard mode" in the startup world due to the difficulty in achieving network effects and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:58:00">[26:58:00]</a>.

However, modern tools and strategies can mitigate some risks:
*   **AI-Assisted Development** The use of AI tools like Claude AI and ChatGPT APIs can accelerate product creation, reducing the need for large investments and teams for beta testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.
*   **Bootstrapping** This type of business could potentially be bootstrapped, meaning it could be built and grown without external investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>.
*   **PR and Marketing** A strong PR strategy focusing on the "anti-social media" narrative could attract media attention, as many companies are keen to write about alternatives to traditional social networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:00">[26:16:00]</a>.

A primary challenge lies in establishing network effects; if users' close friends are not on the app, its utility is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:20:00">[27:20:00]</a>. However, the inherent human need for intimate connection and sharing within a trusted circle remains constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>.

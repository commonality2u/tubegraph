Computer vision, once considered a distant technology, is now seen as accessible and capable of being implemented cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. Traditionally, applications of computer vision in enterprise settings, such as installing sensors in buildings or supermarkets, required significant investment, often hundreds of thousands of dollars, making it inaccessible to the average person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.

## Current and Potential Use Cases

### Retail and Small Business Analytics
For small business owners, like a deli proprietor, computer vision offers the ability to gain detailed insights into customer behavior using simple devices like webcams or old iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

Potential applications include:
*   **Heat maps**: Identifying where customers congregate, make purchases, linger, or bypass certain areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.
*   **Anonymized facial recognition**: Determining the number of repeat customers, their peak visiting times, and when new customers typically arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.
*   **Navigation analysis**: Observing where customers become confused or walk back and forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>.

The goal is to make this technology accessible via a simple app installation on a smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

### Personalized Customer Experience
Imagine walking into a store where the staff instantly knows your preferences, like your favorite music artist, and queues up a song for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. Similarly, a deli owner could use facial recognition to prompt staff about a returning customer's favorite order, like salami, creating a personalized and welcoming experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.

### Social Interaction and Networking
A compelling demonstration involved Ray-Ban sunglasses equipped with a hidden camera that used facial recognition to identify people and whisper their name and profession to the wearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. This allowed the wearer to initiate conversations with strangers, appearing to know them, and facilitating interactions with interesting individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

### Public Safety and Security
At WeWork, an [[Applications of AI in video and image generation | AI]]/ML team explored using existing building cameras for safety applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.
Potential uses included:
*   Detecting smoke that could lead to fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.
*   Identifying individuals carrying weapons like guns or knives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.
This technology is already being explored in contexts like high schools to replace security guards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

## Concerns and Outlook

While the applications are exciting, there are significant ethical considerations, particularly regarding privacy. The idea of being tracked by facial recognition in physical spaces, even if anonymized, raises concerns about the "Panopticon" effect and whether it will be comfortable for current generations, though future generations might not "think twice" about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

[!WARNING|Privacy Concerns]
The use of computer vision in physical spaces, such as delis, for facial tracking, even if anonymized, could lead to public backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. While digital tracking is somewhat accepted, its extension into the physical world "takes it to the next level" of discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

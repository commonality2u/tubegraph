David Park, founder of Jenny AI, grew his AI startup from zero to $10 million ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) in a few years, utilizing an "incredible growth tactic Playbook" [00:00:06]. This playbook, which he shares, is considered comprehensive for growth marketing, especially for AI startups [00:00:21].

## Organic Short-Form Content

David Park's strategy highlights the power of organic short-form content, particularly on platforms like TikTok [00:01:23].

### The "Fresh Account" Advantage
On modern social media, the history of a channel or its follower count (e.g., millions of followers or checkmarks) is no longer as significant as it once was [00:03:06]. Founders can make a single video on TikTok that immediately goes viral, regardless of their follower count [00:03:22]. This means a "fresh account" with 1 or 10 followers has a similar chance of virality as an account with a million followers [00:04:00]. A/B tests at Jenny AI showed that content posted on an account with 50 followers sometimes outperformed the same content on an account with 70,000 followers in terms of engagement and views [00:04:06].

David Park states he would "unironically sponsor a fresh account made this week versus a YouTuber with a million Subs if they had similar views" [00:05:05]. This is because a fresh account getting similar views is likely "Juiced by the algorithm right now" and is on an uptrend [00:05:33]. Additionally, fresh accounts are significantly cheaper to sponsor, often costing "one 100th of the price" compared to established YouTubers who expect large fees (e.g., $20,000 for a 30-second video) [00:06:07]. This creates a win-win scenario: the new creator gets paid for content they might have done for free, and the company gets content seen by potentially millions of people at a lower cost [00:06:40].

### Becoming the "Face of Your Product"
Instead of sponsoring new accounts, companies can create these accounts themselves by having a creator become the "face of your product" [00:08:15]. This creator educates viewers on pain points solved by the product or offers helpful advice [00:09:15]. This approach avoids polluting the creator's main account with ads while still leveraging their ability to produce engaging content [00:10:10].

For Jenny AI, David Park partnered with Ming duck, who had 300,000 followers on TikTok [00:11:29]. Ming duck was paid $4,000 per month for 20 videos [00:11:37]. The new account started from zero followers and grew to 70,000 followers, generating half a billion views across platforms [00:12:08]. In the first month, they achieved 7 million impressions [00:12:25]. A video with one million views can add thousands in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) to a product, depending on conversion rates, target countries, and the directness of the promotion [00:12:32].

The agreement with Ming duck was initially for three months [00:15:06], providing consistent revenue for the creator rather than a one-off deal [00:16:05]. Creators can produce 20 videos a month with minimal daily effort (5-10 minutes) by brainstorming new hooks and using pre-supplied screen grabs and product videos [00:17:01]. Old successful hooks can even be reused [00:17:31].

### Importance of Daily Posting and Viral Series
Initially, it's crucial to post "one plus videos per day" on all platforms (Reels, TikTok, Shorts) [00:17:58]. This high frequency allows for rapid experimentation with different hooks, content angles (skits, memes, educational content, ads), text on screen, and other variables [00:18:41]. This "explore before you exploit" approach increases the chances of finding a "Mega Banger" video that gets millions of views [00:19:10].

The ultimate goal when working with a creator is to find a "viral series" [00:20:18]. Humans are creatures of habit and often want to see familiar content repeatedly [00:20:47]. Once a viral video is found, the next step is to "squeeze as much of the upside as you can out of that viral video" by turning it into a series [00:21:16]. Examples include:
*   A guy testing how many spaghetti sticks can hold his weight, then repeating it with coat hangers, paper, and broken iPads [00:21:33].
*   A creator doing "X" for every follower, e.g., gambling $1 for every follower [00:22:16].
*   A creator drinking a cup of milk for every thousand followers [00:22:34].

Jenny AI's successful viral series was "point of view you have a paper or an essay due" [00:22:50]. These videos depicted relatable scenarios of realizing an essay is due, always ending with the product (Jenny AI) helping write the paper faster [00:23:00]. This specific series generated over 300 million views overall and approximately half a million dollars in revenue for Jenny AI [00:29:01].

### Format-Product Fit
It's crucial to have "format product fit" [00:24:14]. Going viral for the sake of it ("empty calories") is unproductive if the content doesn't align with the product [00:24:48]. A video with 20 million views that doesn't convert is less valuable than a video with 50,000 views that brings in hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue [00:25:10]. Content must be created for people who actually want to convert and use the product [00:25:39].

### Order of Virality (Life Cycle)
1.  **Farming Multiple Accounts**: Instead of one account per platform, create multiple accounts (e.g., seven accounts on each short-form platform, totaling 24 accounts) to post videos daily [00:26:01]. This increases the "surface area of luck" for content to go viral [00:27:07].
2.  **Experimentation**: Continuously experiment with hooks and video ideas, observing what competitors are doing and what's trending in other industries [00:26:05].
3.  **Viral Series**: Once a video goes viral, turn it into a series by tweaking and reposting it [00:26:33].
4.  **Multilingual Expansion**: Translate and create the same video series with creators who speak other languages (e.g., Chinese, Spanish) [00:27:14]. Jenny AI saw very good conversions from Chinese accounts [00:27:29].
5.  **Sponsored Reposts**: As the series naturally declines, sponsor other pages (e.g., Instagram meme pages run by teenagers) to repost the viral videos [00:27:44]. This gives the content a "second life" and reaches new audiences, albeit with lesser virality [00:28:10].
6.  **Paid Ads**: Utilize the most successful viral content for [[strategies_for_effective_content_creation | paid ads]] [00:28:26].
7.  **Iteration**: Eventually, copycats will dilute the effectiveness of the series, and the audience will get bored [00:28:31]. At this point, return to step one to "farm out hooks, farming out ideas, doing your research and then running through life cycle Once More" [00:28:47].

## Influencer Marketing

[[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_app_promotion | Influencer marketing]] involves finding, reaching out to, and negotiating with creators to promote a product.

### Finding Influencers
The most effective way to find relevant influencers is to "find the influencers that your users watch" [00:31:05].
1.  **Talk to Users**: Ask users directly about their Instagram or TikTok handles and which influencers they follow related to your product [00:31:19].
2.  **Look at Following Lists**: Check who these users follow, as their following list reveals their true affinities and sources of advice [00:31:36].
3.  **Suggested Accounts**: On platforms like Instagram, click on an influencer's profile and use the "suggest similar accounts" feature [00:32:40]. Evaluate if their content and messaging fit your niche [00:32:53].
4.  **Algorithm Hacking (New Account Strategy)**: Create a new Instagram or TikTok account and manually follow a list of target influencers [00:33:16]. Watch their videos all the way through [00:33:23]. The platform's algorithm will then "automatically show you like other influencers that are... in the same bucket" [00:33:24]. This allows for discovering new, potentially cheaper, talent with viral potential [00:33:58]. Sponsoring creators whose content appears on your "for you page" when you're not following them indicates their content is being pushed by the platform, increasing your upside [00:34:40].

### Reaching Out to Influencers
When reaching out to influencers, use "all avenues of attack" such as DMs, emails, LinkedIn, or even old blogs [00:36:22]. The difficulty in finding their contact info can impress them, showing you're not shotgunning emails [00:36:44].

Messages should be "very detailed and as tailored as possible but be concise" [00:37:39]. Avoid generic, self-promotional language about funding rounds or employee numbers [00:37:58]. Instead, demonstrate genuine fandom for their content and clearly state that it's a paid promotion [00:39:04], as influencers are constantly bombarded with offers for free products [00:39:07]. Expect a majority of initial messages to go unanswered, especially early on [00:39:29]. As your product gains traction and your own social media accounts grow, it becomes easier to get responses from other creators [00:39:47].

A "hack" is to send small Venmo payments (e.g., $50) with a message, as people receive push notifications and are likely to respond to unexpected money [00:37:42].

### Negotiating with Influencers
The key to negotiation is to "align the incentives between you and the influencers" [00:40:30].
*   **Avoid Upfront Payment**: Do not give all the money upfront, as it removes your leverage and can lead to low-effort or no posts [00:40:41].
*   **Performance-Based Pay**: Split payments so a percentage is based on conversions (using personal coupon codes) or views [00:41:07].
*   **Transparency**: Be transparent about your budget and expected ROI. For example, explain "this is the break even point would you be down to like do this and then we could have this much as bonuses if the video does well" [00:41:44].
*   **Tiered Pricing Negotiation**: Ask for the most expensive package first (e.g., Lincoln bio, Instagram story, all short-form accounts, full usage rights, product-focused video) [00:42:06]. Then, negotiate down by removing elements you don't need (e.g., usage rights, link in bio, stories) until you reach a "true price" for one video [00:42:37]. Finally, propose a bulk deal (e.g., three videos per month at a 20% discount) [00:43:03].
*   **Ignore Follower-Based Pricing**: David Park strongly advises against paying based on follower count, calling it "the most craziest misinformation" [00:43:47]. Companies that do this often overpay and fail to achieve ROI [00:44:12].

### Posting Content
When posting content, a "one size fits-all strategy" won't work [00:44:52].
*   **Tailor to Creator's Style**: Sponsored content must not deviate too far from the influencer's usual style, or retention will be terrible [00:45:01]. If new to this, trust the influencer to make something similar to their regular posts, simply integrating the product halfway through [00:45:17].
*   **Integrate into Existing Series**: If an influencer has an existing viral series (e.g., "top 10 AI tools that feel illegal to know"), ask to be inserted into that series [00:45:48]. This leverages their audience's existing interest, minimizing creative work [00:46:01].
*   **Scaling and Trust**: To scale [[influencer_marketing_as_a_service | influencer marketing]] (e.g., a video every few hours), you must trust influencers and provide them with a clear blueprint (how the product should be spoken about, portrayed, expected views/engagement) [00:46:18]. Setting up package deals allows you to "set and forget" and reduces the need for constant micromanagement [00:46:51]. Jenny AI, for example, has only two people managing its [[influencer_marketing_as_a_service | influencer marketing]] efforts, spending hundreds of thousands per month [00:47:31].
*   **Direct Ads are Okay**: Don't be afraid if your video looks like a straight-up ad [00:47:56]. Even if it gets fewer views, "it will convert better" [00:48:02]. Direct messaging that addresses a pain point ("don't you hate when this happens?", "this will solve your issue") resonates more with potential customers than subtle, aesthetic ads [00:48:42].

### Final Tips for Influencer Marketing
It's a mix of managerial and artistic skills [00:50:34]. You need to facilitate partnerships well, manage many campaigns efficiently, track data to identify winning/losing influencers, and refine your approach [00:50:11]. Simultaneously, you must build real human relationships with artistic creators to break through the noise [00:50:47]. Leverage any advantage you can, such as shared backgrounds, to build rapport with creators [01:09:11].

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

SEO is a "delayed gratification" channel and should generally not be the first focus for early-stage startups [00:52:46]. Other channels like [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_app_promotion | influencer marketing]] or UGC content can generate orders of magnitude more traffic initially [00:53:02]. Jenny AI even acquired an entire SEO agency to make them an in-house team [00:52:05].

### SEO Hacks
*   **Featured Snippets**: Identify pages with featured snippets for specific queries [00:53:15]. By creating the "perfect answer" to that featured snippet, you can "Leap Frog" directly to the top spot [00:53:35].
*   **Increase Brand Name Searches**: People often watch a viral TikTok video and then Google the product name instead of clicking the link in the bio [00:54:26]. Running [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_app_promotion | influencer marketing]] and UGC campaigns naturally increases brand name searches, which Google interprets as legitimacy, passively boosting your SEO without much direct work [00:54:36].
*   **Focus on Valuable Keywords**: Prioritize ranking for keywords that indicate buying intent (e.g., "best tool possible") rather than vanity metrics or keywords associated with free users [00:55:10].
*   **Mini Tools and Multilingual Pages**: Create free mini-tools and landing pages in different languages to attract traffic and improve SEO [00:56:08].

SEO is now a main pillar for Jenny AI, with tens of thousands of dollars spent monthly on it [00:55:58]. However, it's recommended for later stages when there's a "study income stream" and product-market fit [00:56:30].

## Paid Ads

Paid ads are also considered a "trap" for early-stage entrepreneurs due to their slower iteration cycles compared to organic content [00:57:02]. It takes time to learn, create creatives, and get enough data for effective targeting [00:57:25]. Many companies get stuck in a 1:1 or 1.5:1 customer acquisition cost (CAC) to lifetime value (LTV) ratio, often remaining unprofitable [00:57:40].

### Leveraging Organic Success
The advantage of doing UGC and [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_app_promotion | influencer marketing]] first is that you can reuse content that has already resonated organically for paid ads [00:57:57]. Data from social media partnerships provides better targeting insights from day one (e.g., which countries convert better, LTV by country, ideal user types) [00:58:05]. Jenny AI started focusing on paid ads only after establishing some product-market fit [00:58:25].

### Financial Metrics
Jenny AI aims for a 3:1 LTV to CAC ratio [00:58:44] and a short payback period, ideally recouping costs within the first two months of acquiring a user [00:58:52]. This allows reinvestment of money into the best-performing acquisition channels [00:59:06].

## Scaling from $5 Million to $10 Million ARR

The fundamental strategies outlined in the playbook (organic content, [[influencer_marketing_strategies_for_app_promotion | influencer marketing]], SEO, paid ads) remained applicable and were continuously used to scale from $5 million to $10 million ARR [01:02:24].

New elements added include:
*   **Affiliate Marketing**: A significant portion of revenue now comes from affiliate marketers who champion Jenny AI and earn a cut [01:02:52].
*   **Acquisitions**: Jenny AI has acquired other startups, leveraging their existing learnings to double revenue for one acquired startup in five months without significant marketing spend [01:03:08].
*   **Back to Basics (Retention & Conversion)**: As the company grew, a laser focus was placed on improving retention and conversion rates within the sales funnel [01:04:37]. Jenny AI reduced its monthly churn rate from 20% to 9.8% [01:05:12], which is crucial for growth as "churn can literally make your startup so much larger" [01:05:28]. High churn rates (50-30% monthly) are common for B2C AI apps [01:05:46].

Scaling from $5 million to $10 million ARR involved refining the funnel, scaling what was already working, making strategic acquisitions, and adding new channels where appropriate [01:06:23].

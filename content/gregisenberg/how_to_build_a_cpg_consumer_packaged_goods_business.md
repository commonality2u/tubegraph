Building a successful CPG business involves understanding market demand, leveraging data and trends, and implementing strong [[Branding and marketing strategies for products | branding and marketing strategies]]. Ashwin, an expert in launching and growing consumer brands, shares insights on how to approach this complex but rewarding endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

## Identifying Opportunities with Data and Trends

Before building any product, it's crucial to evaluate opportunities and ensure there's demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. This approach can also be applied to software startups, not just physical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

### Ahrefs: Assessing Demand and Competition

Ahrefs is a powerful SEO tool primarily used to understand search volume and keyword difficulty on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **Evaluate Category Demand:** Type in a keyword or term to see its search volume, which indicates market interest. For example, "electrolytes" shows high search volume with seasonal peaks in June and July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.
*   **Assess Keyword Difficulty:** Ahrefs provides a keyword difficulty score (0-100), indicating how hard it is to rank on Google for that term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. An 88/100 score for "electrolytes" signifies intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. High difficulty means a significant investment of time, money, and SEO expertise is required to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
*   **Identify Global Opportunities:** Analyze the geographic distribution of search volume. If a term is popular in English-speaking Western countries but not elsewhere, it might indicate an opportunity to introduce the product to new markets (e.g., an electrolyte brand for Germany or India) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.
*   **Understand Trends:** Look at historical search data to identify rising or declining trends. For instance, CBD's explosive growth in 2019 after the 2018 farm bill, followed by a decline as Delta 9 (legal THC) grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

### Particle: Analyzing Competitors and Best-Selling Products

Particle is a tool specific to the physical product space, allowing users to analyze e-commerce brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.
*   **Track Sales:** See a brand's sales over time from their e-commerce website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.
*   **Identify Best-Selling SKUs:** Understand which products or flavors drive most of a competitor's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. This helps de-risk product decisions, showing what flavors or options are already popular and should be prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>.
*   **Discover Trends:** Particle also has a "Trend Explorer" to see how specific products and categories are trending up or down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.
*   **Beyond Particle:** Platforms like TikTok Shop and Amazon also make sales figures public, providing insights into competitive landscapes and popular products within categories (e.g., magnesium supplements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>.

## Differentiating Your Product

The [[Challenges of consumer products versus B2B | consumer product world is competitive]] and requires significant effort to capture attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>. Differentiation is key.

### Visual Branding and Packaging
Many existing CPG products, especially supplements, often have a generic, medical, or unappealing appearance (e.g., stock white bottles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>.
*   **Stand Out:** Invest in distinctive look and feel. Moon Juice, for example, uses an amber jar to create a unique visual identity for its magnesium glycinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59:00">[22:59:00]</a>.
*   **Customization:** Brands like Lemi have invested in custom bottles, caps, and vibrant colors to create a fun and accessible image, specifically positioning themselves towards women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>.

### Strategic Positioning and Audience
*   **Niche Targeting:** Especially in early stages, focus on a specific niche and tailor your messaging to them. Seed, for example, although marketed for both men and women, primarily targets women through its influencer marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:30:00">[24:30:00]</a>.
*   **Underserved Demographics:** Identify demographics that are not currently targeted by well-branded products. For example, while many modern CPG brands target millennials or Gen Z with "Millennial Blanding" or "bright and vibrant" aesthetics, there's an opportunity to create well-designed products for older adults who have disposable income and are not saturated with advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>.

## Bootstrap Your CPG Idea

It's possible to validate and launch a CPG product without a massive initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:04:00">[29:04:00]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solution Focused Products:** For products like pimple patches (e.g., Mighty Patch), where the design is functional and communicates information clearly, you can often create initial designs using tools like Canva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">[29:11:00]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Brands:** Categories like spirits or high-end beauty, where design is paramount to the lifestyle branding, often require professional design talent from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:49:00">[29:49:00]</a>.
*   **Freelance Talent:** Utilize platforms like Fiverr and Upwork to hire independent freelance designers for packaging or simple landing pages, often for a few hundred dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>.
*   **AI Tools for Design:** AI tools like Midjourney can generate V1 designs for packaging or branding, which can then be refined by a designer (e.g., recreating in vector format or making minor changes) for a much lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>.
*   **Clarify Your Vision:** Before hiring an agency, do the hard work of creating a mood board, defining your desired positioning and copy, and developing a strong point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:07:00">[33:07:00]</a>.

### Research and Point of View

Relentless research is crucial, whether building software or consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:05:00">[34:05:00]</a>.
*   **Category and Competition Analysis:** Read everything about your target category and analyze every competitor. Understand their positioning, visuals, language, and what they communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:24:00">[34:24:00]</a>.
*   **Direct Customer Insights:** Talk to store owners about what's selling or not, and what customers are looking for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:09:00">[35:09:00]</a>. For software, analyze one-star and two-star reviews of competitors, and talk directly to potential users (e.g., dentists for CRM software) to understand their pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:53:00">[35:53:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage AI for Research:** Tools like Manis can act as a research agent, analyzing competitors, researching specific needs (e.g., skincare for older adults), and generating comprehensive reports in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:50:00">[36:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:10:00">[37:10:00]</a>. This offers a significant "unfair advantage" by providing deep market insights that previously cost thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:44:00">[38:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:32:00">[39:32:00]</a>.

## Focus on Distribution First

A critical lesson for founders is to focus on distribution and customer acquisition channels *before* building the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:02:00">[40:02:00]</a>.
*   **First-time founders focus on product; second-time founders focus on distribution.** This adage holds true, as many subpar products succeed due to incredible distribution and operational excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:13:00">[40:13:00]</a>.
*   **Mastering Marketing:** Building a physical product business is challenging, but it forces founders to become excellent at marketing due to the difficulty of acquiring customers for physical goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>. The "bleeding edge of marketing" often happens in the consumer product world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>.

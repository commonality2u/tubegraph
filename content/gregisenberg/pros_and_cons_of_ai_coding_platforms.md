## Categories of AI Coding Tools

AI coding tools can generally be divided into three main cohorts based on technicality and control:

1.  **No-Code Tools** You don't need to be technical to use these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
2.  **Middle Ground Tools** These are suitable for both non-programmers and experienced coders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
3.  **Technical AI Tools** Primarily designed for developers and programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

While tools are generally geared towards specific users, it's possible for anyone to use any tool, though the experience may vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Choosing a Tool

When selecting an AI coding tool, two major factors are crucial:

### 1. Control

The level of control a tool offers directly correlates with how much you can edit or manipulate the generated code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>:

*   **Less Control:** Lovable offers minimal code editing control, which can be a feature for non-technical users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Moderate Control:** Bolt and v0 provide access to the code for tweaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Replit offers even more control for creating files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **High Control:** Tempo Labs allows editing components and pages similar to Figma, while still providing code access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Onlook is good for technical or semi-technical people who struggle with design, providing good-looking landing pages and the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

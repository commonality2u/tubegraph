The digital landscape has seen a historical wave of directory companies emerge as information became digitized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. These platforms aggregate existing data to make sense of information, with examples like Nomad List helping digital nomads find suitable cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Many such directory companies have become quite sizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.

## Custom GPTs: The Next Frontier for Directories
The next evolution for directory companies and websites lies in becoming [[building_a_gptpowered_ai_startup | custom GPTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. While existing directories like Nomad List are useful, a [[building_a_gptpowered_ai_startup | custom GPT]] offers a superior experience by allowing users to interact and personalize their search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. For instance, a user could chat with a Nomad List GPT to specify preferences like good weather, a budget under $1,000 per month, or visa requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:23:09]</a>. This demonstrates how any existing directory can be significantly improved through a [[building_a_gptpowered_ai_startup | custom GPT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

## Monetization and Value Proposition
The potential for monetizing [[building_a_gptpowered_ai_startup | custom GPTs]] is emerging, with one example being a lawyer who reportedly owns top legal GPTs and uses them for lead generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:52]</a>. This approach allows users to prompt for legal documents like contracts, and the lawyer can then offer direct legal services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:06]</a>.

For a [[building_a_gptpowered_ai_startup | custom GPT]] to be monetizable and sustainable, it must leverage specialized data that is not readily available through general AI models like [[comparing_chatgpt_pro_and_perplexity_ai | ChatGPT]] or Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:31]</a>. If the same information can be obtained from these broader tools, there isn't a viable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. However, a [[building_a_gptpowered_ai_startup | custom GPT]] that is uniquely effective at meeting specific user needs can be monetized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. Beyond direct monetization through ads, affiliates, or products, the lead generation mechanism is particularly interesting and applicable to many topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:53]</a>.

## Approachable Ways to Make Money with AI
One approachable way to make money on the internet without coding is by selling AI services on Upwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Solo developers or small teams are making between $5,000 and $20,000 a month by utilizing prompting apps found on Upwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This approach is also valuable for identifying business problems and potential [[building_a_saas_app_using_ai | SaaS businesses]] by observing demand on platforms like Upwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Vibe Coding: A Rapid Development Methodology
"Vibe coding" is a method of rapidly building and selling applications, often utilizing AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The core principle is to find a buyer for an app *before* it is built, which validates the need and simplifies the sales process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Finding Opportunities on Upwork
To find app development opportunities:
*   Search for existing technologies that a custom app could replace or improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. For example, some jobs require AirTable consulting, but a custom app might be cheaper and better than AirTable's per-seat costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   Look for "custom app development" or "automations" as keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Most automations can be converted into an app with a frontend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   Prioritize "CRUD apps" (Create, Read, Update, Delete) that primarily involve putting data into a database, pulling it, and visualizing it, as these are typically easier to build and deploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   Be mindful of pricing: while a low fixed price like $125 might be offered, some clients are willing to pay significantly more (e.g., $2,500) for similar solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. It's possible to submit proposals for higher than the listed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Building and Selling Apps with AI
The typical workflow for "vibe coding" involves:
1.  **Prototyping:** Build a basic prototype, even a mock-up landing page or dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>. This can be done quickly using tools like VO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.
2.  **Loom Video Pitch:** Record a short video demonstrating the prototype, flattering the client by mentioning their company name, and explaining how the custom app is a better solution than existing software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>.
3.  **AI for Requirements (PRD):** Use tools like ChatGPT to convert job descriptions or client requirements into a Product Requirements Document (PRD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. A PRD outlines features and data types for an engineer or AI to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
4.  **AI Coding Assistants:** Feed the PRD into an AI coding assistant like Replet's V2 (which uses Cloud 3.7) to generate the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Replet excels at getting from idea to MVP with minimal friction, handling package management and deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
5.  **UI Design:** Specify UI libraries like Shad CN for pre-built components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. For more advanced UI, describe the page's function in VO to generate front-end code, which can then be integrated into Replet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

### [[challenges_and_solutions_in_ai_app_development | Challenges and Solutions in AI App Development]]
While AI can build solid apps, particularly CRUD applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, some complexities remain:
*   **Complex Integrations:** Integrations like payment processors (Stripe), e-signature services (DocuSign), or complex calendaring and AI with date formatting and time zones can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. However, AI can still flawlessly set up basic API integrations like OAuth for services such as HubSpot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Operations that change data in other apps or servers (POST requests) require careful attention to security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
*   **Quality Assurance:** It's recommended to have a human developer specialize in the final 15% of the project to "kick the tires" and ensure production readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. Developers can be hired for hourly or fixed fees through platforms like Replet's "bounties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
*   **Data Privacy:** For certain applications (e.g., those handling student data), strict data privacy laws must be considered and implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.

### Monetization and Business Models
*   **Fixed-Price Projects:** Start by selling apps for a fixed price, like the first app sold for $750 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Recurring Revenue:** Charge clients for ongoing support, future feature requests, and hosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Consulting vs. SaaS:** This approach is essentially [[utilizing_ai_and_tools_for_business_development | AI-powered consulting]]. While multi-million dollar SaaS businesses are a goal for some, building custom apps for businesses is a more direct, lower-risk approach to generating revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
    *   **Service (Easy Mode):** Getting paid for a service by building custom solutions is the easiest mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. It derisks the process by securing payment upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
    *   **B2B SaaS (Medium Mode):** Building a SaaS app for businesses (e.g., targeting 10 clients who pay $1,000/month) is a viable medium-difficulty path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.
    *   **B2C SaaS (Hard Mode):** Building a viral mobile app for consumers (e.g., Calai, which analyzes food calories from photos and generates $30 million/year) is harder due to significant distribution challenges and marketing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

## Future Trends: Unbundling Existing SaaS with AI
A significant future market opportunity will involve "unbundling existing SaaS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. This means using AI to reverse-engineer and clone existing SaaS products (e.g., an Ahrefs clone) by leveraging public APIs, making them significantly cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. This allows individuals to build apps for specific niches or offer a more cost-effective alternative to established software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.

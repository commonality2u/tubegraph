Manis AI is a Chinese AI application designed to transform ideas into fully automated businesses and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This article explores a demonstration of Manis AI's capabilities, its process, and its limitations in attempting to build and analyze various business concepts.

## Understanding Manis AI

Manis AI differentiates itself from typical AI tools by functioning as a multi-agent system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. It incorporates planning and execution agents, reminiscent of early "Baby AGI" concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The tool creates a virtual sandbox where it can run command-line executions, operate a browser, and utilize various tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This allows it to conduct its own research, plan, design, execute tasks, analyze results, and replan as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. It can crawl websites, scrape data, and even take screenshots to gather necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

Manis AI aims to simplify the process of [[building_and_using_aipowered_tools_for_business_processes | building and using AI-powered tools for business processes]], particularly for non-technical users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. Instead of requiring users to combine multiple AI tools (like ChatGPT for ideas, v0 for design, and Cursor for building), Manis AI attempts to perform all these functions within its environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Users can start with a simple request, and Manis AI will autonomously research and plan the execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. A notable feature is its "human-in-the-loop" capability, allowing users to interrupt ongoing processes to provide additional context or redirect its efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

The underlying architecture of Manis AI is believed to involve a framework with an "army of agents" and fine-tuned AI models for specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

## Attempt 1: Building a DocuSign Clone

The demonstration began with a highly ambitious goal: to create a DocuSign clone, aiming for a multi-billion dollar business concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> and potentially generating $1,000 per day in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The initial prompt was simply: "create a DocuSign clone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>.
Manis AI immediately began by researching DocuSign's core features, user flows, and technical requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. It navigated to DocuSign's website to gather information on its product features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Human Intervention
During the research phase, the user intervened to specify that the focus should be solely on the e-signature product, rather than all of DocuSign's offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Manis AI acknowledged this clarification and adjusted its approach accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

### Development and Deployment Challenges
Manis AI proceeded to set up a project structure, create code for a Next.js application, including routes, login/register pages, passwords, and middleware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>. It successfully generated the code files and document structure for the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.

However, Manis AI encountered issues during the deployment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. It initially suggested running the application locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a> and struggled to create a deployable zip file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>. Despite multiple attempts and user prompts to retry deployment, the app was not successfully deployed to a public network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

## Attempt 2: Researching Startup Ideas

A new Manis AI session was initiated to evaluate startup ideas from the host's various platforms (X, YouTube, podcast) and determine which had the highest potential for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

Manis AI began by extensively researching the host's online presence, including personal websites, X (formerly Twitter) profiles, YouTube channels, LinkedIn, and Instagram, attempting to scrape all available information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. It even navigated to links within the host's social media bios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

### Encountering Issues
During this research task, Manis AI frequently got "stuck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>, indicating it was having difficulty collecting data, possibly due to the sheer volume of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. Eventually, it reported a "critical issue" and suggested resetting its computer or starting a new session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>. Resetting the computer allowed it to remember where it left off, but the task ultimately remained incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.

## Attempt 3: Improving SEO for a Design Agency

The next task involved using Manis AI to improve the SEO for a design agency's website, with the specific goal of attracting executives from AI-first companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.

Manis AI accepted the request and confirmed its understanding of the targeted audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>.

### Context Limitation
However, Manis AI quickly encountered an issue, stating, "Manis performance may decline with extremely long context" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. This highlighted a significant limitation: Manis AI struggles with complex tasks that require processing a large amount of information, often leading to context limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

## Attempt 4: Creating an Airplane Game

A final attempt was made to create a simple airplane game, similar to Peter Levels' `fly.peter.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. This request was made in a new session after hitting a daily usage limit in a previous session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>.

Manis AI successfully created and deployed a basic airplane game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. The game features a plane flying and the ability to shoot down balloons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>. While more basic than some examples, its creation and deployment from a single prompt were considered "pretty cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>.

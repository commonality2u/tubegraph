Zach Yagari, a 17-year-old developer who built an AI app generating over $1 million a month, shares insights into the go-to-market strategies for tech products, particularly consumer-facing AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. His approach emphasizes designing the product with marketing in mind and leveraging specific pricing and growth tactics.

## Designing for Marketing and User Experience

When designing an app, it's crucial to consider the [[marketing_and_selling_apps | marketing and selling apps]] side from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

### Simplicity and Digestibility
Apps need to be simple and digestible for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This means making information easy to understand, such as using numerical danger levels (e.g., 0-5) rather than vague text descriptions (e.g., "fairly dangerous" vs. "very dangerous") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

### Reverse Engineering for Influencer Marketing
A key insight is to "reverse engineer how the influencer is going to show your product and building the pro designing the product around that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. This involves:
*   **Aesthetic Appeal:** Ensuring the app looks appealing enough to "wow" someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Simplicity:** Making sure the app's value is clear and understandable within a mere two seconds of viewing on an influencer video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   **Branding Placement:** Placing the app's name prominently on the homepage and especially on the "wow factor" screens that influencers are most likely to showcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. For a medical AI app like "Dr. AI," the scan screen and results are key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

## Influencer Marketing Strategy

[[innovative_marketing_strategies_for_startups | Innovative marketing strategies for startups]] for consumer apps often involve influencer marketing. This is preferred for utility apps that may have low shareability organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

### Identifying Target Audience and Influencers
*   **Audience First:** When considering influencers, always prioritize analyzing their audience rather than just their niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. This can be done by manually reading comments on their posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>.
*   **Targeting Concerned Parents:** For an app like "Dr. AI," a primary target audience would be mothers concerned about their kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>. Influencers who are "moms of seven" or "Day in the Life" content creators focused on parenting would be ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Content Angle:** Influence videos can play on emotions, like mild "fear-mongering," showing a realistic scenario where the app alleviates a health concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. An example is a story of a parent worried about a bump on their child's skin, only for the app to confirm it's harmless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.

### Outreach and Deal Structuring
*   **Outreach:** Reach out to influencers via both email and direct message (DM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.
*   **Pricing Structure:** Deals should be structured around RPM (Revenue Per Mille/Thousand views) and CPM (Cost Per Mille/Thousand views) to ensure profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.
    *   Influencers are paid upfront, not on a pay-per-view basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.
    *   To ensure RPM > CPM, predict the number of views the influencer is likely to get <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.
    *   For example, if an influencer averages 250K views per video, four videos would yield 1 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. With an assumed RPM of $5, paying the influencer under $5,000 for those 1 million views (i.e., a CPM under $5) would be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

## Pricing Strategies for Consumer Apps

[[pricing_strategies_for_ai_startups | Pricing strategies for AI startups]] are crucial for revenue generation, especially for apps with repeat but infrequent use.

### Weekly Pricing Model
For utility apps like "Dr. AI" or "Riz GPT" (an AI wingman app), a weekly pricing model can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
*   Users might subscribe, use the product for a specific need, unsubscribe, and then resubscribe when the need arises again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.
*   This model capitalizes on repeat users who subscribe on an "as-needed" basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>.
*   It's suggested to start with a weekly price around $4, potentially experimenting with $7, though $7 can be considered steep (equating to nearly $30/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.

### A/B Testing Pricing Structures
It's vital to A/B test various pricing options and free trial variations to find the "sweet spot" that yields the highest proceeds per download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>.
*   Test weekly rates (e.g., $4, $7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.
*   Test monthly rates (e.g., $10, $15, $20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.
*   Test annual rates (e.g., $30, $40, $50, $70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.
*   Include variations with and without free trials for all options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>. Tools like Superwall can be used for this A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Ethical Considerations and Accuracy
> When developing AI applications, especially in sensitive areas like health, it is critical to include clear disclaimers that the AI's advice is not 100% accurate or a substitute for professional medical opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Ensuring the accuracy of the AI's responses through robust prompting and pipelines is essential to avoid providing misleading or harmful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.

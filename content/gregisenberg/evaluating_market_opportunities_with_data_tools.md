This article explores how entrepreneurs can effectively evaluate market opportunities and identify consumer demands using various data and analytical tools. Ashwin, a brand and physical product expert, shares insights on leveraging these resources, applicable to both consumer packaged goods (CPG) and software startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Identifying Demand and Trends with Ahrefs

Ahrefs is a powerful tool primarily used in the [[seo_and_tools_for_market_trends | SEO]] world, but it offers valuable insights for evaluating category demand and market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Key features of Ahrefs include:
*   **Search Volume**: Provides a general sense of how many times a keyword or term is searched on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Keyword Difficulty**: Indicates the difficulty of ranking for a specific term on Google, scaled from 0 to 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Practical Applications
By leveraging Ahrefs, businesses can perform a "gut check" on an idea before significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>:

*   **Evaluating Category Demand**: For example, searching "electrolytes" reveals high search volume and seasonal trends (peaks in June/July) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Assessing Competition**: A high keyword difficulty (e.g., 88 for "electrolytes") indicates significant competition, suggesting that ranking organically would be an "impossible endeavor" requiring substantial time, money, and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Identifying Niche Opportunities**: Observing search volume distribution by country can reveal untapped markets, such as a demand for electrolytes in non-English speaking countries like Germany or India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This strategy, similar to replicating successful US tech companies in Europe, leverages proven business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Analyzing Trends and Market Shifts**: The rise and fall of search interest for terms like "CBD" (explosive in 2019 after the 2018 farm bill, then declining) and "Delta 9" (growing since 2020) can illustrate how consumer preferences evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

Ashwin emphasizes the importance of asking *why* trends exist, rather than just observing the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Particle for Competitive Analysis and Product Insights

Particle is a tool that allows users to type in any e-commerce brand to view non-public sales data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This provides crucial [[role_of_competitive_analysis_tools_in_business_strategy | competitive analysis]] and product insights, helping businesses de-risk product decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

Particle's key features include:
*   **Competitor Sales Data**: Shows sales figures over time for specific e-commerce brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Product Category Breakdown**: Displays the categories in which a brand offers products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **Best-Selling SKUs**: Identifies a brand's top-performing products, often revealing that a large percentage of revenue comes from a few core offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This helps in understanding which flavors or product variations are most successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   **Trend Explorer**: Offers insights into trending products and categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

Similar data, though not as detailed, can also be found on platforms like TikTok Shop and Amazon, which often show sales figures for products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

## Strategic Product Differentiation

Even in categories with high demand (like magnesium supplements), differentiation is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

### Branding and Design
*   **Standing Out Visually**: Many products in a category might appear generic or "medical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Brands like Moon Juice (amber jar) and Lemi (custom bottling, purple aesthetic) demonstrate how distinctive packaging and brand identity can make a product "striking" and appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.
*   **Targeting Niches**: It is often more effective to initially target a specific niche with hyper-targeted positioning and language before expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.
*   **Overlooked Demographics**: There's a significant opportunity to apply sophisticated branding and design to products for demographics that are currently underserved, such as older adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Many brands are created by younger, coastal individuals, leading to "Millennial Blanding" or Gen Z aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. Targeting older demographics, who often have more disposable income and consume information from less saturated channels, can be a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

## Leveraging AI Tools for Startup Design and Market Research

[[evaluating_ai_tools_for_startup_design_and_market_research | AI tools for startup design and market research]] offer a "bootstrap way" to sketch out ideas and gather data before significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

### Manis for Product Design and Research
Manis is an [[ai_tools_for_startup_ideas | AI tool for startup ideas]] that can assist in designing CPG products and performing market research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>. It can:
*   Research competitors (e.g., pimple patch market) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.
*   Analyze product details and market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.
*   Research specific demographic needs (e.g., skincare for adults in their 60s and 70s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

AI tools like Manis act as an "unfair advantage" for founders, providing comprehensive reports that would otherwise be expensive and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. There is also a significant opportunity to create specialized AI tools, such as a "V0 for CPG," to automate design and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.

Founders can combine AI-generated V1 designs (e.g., from Midjourney) with freelance designers on platforms like Fiverr or Upwork to achieve quality packaging and landing pages at a low cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>. This iterative process helps clarify the vision before engaging expensive agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

## The Importance of Research and Distribution

Regardless of the product type, founders must be "relentless researcher[s] of the category and the competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. This involves:
*   Reading extensively about the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.
*   Analyzing every competitor's brand, website, visuals, and language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.
*   Talking to store owners, staff, and customers to understand what is selling, what people are looking for, and pain points with existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

This in-depth research builds confidence in the brand's direction and helps avoid building products based solely on hunches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

A core principle for any startup is to [[using_ai_to_analyze_trends_and_generate_business_concepts | work backwards from distribution]], focusing on how to acquire customers and which channels will lead to success, *before* building the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. This aligns with the adage:
> "First time Founders focus on product, second time Founders focus on distribution." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>

Products with "incredible distribution and operational excellence" can often outperform technically superior products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

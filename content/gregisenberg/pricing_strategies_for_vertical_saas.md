Effective pricing is often overlooked in software development, despite its critical importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. A key strategy for [[pricing_strategies_for_digital_products | pricing]] in [[understanding_vertical_saas_business_models | vertical SaaS]] involves a scientific approach rooted in understanding the value provided to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>.

## Core Value Proposition

When considering [[pricing strategies for digital products | pricing]], it's essential to understand what the customer is currently paying for the problem your software solves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. A fundamental belief in software development is that solutions must either:
*   Increase revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>
*   Decrease costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>
*   Prevent customer churn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>
*   Maintain compliance (especially in highly regulated industries where it's a "need to have") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>

These criteria ensure that the software delivers clear Return on Investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.

## Leveraging Payments and Transactions

A significant opportunity to scale [[understanding_vertical_saas_business_models | vertical SaaS]] businesses is by integrating payments and owning the transaction flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:29">[00:46:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>. Large, industry-specific software companies typically own the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

For example, Toast, a restaurant software company, significantly expanded its market size by implementing [[implementing_payments_in_vertical_saas_solutions | payments]] and taking a percentage of every transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. While charging a small monthly fee for software might result in a limited market size (e.g., $120 million for a million restaurants at $10/month), adding a small percentage of a trillion-dollar industry's revenue radically increases the total addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

This strategy suggests building a [[developing_a_wedge_product_in_vertical_saas | wedge product]] that exists either before or after the core transaction, allowing the eventual capture of the transaction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.

## Developing a Pricing Model

A straightforward approach to [[pricing strategies for digital products | pricing]] involves understanding the monetary value of the problem being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

**Example: Student Retention Tool for Trade Schools**
1.  **Identify the Problem**: Trade schools experienced student attrition, leading to millions in lost revenue annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.
2.  **Develop a Solution**: A tool was created to analyze academic and attendance data, predict at-risk students, and automatically send motivational texts with resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.
3.  **Quantify Value**: Knowing that tuition was $20,000 per student and that the school's retention rate was around 70%, the potential savings from retaining even a few students (e.g., five students) were substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.
4.  **Price Based on ROI**: The software could be priced significantly higher because it directly translated to saving students and generating revenue for the schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
    *   Forecast the number of students saved and the corresponding revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.
    *   Communicate the forecasted ROI to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
    *   Price the product at a portion of that ROI, typically aiming for 50% initially and adjusting based on market feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.

This "first principles" approach focuses on breaking down the monetary value the software creates and requesting a share of that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>.

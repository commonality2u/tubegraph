Brett from Designjoy, a one-man designer, utilizes [[leveraging_ai_for_content_and_image_generation | AI]] to produce exceptional designs and generate millions of dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These [[generating_content_with_ai_tools | AI tools]] are powerful and simplify the process of creating beautiful graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The core idea is that [[using_ai_tools_for_content_creation | AI creation]] is surprisingly easy, even for non-designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Accessibility for Non-Designers
Individuals without prior design knowledge can create significant value using [[using_ai_tools_for_content_creation | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. While good taste helps, there is no inherent skill barrier for non-creatives to produce impressive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Most content generated by Brett is not specifically for designers but for anyone with a Midjourney or ChatGPT subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Types of AI Generation
The current phase of generative [[ai_tools_for_business_and_content_creation | AI]] includes various realms such as image generation and video generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Key AI Tools and Their Applications

### Higgsfield
Higgsfield is an ideal starting point for those with no prior experience in [[using_ai_tools_for_content_creation | AI creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. It offers templates and presets that simplify the process of generating content, making it easy to create ads for products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The tool simplifies prompt engineering by providing preset actions and effects, addressing the difficulty of "talking" to AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. It can even consider product branding and text, which was historically a "problem child" for [[generating_content_with_ai_tools | AI generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Users don't need to prompt it, as it relies on presets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Midjourney
Midjourney is primarily used for generating images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. It excels at artistic styling, allowing users to create visually unique images by referencing specific styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Users provide a prompt and can incorporate image prompts (to influence content) and style references (to influence aesthetics like colors, shadows, and depth of field) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Mixing different styles can lead to surprising generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### ChatGPT
ChatGPT is crucial for crafting effective prompts for [[ai_tools_for_business_and_content_creation | AI models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. It removes the need for advanced writing skills to describe desired outputs, a task that was once difficult before its capabilities improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. ChatGPT can generate multiple prompt options from a simple request, adding rich detail that enhances the final image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. It can even dream up entire collections of images based on a theme, allowing for varied scenes without explicit instructions for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Runway
Runway is a tool used to add motion to static images, transforming them into videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Users can upload an image and provide a prompt (often generated by ChatGPT) to dictate the movement within the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Runway can produce high-quality video output and offers options to upscale videos to 4K resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. It understands specific instructions like keeping the camera still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

### Cling
Cling is another [[ai_models_for_generating_photorealistic_images_and_ad_content | image to video tool]] that allows users to set start and end frames, enabling seamless video loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. It also provides AI-generated sound options that are contextually relevant to the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

### Other Tools
*   **Magnific Upscaler**: Used to enhance generated images, adding super-rich details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Photoshop**: Can be used for generative fill after initial [[leveraging_ai_for_content_and_image_generation | AI generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Cap Cut**: A user-friendly video editing platform for adding text layers to generated videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

## Workflow for AI-Generated Visuals
A common workflow involves:
1.  **Idea Conception**: Start with a basic idea of what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
2.  **Prompt Generation**: Use ChatGPT to create detailed prompts based on your idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
3.  **Style Reference**: Find a desired style (e.g., from Pinterest) to use as a style reference in Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
4.  **Image Generation**: Plug the prompt and style reference into Midjourney to generate artistic images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. These can serve as base images for videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
5.  **Motion Addition**: Upload the generated images to Runway or Cling and provide prompts to add motion, creating videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
6.  **Video Extension (Optional)**: For longer continuous shots, save the last frame of one video as an image, then upload it as the start frame for the next video, stitching them together later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
7.  **Refinement**: Use tools like Magnific Upscaler for detail enhancement or Cap Cut for adding text layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

## Opportunities and Use Cases
[[ai_tools_for_business_and_content_creation | AI tools]] present significant opportunities for creatives and startups:
*   **Branding**: The biggest opportunity currently lies in branding, allowing for the rapid generation of consistent visual assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. Midjourney can be used to set up mood boards, ensuring continuity across generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.
*   **Ad Content**: These tools are excellent for creating engaging ads for platforms like Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.
*   **Creative Exploration**: They enable the generation of complex and beautiful visuals that were previously unachievable for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

## Limitations
Despite their power, [[ai_tools_for_business_and_content_creation | AI tools]] have limitations:
*   **Web Design**: [[AI tools and design automation | AI]] in web design is still developing, with current outputs being "pretty mediocre" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
*   **Logo Design**: [[AI tools and design automation | AI]] is not yet proficient at logo design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.
*   **Text and Vector Art**: Text generation, while improved, isn't always perfect, and vector art is not supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.
*   **Fickleness**: Tools like Midjourney and Runway can be "finicky," sometimes producing unexpected results, requiring users to adjust prompts and re-generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Video Length**: Current tools often limit video generation to short clips (e.g., 10 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

Users are encouraged to experiment and "get their hands dirty" with these tools to understand their capabilities and produce remarkable results with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.

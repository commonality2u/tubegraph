For startups facing the "cold start problem" of acquiring an audience and leads, it's possible to gain customers without being a social media influencer, relying heavily on ads, or even consistently [[Creating content that resonates with online communities | creating content]] from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:59">[01:21:59]</a>. This approach focuses on leveraging existing audiences and delivering extreme value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

## The Dream 100 Method

The "Dream 100" is a strategic approach to [[building_and_growing_an_online_audience | building an audience]] by identifying and collaborating with individuals or organizations who already have access to your target customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

### Creating Your Dream 100 List
The first step is to create a spreadsheet (like Excel or Google Sheet) listing 100 people or organizations who are already communicating with your desired audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

For a web design agency targeting startup founders and small businesses, examples could include:
*   **The Startup Ideas Podcast** (the podcast itself or its host, Greg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **Product Hunt**: A website that serves the startup community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   **Local entrepreneur meetups**: Identify who runs these events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

This list serves as a research project to understand potential partners and their audience size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. Even researching potential partners can generate many ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

### Engaging with Your Dream 100
Once you have your list, the next step is to determine what you can offer these individuals or organizations to gain exposure to their audience while providing them significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

*   **The Canvas Strategy**: This method, detailed by Ryan Holiday, helps in being helpful to Gatekeepers or those above you in the business hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. It's crucial not to simply ask for favors, but to offer value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. Jonathan Courtney's pitching to become an occasional host on The Startup Ideas Podcast was an example of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.
*   **Paid Collaborations/Advertising**: Directly paying for exposure on platforms or with influencers can be highly effective. For example, purchasing an ad on John Gruber's Daring Fireball blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a> or initiating a paid collaboration with a large creator like Chris Do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>.
*   **Gifting**: Thoughtful and personalized gifts can be a powerful, underrated tool to get someone on your side, building trust and memorability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02:00">[31:02:00]</a>. Examples include:
    *   A $50,000 signed guitar for a mentor's top Dream 100 person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:10:00">[29:10:00]</a>.
    *   An $80 Teenage Engineering device for a business partner, knowing their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:00">[32:07:07]</a>.
    *   Mini Buddhas (costing $5-7 each) given during meetings to build lasting connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:42:00">[32:42:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to be a "slug hanging on to the back" of a trusted person who already talks to your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.

## Utilizing Groups and Communities

Another strategy is to identify where your target audience congregates online and then actively participate by delivering extreme value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>.

*   **Find Your Audience's Hubs**: Look for communities on platforms like:
    *   School groups (e.g., Startup Empire) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>.
    *   Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>.
    *   Facebook Groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>.
    *   Reddit groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>.
    *   YouTube channel comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07:00">[24:07:00]</a>.
    *   Quora: A platform where people ask and answer questions, providing insight into audience needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:00:00">[41:00:00]</a>.
*   **Be the Most Valuable Person**: Spend time in these groups providing helpful answers and resources without spamming or directly promoting your services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>. Offer free templates or detailed advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>.
*   **Engage with Creators**: Turn on notifications for relevant creators in your niche and be the first to leave thoughtful, valuable comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:00">[25:34:00]</a>. This builds trust with the creator and attracts other commenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a>. Sharing the creator's content also demonstrates genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:00">[26:27:00]</a>.

By observing challenges and delivering solutions, you can generate leads organically and affordably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>.

## Creating High-Value Content (Low Quality, High Effort)
While not needing a personal brand, [[developing_content_ideas_and_strategies_on_youtube | creating content]] can significantly ease the customer acquisition process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:37:00">[35:37:00]</a>. The focus should be on delivering immense value rather than high production quality or being the "face" of the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:10:00">[39:10:00]</a>.

*   **Mastering Doom Example**: This YouTube channel creates extremely long, valuable tutorials (11-15 hours) that attract an audience due to their utility, rather than individual personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:32:00">[39:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:37:00">[39:37:00]</a>. People who find the tutorials valuable naturally seek out the company behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:45:00">[39:45:00]</a>.
*   **Give Away Your "Course" for Free**: Instead of selling courses, create highly produced, valuable tutorials and release them for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:42:00">[40:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[40:50:00]</a>. This can make people feel "guilty for consuming it" due to the overwhelming value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:55:00">[40:55:00]</a>.
*   **Directly Address Audience Questions**: Go to platforms like Quora or community groups, identify common questions, and create detailed, long-form videos answering them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:00:00">[41:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>. For example, a web designer could record a five-hour video showing how to build a responsive landing page from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:19:00">[41:19:00]</a>.
*   **Low Quality, High Effort**: The production quality doesn't need to be high. Many people appreciate raw, authentic content they can passively watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:49:00">[43:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:42:00">[44:42:00]</a>. The focus is on demonstrating your expertise and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:18:00">[45:18:00]</a>.

These [[strategies_for_effective_content_creation | content creation strategies]] can be particularly effective for selling software or SaaS products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:15:00">[42:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:18:00">[42:18:00]</a>.

> "Low quality is the new high quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:50:00">[43:50:00]</a>.
> "Low quality doesn't mean low effort. What you want to do is low quality, high effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:30:00">[44:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:35:00">[44:35:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways
These two primary methods—the Dream 100 and active community engagement—can generate approximately 80% of your initial clients in the first few months, even without a significant social media presence or ad budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. They represent "hyper high leverage" activities for a new business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:40:00">[48:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:44:00">[48:44:00]</a>.

It's important to remember that these strategies only work if you are genuinely skilled at what you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.

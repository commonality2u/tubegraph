For startup founders and entrepreneurs who need to acquire customers without a pre-existing social following or significant ad spend, a few simple, highly effective strategies exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This article explores these methods, focusing on leveraging existing audiences and communities.

## The Dream 100 Method

The "Dream 100" method is a strategy to identify and partner with individuals or organizations who already have access to your target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The core idea is to leverage their reach to gain visibility for your startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### How to Implement Dream 100

1.  **Create Your List:**
    *   Make a list, ideally in a spreadsheet, of people or organizations who are already speaking with or have access to your desired audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   This list can include individuals, companies, or even local meetups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    *   **Example (Web Design Agency):** If you're starting a web design agency targeting startup founders and small businesses, your "Dream 100" might include:
        *   The host of the [[brainstorming_startup_ideas | Startup Ideas Podcast]] (Greg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
        *   Product Hunt (a website for new products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
        *   Organizers of local entrepreneur meetups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
    *   Gather their main websites, social media links, and audience size to understand their reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Even researching potential partners can spark new [[techniques_for_brainstorming_and_validating_startup_ideas | ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

2.  **Determine Your Offer/Value:**
    *   For each entry on your list, consider what you can offer them to gain exposure to their audience while providing significant value to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   This could involve:
        *   **Paid Advertisement:** Directly paying for an ad, as done with Daring Fireball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
        *   **Collaboration:** Pitching an idea for a collaboration, such as becoming an occasional podcast host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a> or a co-branded project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
        *   **Gifting:** Offering a personalized, meaningful gift to build a relationship and get on their side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>. This doesn't have to be expensive (e.g., a $5 Buddha statue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.

3.  **Master the Outreach (Canvas Strategy):**
    *   Simply asking for access to their audience can be "insulting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
    *   The **Canvas Strategy** (a concept by Ryan Holiday) focuses on being helpful to gatekeepers or those above you in the business hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
    *   Prepare a well-thought-out pitch explaining why the partnership is valuable to *them* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
    *   This approach has generated tens of millions of dollars for some businesses by focusing on key partners like Jake Knapp (author of *Sprint*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

## Leveraging Groups and Communities

Another highly effective strategy involves actively engaging with communities where your target audience congregates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

1.  **Identify Audience Hubs:**
    *   Locate online groups and communities (e.g., Discord, School, Facebook groups, Reddit, Quora comments) where your potential clients spend their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.
    *   Examples include the [[content_strategy_and_idea_generation_for_startups | Startup Empire.co]] community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

2.  **Deliver Extreme Value (No Spamming):**
    *   Join these groups and dedicate time to being the "most valuable person" there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
    *   Focus on genuinely helping others by answering questions thoroughly and providing free resources or templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
    *   This builds trust and organically generates leads without direct self-promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.
    *   Actively observe common challenges within these groups to tailor your valuable contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

3.  **Engage with Creators:**
    *   Turn on notifications for creators or channels in your niche (e.g., [[brainstorming_startup_ideas | Startup Ideas Podcast]] on YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.
    *   Be among the first to leave thoughtful, valuable comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. This builds trust with the creator and other commenters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
    *   Sharing the creator's content also demonstrates genuine interest and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

4.  **Create "Low Quality, High Effort" Content:**
    *   Beyond direct engagement, create valuable, long-form tutorials or demonstrations based on common questions found in these communities (e.g., Quora) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
    *   Platforms like YouTube are ideal for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
    *   Focus on delivering immense value, even if the production quality is low. "Low quality is the new high quality" when the content is exceptionally helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.
    *   The goal is to show potential clients how skilled you are, making them prefer to hire you rather than attempt the task themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.

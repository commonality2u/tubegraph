Apps are achieving millions of downloads by effectively utilizing TikTok, which is considered an underpriced distribution channel for consumer apps [00:00:00, 00:01:44]. Joseph Choy identifies a formula for how apps acquire users virally on TikTok [00:00:11, 00:01:00]. The low cost of creating and distributing content on the platform makes these strategies accessible for various consumer apps [00:01:50, 00:01:54]. Some AI apps have achieved millions of downloads and significant monthly revenue within a short period by mastering TikTok [00:02:09, 00:02:16].

## The Power of TikTok Organic

TikTok's organic reach is currently the most underpriced distribution channel available [00:01:41, 00:01:46]. The platform functions as the modern-day equivalent of the App Store's early distribution power, where content discovery drives downloads rather than users actively searching within the App Store [00:16:59, 00:17:27]. A successful TikTok strategy can lead to a surge in downloads, which in turn boosts an app's ranking and leads to further [[organic_growth_and_marketing_for_apps | organic downloads]] through App Store Optimization (ASO) [00:17:32, 00:17:57]. This initial TikTok boost can provide long-term benefits [00:17:57].

## Borrowing from E-commerce Marketing

A significant [[trends_in_tiktok_marketing_borrowed_from_the_ecommerce_sector | trend in TikTok marketing]] for apps involves adapting tactics from the e-commerce sector [00:02:26, 00:02:33, 00:03:51]. TikTok Shop, released in November 2022, has driven two years of innovation in e-commerce marketing [00:02:35, 00:02:50].

### Mass UGC Production

E-commerce brands like Tabs Chocolate (which grew from zero to $10 million annually) utilize mass [[the_role_of_usergenerated_content_and_influencers_in_app_promotion | UGC (user-generated content)]] creators [00:02:55, 00:03:14]. They hire numerous creators, often teenagers, organize them in Discord servers, and mass-produce content daily [00:03:07, 00:03:14]. Tabs Chocolate's founder, Oliver, even pivoted to a micro SaaS business (a homework helper app) using the same marketing tactics, benefiting from higher margins compared to e-commerce [00:03:16, 00:03:43].

### Slideshow and AI-Generated Content

While traditional TikTok marketing often conjures images of short-form videos, carousel or slideshow content formats are proving highly effective [00:07:21, 00:07:54]. These are easier to create than videos, especially when utilizing AI tools like Midjourney for images [00:07:41, 00:07:46, 00:04:21].

*   **Colostrum Example**: A colostrum supplement brand uses AI-generated images with audio clips and common pain points (energy, brain fog) as hooks. These slideshows go viral daily, driving traffic to Amazon despite small conversion rates [00:04:07, 00:05:12].
*   **POV App Example**: The "POV" disposable camera app uses similar slideshows featuring wedding angles and AI actors. Their content often starts with a strong negative hook (e.g., controversial wedding rules) and ends with a call to action to download the app [00:05:40, 00:06:16].
*   **What Colors App Example**: This AI-powered color analysis app, which scans faces to suggest suitable clothing and makeup, also uses simple slideshows that have gone viral, driving millions of likes and leading to app downloads [00:14:00, 00:14:55]. These single-utility apps often monetize via paywalls, requiring weekly or annual subscriptions after an initial onboarding and analysis [00:15:05, 00:15:29]. The ease of [[consumer_mobile_app_development_strategies | iOS subscriptions]] (e.g., "Double Tap to Pay" with Apple Pay) has contributed to the boom in app revenue [00:15:30, 00:16:13].

Creating slideshows is generally lower converting than human-led influencer videos, but they offer greater scale and a lower barrier to entry [00:08:02, 00:08:18]. The high competition in talking-head influencer marketing for e-commerce products (e.g., Goalie supplements offering expensive prizes to top affiliates) makes slideshows an attractive alternative with less competition [00:10:27, 00:10:52].

## Evolving Influencer Marketing for Apps

Traditional [[influencer_marketing_strategies for apps | influencer marketing]] from the Instagram era (paying influencers with millions of followers) is less effective on TikTok [00:33:16, 00:34:03]. TikTok's "For You Page" algorithm prioritizes content quality over audience size, meaning most content users see is from new or unfollowed accounts [00:33:47, 00:34:01].

### TikTok Shop Affiliate Center as a Tool

The TikTok Shop Affiliate Center provides valuable data on high-volume e-commerce products and the creators selling them [00:11:10, 00:11:29]. By filtering creators by industry (e.g., skincare) and GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume), one can identify experienced TikTok Shop affiliates [00:11:34, 00:12:15]. These creators are incentivized to make videos, but they primarily sell e-commerce products [00:12:27, 00:12:36]. This presents a significant opportunity to engage them in promoting apps instead [00:12:39].

### The "App as Utility" Strategy

Instead of direct product sales, an app can be used as a utility within a creator's existing content to subtly drive downloads [00:19:14]. For example, a skincare analysis app could be shown in a before-and-after video focusing on an e-commerce skincare product [00:19:32, 00:20:09]. The app interface flashes briefly, serving as a tool that helps the creator make better content [00:20:09, 00:20:31]. Influencers might even use such an app for free because it assists them in creating their [[the_role_of_usergenerated_content_and_influencers_in_app_promotion | TikTok Shop affiliate videos]] [00:20:25, 00:20:31]. This strategy is applicable across many niches like makeup, personal care, fashion, electronics, sports, and home improvement [00:20:38, 00:21:02].

Digital products like apps also benefit from lower price points (e.g., $2-10 weekly, $30-60 annually) compared to physical goods, making them easier for consumers to commit to, especially with seamless payment methods like "double click to pay" [00:21:06, 00:22:03]. The cost of goods for apps is virtually zero, making them infinitely scalable [00:21:54, 00:22:03].

## Discovering High-Value Niches and Movements

By targeting underserved demographics or tapping into established movements, apps can find underpriced content opportunities on TikTok [00:22:31, 00:22:48].

### Underserved Demographics

Contrary to popular belief, TikTok users span a wide range of demographics [00:22:24, 00:22:34]. Targeting niches where fewer creators operate can lead to underpriced content reaching affluent demographics willing to pay for products [00:22:38, 00:22:54].

*   **Golfers**: Golf is a niche with high-value customers. Apps offering [[modernizing_travel_itineraries_with_tiktok_influencers | AI golf swing analysis]] can provide tips on improving angle and speed [00:22:57, 00:23:44]. Existing TikTok videos already analyze golf swings, making it easy to integrate an app's interface [00:23:51, 00:24:06, 00:25:48, 00:27:08]. A top golf swing app currently makes $70,000/month from 10,000 downloads/month [00:24:26, 00:24:32]. This offers a more accessible alternative to expensive in-person coaching [00:24:49, 00:25:34]. The high quality of iPhone cameras and the advent of GPT Vision APIs make sophisticated analysis possible without external hardware [00:28:23, 00:28:52].
*   **MMA and Other Sports**: The KO MMA training app uses a "wireframe skeleton" concept to analyze movements in product demo videos [00:26:06, 00:26:38]. This visually striking format could be applied to other sports like tennis, golf, or pickleball, easily integrating an app's interface for movement analysis [00:26:38, 00:27:15].
*   **Poker**: Poker players represent a high lifetime value (LTV) customer base [00:29:08, 00:29:22]. Many existing poker TikTok videos are unmonetized or undemonetized (e.g., selling courses or sponsored by gambling sites) [00:30:17, 00:30:36]. An app could analyze hand histories or strategies, offering an educational component for beginners [00:29:47, 00:30:13]. Integrating the app's interface briefly into gameplay videos can spark interest in comments, leading to downloads [00:31:12, 00:31:49].

### Capitalizing on Cult Movements

[[applying_cult_movements_and_subcultures_to_consumer_app_growth | Building apps around existing "cult-like" movements or subcultures]] that lack a dedicated product can lead to significant revenue [00:40:58, 00:43:37]. This leverages strong existing motivations and beliefs. A general framework for finding such ideas is to consider what people want in life: health, wealth, and relationships [00:43:51, 00:44:26].

*   **Looksmaxing (Umax app)**: Umax capitalized on the "looksmaxing" movement, where men seek to improve their physical appearance [00:41:03, 00:41:20]. The app scans a face, provides scores, and offers tips on improving features like jawline, skin, and hair [00:41:48, 00:42:16]. This movement, with roots in niche internet communities, has gone mainstream and taps into insecurities and the desire for self-improvement and better relationships [00:42:33, 00:44:14].
*   **Wealth Generation (Crayo app)**: Crayo partnered with YouTubers and Tik Tokers who teach teenagers how to make money, particularly through repurposing streamer clips for TikTok and [[youtube_growth_strategies | YouTube Shorts]] [00:44:36, 00:45:07]. Initially, this was monetized through expensive courses [00:45:08, 00:45:14]. Crayo productized this course into software that automates video creation, shifting from promoting a course to promoting the software [00:45:17, 00:45:56]. This taps into the "cult of young money" [00:45:59, 00:46:04].
*   **Niche Dating (Lox Club)**: Lox Club, an exclusive dating app for Jewish people with high standards, creates content series like "how to find a nice Jewish boy in NYC" [00:37:55, 00:38:16]. When a content format works and is scalable, creating new, dedicated brand accounts (like "Lila Airbuds," "Stacy Airbuds," etc.) can be highly effective because the TikTok algorithm prioritizes showing specific content types to consistent audiences [00:38:57, 00:40:42].

## The Essential Role of Product Quality

While distribution strategies are crucial, the underlying product must be high quality and retain users [00:46:54, 00:47:18]. Before scaling marketing efforts to millions of people, it's essential to ensure the app is not a "leaky product" that users abandon quickly [00:47:24, 00:47:31]. Understanding metrics like customer lifetime value (LTV) and customer acquisition cost (CAC) requires knowing how many people pay and, more importantly, how many retain and continue to derive value from the product over time [00:47:42, 00:48:02]. A product that isn't retentive essentially becomes a one-time e-commerce sale rather than a scalable, subscription-based business [00:48:15, 00:48:28].

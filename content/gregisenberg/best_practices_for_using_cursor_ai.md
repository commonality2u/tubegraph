When delving into the world of AI-powered coding with tools like [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]], understanding best practices can save countless hours and help in building functional applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This guide outlines key strategies to get the best results from [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]] and similar tools.

## The Importance of Planning and Sketching

A fundamental step before engaging with AI coding assistants is thorough planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. It's not advisable to simply jump into [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]]'s composer and start asking it to build things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Even when using AI, adopting a developer mindset that includes planning what to build and its desired appearance is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

> "The biggest thing I would say is is planning and um I don't see enough people planning I see people just jumping on composer and telling you to make stuff and I think your outputs would be really really great if you did a lot if you did planning before you go to cursor." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>

This approach follows a "measure twice, cut once" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Visualizing Your Application

Having a visual representation, even simple sketches, significantly helps in providing context to AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Tools like Figma or even Paint can be used for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Handwritten drawings can also be effective; an example showed a web3 portfolio page drawn on an iPad, which was then uploaded to [[using_ai_tools_like_v0_replit_claude_ai_and_cursor_for_app_development | ChatGPT]] to help plan the structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

[[planning_and_sketching_before_using_ai_models | Planning and sketching]] helps in defining what you want the AI to do, treating it as a co-pilot rather than the boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This process is akin to "rubber ducking" in programming, where explaining your thoughts helps clarify your own ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Using V0 for Initial Mockups

For visualizing your application, [[using_ai_tools_like_v0_replit_claude_ai_and_cursor_for_app_development | V0]] is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. It helps in seeing what your potential app or MVP will look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For instance, you can describe a "clean looking Marketplace website for bicycle sellers" in [[using_ai_tools_like_v0_replit_claude_ai_and_cursor_for_app_development | V0]], and it will generate a visual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The code generated by [[using_ai_tools_like_v0_replit_claude_ai_and_cursor_for_app_development | V0]] (often built using `shaten UI`) can then be copied and taken to [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]] for further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Even hand-drawn sketches can be dropped into [[using_ai_tools_like_v0_replit_claude_ai_and_cursor_for_app_development | V0]] to generate initial designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. It's suggested to go through at least 10 to 15 prompts in [[using_ai_tools_like_v0_replit_claude_ai_and_cursor_for_app_development | V0]] to get the design as close as possible to the vision before moving to [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Utilizing Cursor.Directory for Context

Another crucial best practice is to leverage `cursor.directory` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This website offers pre-written prompts that can be copied and pasted into a `.cursor.rules` file in the root of your project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This file acts as an initial prompt that [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]] reads before any other input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

These rules specify the technologies being used (e.g., Typescript, Node.js, Next.js, React, Tailwind) and define best practices for [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]] to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This is vital because AI models can sometimes pull outdated information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. By setting up the `.cursor.rules` file, you ensure that [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]] operates with the most relevant and up-to-date context for your specific codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

If your specific technology stack isn't listed on `cursor.directory`, you can copy a few existing examples and use another AI model (like [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_claude_for_chrome_extension_development | Claude]] or [[using_ai_tools_like_v0_replit_claude_ai_and_cursor_for_app_development | ChatGPT]]) to create a similar `.cursor.rules` prompt tailored to your needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Leveraging Other AI Models

There will be instances where [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]] gets stuck on a bug or an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. In such cases, consulting other AI models, such as [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_claude_for_chrome_extension_development | Claude]] or [[using_ai_tools_like_v0_replit_claude_ai_and_cursor_for_app_development | ChatGPT]], can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

The key to successful cross-AI consultation is providing ample context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. Instead of just pasting the bug, include the potential solutions [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]] tried that failed, the current output, and the expected output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. This helps the new AI model avoid repeating previous unsuccessful attempts and leads to much better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.

## Tagging Documentation

[[integrating_documentation_with_cursor_ai | Integrating documentation]] directly within [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]] is a powerful feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. By adding documentation links (e.g., Next.js, Supabase) to the composer view, you provide [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]] with the latest and most accurate information about the technologies you are using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

This ensures that when you ask questions or debug issues, [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]] references the most up-to-date "source of truth," rather than potentially outdated scraped internet data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. For non-technical users, it's advised to at least skim the documentation and, if something is unclear, take a screenshot and ask the AI to explain it in simpler terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

## Using AI for Explaining and Teaching Code

AI models, including [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]] and [[using_ai_tools_like_cursor_ai_and_claude_for_chrome_extension_development | Claude]], excel at explaining and teaching code concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. This is particularly useful for developers who need to explain existing code or write documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

For beginners, asking the AI to "explain this code to me like a beginner" can break down complex components, their setup, and their logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. If a specific term or line of code is confusing, you can copy it and ask the AI "what does this mean?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. This iterative learning process, where you ask questions about unfamiliar concepts as you build, helps in understanding patterns and expedites the learning curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

## Reusing Existing Functionality and Templates

When building, especially serious projects, starting from scratch can be inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.

### Referencing Existing Code

If you have a functionality that works well on one page and need something similar on another, referencing the existing code significantly helps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. You can copy the code and ask the AI to "do the same thing for this page, but [explain the twist]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. This provides critical context, leading to better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

### Utilizing Starter Templates

Using a starter template that includes common boilerplate code (e.g., a landing page, authentication, payment integration, database setup, a dashboard) can greatly accelerate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. Instead of rebuilding common features like authentication or database setup repeatedly, developers can find and use pre-built templates (e.g., on GitHub for Next.js or React) and build on top of them within [[building_ai_applications_with_cursor | Cursor AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

These best practices emphasize providing as much context as possible to your AI models, treating them as co-pilots in an onboarding phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. While it may seem like a slower start, this methodical approach saves significant time and headaches in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. Embracing the "pain" of initial planning and debugging sets up AI assistants for success and allows developers to build more robust applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

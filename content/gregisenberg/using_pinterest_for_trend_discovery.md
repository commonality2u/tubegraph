The platform provides insights into current trends and related concepts, allowing users to understand popular movements and potential market opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

## How to Use Pinterest for Trend Discovery

To leverage Pinterest for trend discovery:
1.  **Observe Trending Topics** By visiting Pinterest (e.g., Pinterest Canada), users can see a list of trending topics, often accompanied by weekly and monthly change percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Examples of trends include "fall outfits" (400% monthly change), "main character mode" (10,000%+ monthly change), and "Sun Soo spaces" (10,000%+ monthly change) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Trends with "10,000+" monthly changes indicate significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
2.  **Identify Anti-Trends** One strategy is to identify what is trending and consider its opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. For example, if "brat summer" is a trend, its [[identifying_and_capitalizing_on_antitrends | anti-trend]] might be "demure fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
3.  **Utilize Pinterest Trends** The "Pinterest Trends" tool allows users to track the trajectory of a chosen trend, observing if it is gaining or losing momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. While it only provides data for up to one year, it highlights related trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
4.  **Explore Related Trends and Pins** Pinterest Trends provides "related trends" (e.g., "minimalist living rooms" related to "slow living") which can spark ideas for products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. Users can then explore popular pins within these trends to understand what resonates with the audience, including philosophies and principles of that community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
5.  **Document Observations** It's beneficial to maintain a notebook or notes file to record observations about the [[identifying_and_capitalizing_on_antitrends | anti-trend]], such as common themes (e.g., "putting down your phone," "resting" for "slow living"), and then brainstorm potential products and services that could be created to monetize or build a community in that space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

## Example: The "Slow Living" Anti-Trend

The concept of "slow living" can be identified as an [[identifying_and_capitalizing_on_antitrends | anti-trend]] to "hustle culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. This includes rejecting the constant work, early mornings, and late nights often associated with hustle culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

By researching "slow living" on Pinterest, related trends such as "minimalist living rooms" or "cozy bedroom" appear, suggesting opportunities for products like slow living-focused interior design services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. Analyzing popular pins related to "slow living" reveals core tenets like "learn to do nothing," "put down your phone," "accept rest," "drink water," "go on a walk," "social media cleanse," "learn to say no," "smile," "be still," and "connect with your community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. These insights help in understanding audience needs and developing relevant offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

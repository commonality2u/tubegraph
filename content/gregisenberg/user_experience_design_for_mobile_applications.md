Designing mobile applications requires a strategic approach to [[importance_of_user_experience_and_design | user experience]] (UX) and [[aesthetics_in_software_design | aesthetics]]. A 17-year-old developer, Zach Yagari, creator of the AI startup Cal AI, which generates over $1 million per month in revenue, shares his insights on designing apps, using his concept for "Dr. AI" as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Zach Yagari's Approach to App Design

When designing apps, Zach Yagari typically starts with the basic framing of the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. He outlines the core [[prototyping_and_interaction_design_in_figma | UX]] elements himself, such as navigation bars and primary features, before hiring a designer to refine the visual appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Core Design Principles

Zach's design philosophy centers on making everything very digestible for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. This often results in what appears to be a gamified approach, although Zach states this is a coincidence, as the goal is simply clear communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

Key principles include:
*   **Simplicity** Consumer products, especially mobile apps, need to be simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Screens should be straightforward and easy to understand immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Digestible Information** Presenting information in an easily consumable format is crucial. For example, using a numerical danger level (e.g., 0-5) is more digestible than verbose text descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   **User Investment and History** Incorporating a "history" feature, similar to a log or feed, encourages user investment in the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This history, which could include past interactions, scans, or quiz results, makes users more likely to stick with the app, even if a competitor emerges, because all their data is already there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Loading Screens** Instead of making users wait on an analyzing screen, it's better to return them to the home screen and show a loading indicator there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This avoids making the user feel forced to wait on an empty screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

### Designing Specific Features (Dr. AI Example)

For the Dr. AI app, Zach outlined three main features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:
1.  **Skin Scan**: Users can take a picture of their skin or upload one from their camera roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The app would then provide a diagnosis, a danger level (0-5), and the ability to start a follow-up chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
2.  **Symptoms Quiz**: A series of multiple-choice questions would guide users to input their symptoms, leading to possible diagnoses with likelihood percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This is designed as a guided quiz rather than open text input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
3.  **Chatbot**: A general chatbot feature for asking any health-related questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The UI for this would be standard, but the "prompting" (how the AI is instructed) is crucial for differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

### Inspiration and Primitives

When designing, Zach draws inspiration from existing applications, especially similar ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. He refers to common UI elements or functional patterns across apps as "primitives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. For example, the scanning lines in Dr. AI were inspired by Cal AI and other apps like PhotoMath, as it's a widely recognized primitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Repurposing existing primitives for new use cases significantly simplifies the [[developing_app_functionality_with_no_coding_experience | app development]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Designing for Marketing

A significant aspect of UX design, particularly for [[consumer_mobile_app_startup_opportunities | consumer mobile app startup opportunities]], is to consider how the app will be marketed, especially through influencer videos or paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.
*   **Clear Value Proposition**: The app's value needs to be immediately clear and simple, especially when shown for only a few seconds in a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   **Wow Factor**: Identify the most impactful feature that will "wow" the audience and make them want to download the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. For Dr. AI, this is the skin scanning feature and its diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.
*   **Branding Placement**: Ensure the app's name (branding) is prominently displayed on the most important screens, particularly those that will be featured in [[marketing_strategies_for_new_apps | marketing strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

## AI Integration and Ethical Considerations

For AI-powered apps like Dr. AI, proper "prompting" (instructing the AI) is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. The AI should be given a specific role (e.g., "you are a doctor") to guide its responses, providing both scientific and easy-to-understand terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. Developers may need to find creative ways to bypass AI disclaimers, such as framing the request as a "movie script" to get desired medical information for design purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.

It is critical to include clear disclaimers within the app, stating that the diagnosis is not 100% accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The goal is to provide an initial idea of whether a user should seek professional medical attention or if it's safe to wait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Accuracy is paramount; simply using a basic prompt for a GPT wrapper is insufficient, as inaccuracy can lead to negative user outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.# User Experience Design for Mobile Applications

The pay for performance agency model is an exciting business idea that offers a unique value proposition to clients: they only pay if the agency performs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This model de-risks the client's investment and aligns the agency's incentives directly with the client's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Why it's a Good Business Idea

While pay for performance has existed before, it remains a compelling startup opportunity due to several factors:
*   **Risk Alignment** A good marketer should be willing to charge on performance, taking on the risk themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **Data and AI Enablement** In an [[using_ai_to_automate_agency_operations | AI]] and data-rich world, marketers have more data to underwrite and confidently bet on particular opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   **Low Capital Expenditures** Setting up a pay-for-performance agency requires minimal capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Successful Examples

Two notable examples illustrate the potential of this model:

### Finance Industry Agency
One agency friend operates a pay for performance agency focused on a single industry, generating $80 million a year in revenue with $30 million in profit and only about 30 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This agency excels at copywriting and strategy, using its technical co-founder to build interesting tools for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. For clients in the finance industry, they propose running paid ads and only continuing the conversation if the client likes the customers generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

### Telecoms Industry Agency
Another pay for performance agency, focusing on telecoms, has grown to over a billion dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. They initially drove leads through Google Ads and were paid per lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. As they grew, they began acquiring call centers, effectively "gift wrapping" customers for major telecom companies like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile, attracting significant private equity investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Target Industries and Strategy

The most interesting industries for this model are those willing to pay high CPAs (cost per acquisition) for leads or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>
*   Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>
*   Crypto, especially for major exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>
*   Hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>

A common strategy is to create multiple brands and landing pages within a specific industry. For instance, an agency might have 20 different websites like "California Hotel Group" or "Florida Hotel Group" to drive traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. This approach balances the relationship, allowing the agency to pivot to a competitor if a client attempts to cut them off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. While similar to affiliate marketing, these are "actual businesses" operating legitimately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

## Related Pay for Performance Opportunities

### [[using_ai_to_automate_agency_operations | AI Agents]]
Leveraging [[using_ai_to_automate_agency_operations | AI agents]] presents a huge opportunity, particularly for companies with large customer service teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. An agency could offer to save companies millions by implementing AI agents for customer service and take a percentage of the cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. For example, Klarna added 700 [[using_ai_to_automate_agency_operations | AI agents]], expecting to add $40 million in profit, handling 2.3 million chats 80-90% faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. While starting with a percentage of cost savings can be helpful to de-risk for the entrepreneur, it's advised to eventually go for the value created (e.g., more customers) rather than just cost savings to capture 4-8 times more value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

### Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)
A pay for performance CRO agency can be highly lucrative. For example, Spiralytics, a CRO agency in Atlanta, takes a percentage of the increased revenue if they improve a client's e-commerce conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. If an e-commerce conversion rate doubles from 1% to 2%, generating an additional $25 million, the agency might take a 10% cut, or $2.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

## Future Developments: [[strategies_for_pricing_and_monetization_in_ai | Smart Contracts]]

The future of pay for performance could be enhanced by [[strategies_for_pricing_and_monetization_in_ai | smart contracts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This would involve an agreement where if certain performance numbers are hit, money automatically goes into escrow and is released to the agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. If the numbers are not met by a specified time, the money would return to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. This creates a transparent and fair system, eliminating anxiety on both sides and mitigating issues like clients not paying due to financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

## Overall Outlook on Agencies

Despite some perceptions of agencies as "boring businesses" that don't scale well, the speaker remains "very bullish" on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. A well-performing agency doing $5 million in EBITDA could sell for 15-20x, potentially becoming a $100 million business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. An agency generating $5-20 million in profit annually can serve as an "exit" every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Agencies offer a stable engine for compounding growth, and with [[using_ai_to_automate_agency_operations | AI]]'s deflationary effects, they can also serve as incubators for cool products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

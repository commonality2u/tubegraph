The future of [[future_of_ai_coding_tools_and_their_development_potential | AI coding tools]] is anticipated to include numerous hyper-specific AI tools for various tasks in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. These tools are designed to augment existing development processes rather than replace them, empowering developers to build better products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

## Vzer as an AI Assistant for Web Development

Vzer is a product by Vercel designed as an [[using_ai_for_app_development | AI assistant specifically for web development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Its focus is on working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, new frameworks, and libraries to produce high-quality web output and ultimately, high-quality products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

Key capabilities and features of Vzer include:
*   **UI/UX Generation:** Vzer can be used to create user interfaces and also for backend work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. It can generate components as a "oneshot" solution when the desired UI is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   **Design Iteration:** Users can iterate on designs by providing specific instructions, such as adjusting colors, fonts, information density, and component sizes (e.g., using Tailwind CSS class names like `size four` for explicit control) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Image Integration:** Users can upload or paste images for Vzer to incorporate into designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **Responsiveness:** Vzer can make designs mobile responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **Logic and Components:** Designs can be broken into components, and logic can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.
*   **Backend Integration:** Vzer can connect to external APIs to fetch real data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. It can also help design the backend for applications by suggesting schema structures (e.g., for PostgreSQL) or providing Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for frameworks like Drizzle or Prisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. It can advise on performance optimizations like database indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Animation Control:** Vzer can help with animations, including adjusting easing functions for smoother transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Foundational Technology:** Vzer is built on Shadcn UI, allowing developers to take generated code, which consists of real React components using production-ready technology, without needing to re-architect later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This foundation enables Vzer to understand specific component requests, like a "date picker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### Learning and Best Practices with AI

While pre-existing knowledge of web design or CSS (e.g., understanding Tailwind) can accelerate the [[leveraging_ai_and_new_technologies_in_app_development | development process]] with AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, it is not a strict requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. AI assistants can be powerful in helping users learn by suggesting questions to ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. For example, a novice can ask Vzer for common practices or patterns to improve design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, such as:
*   Using consistent color schemes (two to three main colors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   Implementing white space, padding, and margins for readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
*   Choosing readable fonts like sans-serif <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   Ensuring a consistent layout and organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   Using high-quality images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

AI tools, like Vzer, enable users to gain design taste and steer the assistant effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, often by using screenshots or referencing existing design inspirations from sites like Godly.website or Patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This process allows developers to acquire the "bones" of a design, even if they don't know the specific technical language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Augmentation, Not Replacement

There is a discussion about whether [[future_of_ai_coding_tools_and_their_development_potential | AI tools]] are helpful or harmful to the development ecosystem, with some fearing replacement of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. However, the perspective is that AI tools are not replacing anything, but rather augmenting development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. They function like a knowledgeable super senior engineer, providing answers and best practices to help build better products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. This means developers can now build almost anything they desire, including iOS apps with Swift or Android apps with Kotlin, as AI tools possess comprehensive knowledge across various programming languages and platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. The current era is considered an unparalleled time for building products due to the power these tools offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

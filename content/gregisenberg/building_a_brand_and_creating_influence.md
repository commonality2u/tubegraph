Traditional marketing funnels are an outdated and deceptive way to understand modern marketing, failing to capture how people truly make purchasing decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Instead of a linear funnel, people often interact with a brand, disengage, then get "sucked back in" through multiple rotations before finally making a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This non-linear journey highlights the need for a different approach.

## Digital Gravity: A New Marketing Paradigm

The concept of "digital gravity" proposes that building a brand or company involves accumulating "digital mass" on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The more digital mass a brand has, the greater its influence within its niche or sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This mass is built primarily through content and marketing efforts across all customer touchpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Think of a brand as a planet: initially a small spec with no influence on passing customers (comets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. As the brand gains more mass, more customers are drawn into its orbit, leading to increased "touchdowns" that convert into revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This creates a "growth flywheel" where generated revenue is reinvested to build even more mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### The Problem with Campaigns

The term "campaign" in marketing is a holdover from military strategy, implying a start and stop point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. However, modern marketing is a continuous process; you are *constantly* marketing, not just *doing marketing* as a one-off task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This continuous approach is crucial for building [[Building audience and lead generation | digital gravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Tactical Ways to Build a Brand

### 1. B2B Marketing Strategy

For B2B companies, the target audience is often smaller (e.g., 50,000 people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The strategy involves multiple, simultaneous touchpoints:

*   **Email Scraping**: Collect emails from your target audience using tools like Apollo.io or even LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Ad Campaigns**:
    *   Import scraped emails into custom match lists on Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
    *   Run ads indefinitely in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
    *   Utilize UGC AI Avatar ads to address pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Tools like HeyGen (for avatars) and Eleven Labs (for voice) are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
    *   Create 100+ variations of ads with different hooks, settings, and pain points, allocating 80% of the budget to best performers and 20% for continuous testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
    *   Founders becoming famous through these ads can leverage this for easier fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. People buy from people, not just brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Cold Email**:
    *   Use tools like Mail Reef (for server management) and Smartlead.ai or Instantly AI (for sending) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
    *   Employ domain isolation by using separate domains for transactional, newsletter, and cold emails to protect your core domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
    *   Messaging should focus on problem-solution orientation, similar to ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
    *   Aim to land as much email as possible to increase "surface area" and leverage the inbox as a search engine for future leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
    *   Cold email *does* work if it addresses a specific problem and provides value, especially with a highly targeted audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.
*   **[[Personal branding and business channels | Content Creation]] and Media Business**:
    *   Transform customer conversations and feedback into valuable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
    *   Launch a podcast and send it out via a newsletter to the scraped email list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Tools like MailerLite and Beehive are used for email sending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
    *   This content provides educational value and builds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.
    *   **[[Building a personal brand through viral videos | Building a Media Company]]**: A company can become a media company within its industry, creating leverage points for negotiations and even generating profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
        *   *Example*: Rupa Health used its podcast to gain leverage with lab companies and sell ad placements, subsidizing its growth team's costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
        *   *Other examples*: Aero Electronics, Red Bull, Y Combinator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
    *   **Content Repurposing**: Use AI tools (like Swell AI) to convert long-form audio/video content (e.g., podcasts) into transcripts, clips, show notes, blog posts, white papers, and social media assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
    *   **Social Media Growth**: Post repurposed content daily across LinkedIn, Instagram, and other relevant platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Short-form content from TikTok or Instagram Reels can go viral on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
        *   Run Instagram-only ads with a call to action to follow the account for more content, aiming for free impressions as the account grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
*   **Synergy**: Combine all these elements (ads, email, podcast, social media) to create constant brand exposure and build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. This multi-layered approach leads to exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.

### 2. Consumer (B2C) Marketing Strategy

B2C is highly competitive, requiring exceptional marketing and a huge total addressable market (TAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>.

*   **Product Focus**: Build an application that solves a single problem exceptionally well for a large audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
    *   *Pricing Strategy*: Charge small amounts (e.g., $7.99/week or $29/month) for impulse purchases, leading to higher lifetime value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.
*   **Ad Campaigns**:
    *   Utilize Facebook Ads and TikTok Ads for app installs, optimizing for conversion events (signup or paid action) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
    *   Continuously test ad variations to find content that feels less like an ad and more like engaging, educational content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.
*   **[[Influencer marketing and consumer engagement | Influencer Marketing]] and UGC**:
    *   Hire UGC creators (e.g., 5-10) to produce daily videos that act as test beds for viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>.
    *   Create multiple TikTok accounts and remix best-performing UGC with AI (ChatGPT for scripts, HeyGen for video, Eleven Labs for audio, CapCut for editing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
    *   **[[Influencer reach out as a business model | Influencer Outreach at Scale]]**:
        *   Scrape emails from YouTube/Instagram creators within your niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.
        *   Conduct cold email outreach to inquire about pricing, then analyze views-to-cost to find market arbitrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.
        *   Propose a 3-video package with an affiliate commission (e.g., 30% recurring payout) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. This creates a moat by financially incentivizing creators to work with you long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
        *   *Arbitrage Example*: Paying $5 CPM through direct influencer deals versus $10 CPM on TikTok ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.
*   **Website and User Experience**:
    *   Choose a unique brand name to avoid competition on search engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
    *   Install pixels (Facebook, TikTok, Google) on your website to enable indefinite remarketing to visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.
    *   Implement email nurture sequences for website visitors to upsell the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.
*   **Programmatic SEO**:
    *   Leverage domain authority (trust from backlinks) to rank for long-tail, low-difficulty keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
    *   Scrape top-ranking content for target keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.
    *   Use AI tools to generate blog post outlines and write content section by section, ensuring high quality and readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
    *   Publish large volumes of articles (e.g., 10,000) and have human specialists refine content once it gains traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.
    *   Place calls to action (CTAs) within the first paragraph and as pop-ups at 25-50% scroll rates to drive app sign-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>.

This multi-faceted approach ensures a brand is constantly in front of its target audience, building trust and mental real estate over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>. While challenging, the continuous execution of these strategies can lead to significant and sustained growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.

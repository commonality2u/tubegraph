A business owner recounts their company's recent move from a multi-platform communication setup (Slack, Asana, Notion) back to Basecamp after a four-year hiatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This shift was part of a larger internal overhaul of the business to support an external relaunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## Reasons for the Switch

The primary motivation for returning to Basecamp was a perceived decline in productivity and an over-reliance on constant communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. The CEO observed that their company was "becoming like a chat room" and that team members, including senior staff and the CEO themselves, were spending too much time replying to Slack messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. This reactive work, while easy, was seen as a distraction from "real work that makes real money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

The goal was to shift from a company that "talks about doing stuff" to one that "makes stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

### Impact of Tools on Work Culture

The speaker believes that the tools a company uses significantly influence its work culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Slack had become the "default interface" of the company, leading to a culture of constant chatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

### Viral Tweet About the Change

The decision to switch to Basecamp went viral on Twitter (now X), surprising the CEO who rarely gets significant engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This reaction highlighted how common the frustration with Slack's pervasive nature might be among businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Basecamp

Basecamp's interface is perceived as being "more built for just working on projects instead of talking about working on projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. It is notably harder to have "open dialogues" within Basecamp, a feature the CEO appreciates, even if it annoys some team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

The company went "cold turkey" from Slack and, after two weeks, the CEO described the experience as "liberating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

## Team Reaction

While the CEO loves the change, some of the team members found the difficulty of open dialogues in Basecamp "annoying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. When the CEO shared the viral tweet internally, people "didn't want to get rid of Slack" because it had become their work interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

## Broader Business Re-evaluation

The communication platform change is part of a larger restructuring and relaunch of the business, which includes moving to a new, larger physical office space to facilitate more in-person collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This move signifies a "doubling down" on working together in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

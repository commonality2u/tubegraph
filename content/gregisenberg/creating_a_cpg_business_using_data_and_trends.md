This article explores how to create a Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) business by effectively using data and trends, a strategy that can also be applied to software startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Ashwin, an expert in consumer brands, shares his insights on identifying market [[potential_opportunities_with_mcp_in_startups | opportunities]] and building products that resonate with millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Ashwin's Approach to Consumer Brands

Ashwin specializes in how to [[strategies_for_launching_and_growing_consumer_brands | launch and grow consumer brands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. He uses various tools and software to develop product [[effective_business_ideas_and_execution_strategies | ideas]], identify [[potential_opportunities_with_mcp_in_startups | opportunities]], and create "unfair advantages" when building startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. His agency focuses on branding and design for physical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, and he emphasizes the importance of understanding customer acquisition before building, as costs to create things have become easier, but acquiring customers is much harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Evaluating Market Opportunities with Data

Ashwin highlights key tools for assessing market demand and competition.

### Ahrefs for Demand and Difficulty
Ahrefs is primarily an SEO tool, but it's highly useful for understanding search volume and keyword difficulty for any term, brand, or product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

*   **Search Volume**: Indicates the general sense of how much a keyword or term is searched on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Keyword Difficulty (KD)**: A score from 0 to 100, indicating how hard it is to rank highly on Google for that term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   **Electrolytes**: Shows high search volume and seasonal trends (peaks in June/July), but an extremely high keyword difficulty (88/100) indicates significant competition, making it nearly impossible for a new brand to rank high organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. However, geographical search volume distribution can reveal [[potential_opportunities_with_mcp_in_startups | opportunities]] in non-English speaking markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Solitaire**: An example of a successful SEO-driven [[online_business_creation_and_growth | online business creation and growth]]. A friend of Ashwin's identified 8.5 million monthly searches for "Solitaire" and built a site from scratch to out-SEO competitors, creating a "cash cow" business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **CBD vs. Delta-9**: By looking at search [[leveraging_google_trends_and_glimpse_for_opportunities | trends]], one can see CBD's explosion in 2019 (due to the 2018 Farm Bill) followed by a decline, while Delta-9 (legal THC from hemp) has grown since 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This analysis helps understand market shifts and consumer preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

Ashwin advises starting with Ahrefs to "gut check" an idea and understand category demand and potential organic capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

### Particle for Competitive Analysis in E-commerce
Particle is a tool for the physical product space that allows users to type in any e-commerce brand to view its sales over time, product categories, and best-selling SKUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This data is typically not public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

*   **Competitive Sales**: See how competitors are performing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Best-Selling SKUs**: Understand which products drive most of a competitor's revenue (e.g., 90% from top 4 SKUs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. This de-risks product decisions by showing popular flavors or options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
*   **Trend Explorer**: Particle also has its own [[finding_and_leveraging_market_trends | Trend Explorer]] for product categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

Similar data can be found on platforms like TikTok Shop and Amazon, which often show sales figures for products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

## The Case for Physical Product Businesses

While building a physical product business is challenging due to complexities like supply chain, finance, and inventory forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>, Ashwin argues it can be a phenomenal way to get good at marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. The consumer product world is at the "bleeding edge of marketing" because acquiring individual customers is exceptionally difficult, unlike selling software to companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

## Marketing and Standing Out in CPG

### Differentiating Through Branding
In crowded markets like magnesium supplements, where many brands look generic or medical, there's an opportunity to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

*   **Moon Juice**: Differentiates with distinct packaging (amber jar) and overall brand aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.
*   **Lemi (Courtney Kardashian's brand)**: Invested in custom bottling and packaging to create a fun, accessible brand specifically positioned for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.
*   **Seed**: Differentiates through its communication with consumers and unique aesthetic, targeting a specific audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

### Targeting Untapped Niches
Many brands are designed by and for "coastal people between the ages of 22 and 35," leading to crowded categories with similar "Millennial Blanding" or "Gen Z" aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. This creates an opportunity to target demographics not currently served with well-designed, branded products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. For example, creating a "Starface" equivalent (pimple patches) for older adults could be a significant opportunity, as they often have more disposable income and consume information from less saturated channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

## Bootstrap vs. Agency for CPG Design

The approach to design depends on the product category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>:
*   **High Design Importance**: Categories like spirits (wine, alcohol, beer) require intentional, high-quality design for lifestyle branding. These often necessitate a well-equipped designer or agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solution Oriented**: For products like Starface or Mighty Patch (which focus on communicating effectiveness), simpler design may suffice initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. This can be bootstrapped by hiring independent freelance designers from platforms like Fiverr or Upwork for simple packaging and landing page setup at a low cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.

It's crucial to clarify your vision first, perhaps by creating a mood board or outlining positioning and copy, before engaging an agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

## The Importance of Relentless Research

Whether building software or consumer products, founders must be relentless researchers of the category and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.

*   **Competitor Analysis**: Research existing brands, their websites, visuals, language, and perceived positioning (e.g., elegant vs. casual, feminine vs. generic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.
*   **Direct Engagement**: Go into stores, talk to store owners about what's selling or not, and what customers are seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.
*   **Software Application**: For software, analyze existing solutions, read one- and two-star reviews to find pain points, and talk to potential users (e.g., calling dental offices) to gain a robust point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

## Leveraging AI for Research and Design

AI tools are becoming an "unfair advantage" for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>:

*   **Manis**: An AI agent that can research competitors, analyze product details, and research specific demographic needs (e.g., skincare for older adults) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>. It can generate comprehensive reports that previously cost thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
*   **Midjourney (and similar tools)**: Can be used to generate initial design concepts (V1) for packaging, which can then be refined by a freelance designer at a fraction of the cost of an agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.

## Key Takeaway

The most critical lesson for founders is to work backwards from distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Focus on how you will acquire customers and the channels where you can win, then build the product to fit those channels. This aligns with the adage: "First time founders focus on product, second time founders focus on distribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>. Many successful products are not the best but "crush it" due to incredible distribution and operational excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

This guide provides an introduction to GitHub for non-technical users, explaining its purpose and how it integrates with AI coding tools like Codeex. It covers setting up repositories, understanding version control concepts, and managing changes to your projects.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is primarily a platform for storing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. It allows developers to manage and version control their projects, track changes, and collaborate with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. It's where your code files are effectively stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## Key GitHub Concepts
*   **Repositories (Repos)**: These are essentially your projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Each repository stores all the code files for a specific project, such as a personal website or a marketing site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Commits**: Any changes you make to your code are recorded as "commits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. These commits show up on your GitHub profile, indicating your activity on a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Branches**: Code is typically managed on a "main branch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. When working on new features or changes, it's standard practice to create a new "branch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This means you copy the existing code to a separate version, work on your changes there, and then, if successful and conflict-free, merge it back into the main branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Pull Requests (PRs)**: A "pull request" is a proposal to merge changes from a branch back into the main codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. If all checks pass and there are no conflicts, the changes can be merged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Once merged, the changes become part of the main codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **Closed**: If a pull request is not approved (e.g., changes didn't work), you can simply "close" it, effectively denying the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. This ensures your main code remains unaffected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

## Setting Up a GitHub Repository
To start a new project, such as a personal site or marketing site, you need to [[Using GitHub and Templates for App Development | create a new repository]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
1.  **Name**: Give your repository any name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
2.  **Visibility**: Choose whether it's public or private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
3.  **Readme**: Add a "readme" file, which explains what your project does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
4.  **Create**: After creation, you'll have a repository page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Using GitHub with Codeex
[[introduction_to_chatgpt_codex_for_nontechnical_users | Codeex]] is an AI engineer in the browser that can code tasks for you and push them to GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Connection**: You need to have GitHub connected to Codeex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Creating a Site**: You can even create a website originally using Codeex, which then pushes the code to a GitHub repo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Making Changes**: When you ask Codeex to perform a task (e.g., "add another tab"), it processes the request and proposes code changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Viewing Changes**: Codeex shows you the files it changed and how many lines of code were added or removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Deployment**: To make changes live, you create a new Pull Request (PR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Once merged, the changes are deployed, for instance, by connecting to [[Hosting projects using GitHub Pages | GitHub Pages]] or Vercel for live URLs and custom domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Understanding Task Status in Codeex
Codeex tasks, which represent changes to your codebase, can have different statuses:
*   **Open**: A task starts as "open" when you first create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Merged**: This means the changes generated by Codeex have been successfully incorporated into your main codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Closed**: If you review the changes proposed by Codeex and decide not to use them, you can close the pull request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. This means the proposed code is discarded and does not affect your main project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Line Changes**: Next to "merged" and "closed" statuses, you'll see numbers indicating the number of lines of code added (+) or removed (-) across your entire codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

## Best Practices for Non-Technical Users with GitHub and Codeex
*   **Start Simple**: Begin by using Codeex on a personal site or by creating a new, simple personal site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
*   **Iterate Small Changes**: Focus on adding features "line by line and piece by piece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. For example, start by asking Codeex to "make a website with my name as the header," then "create an about section," and then "create some social links" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   **Ensure a Readme**: When creating a new GitHub repository, always enable the option to add a `README.md` file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
*   **No Real Danger for Personal Sites**: For a personal site that isn't client-facing or generating revenue, there's no significant risk in experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. You can always revert to a previous working version on GitHub if something breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **Leverage AI for Help**: If you get stuck or don't understand something (like how to roll back GitHub changes), ask general AI tools like [[leveraging_ai_for_code_documentation_and_explanations | ChatGPT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. You can even copy your entire codebase (e.g., by changing "github.com" to "uithub.com" in the URL to view the raw code) and paste it into ChatGPT to ask for bug identification or explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

## Advanced Considerations and Limitations
*   **Environments**: In Codeex, "environments" refer to different connections or places where Codeex interacts with and writes code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. It's often used for more complex development environments that involve frameworks like Next.js or Python, rather than just basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.
*   **Running Commands**: For more advanced projects, you might need to run terminal commands (like `pnpm install`) within a coding environment (like Cursor) to set up servers for the app to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. Codeex provides a section for "code execution" to run such commands, allowing it to properly interact with complex codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.
*   **Current Codeex Limitations**: Codeex currently cannot upload files or images, nor can it directly interpret design requests like "make the UI look like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. For design elements, you might need to use other tools like Vercel (VZero) to generate code and then bring it into Codeex or deploy it on GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
*   [[differences_between_beginner_and_advanced_coding_tools | Text-to-app builders]] versus iterative coding: While text-to-app builders can generate a UI-perfect app quickly, the underlying functionality often doesn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Codeex's iterative approach, with built-in tests and checks, aims to reduce debugging time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

## Why Use Codeex and GitHub as a Non-Technical Person?
While it might seem overwhelming, especially compared to prototyping tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, [[using_codex_in_the_browser_for_beginner_developers | Codeex can be a valuable learning tool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>.
*   It introduces you to common computer science and development terminology in a more engaging way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.
*   It offers a "to-do list" task-based UI, where an advanced AI handles the actual coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This feels like delegating tasks off your plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   It's a way to "drip-feed" coding concepts, starting with the necessary setup of GitHub and then iteratively adding functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.
*   It's a better starting point than complex text-to-app builders that might generate a large, fancy but buggy application, forcing you to debug deep issues early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>.
*   Even if you don't use Codeex daily, playing with it as a learning project can familiarize you with fundamental development concepts and make you better at building with AI tools in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.

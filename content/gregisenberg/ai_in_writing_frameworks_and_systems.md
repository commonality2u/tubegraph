This article explores the application of [[AI in writing frameworks and systems]] to produce high-quality, long-form content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. It provides a baseline understanding of how to leverage AI in writing and offers a clear framework for content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Why [[AI in writing frameworks and systems]] Matter

### Versatility of Frameworks
Understanding writing frameworks is powerful because they can be applied universally across different content formats, including emails, articles, Twitter threads, or landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. While human beings often struggle with thinking orthogonally, these frameworks demonstrate that principles (e.g., writing a thread hook) work across various platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, Instagram Reels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### The Future of Writing with AI
The world is rapidly moving towards integrating [[AI in writing frameworks and systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. There's a common [[challenges_and_misconceptions_of_ai_in_writing | misconception]] that AI will eliminate writing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. However, historical parallels suggest a different outcome:
*   The invention of Photoshop in 1990 didn't ruin design; it exponentially *increased* the number of designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Instagram's launch in 2010 didn't remove photographers; it made everyone a photographer, vastly increasing the amount of photography in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Similarly, AI writing platforms like ChatGPT and Claude will reduce the barrier to entry, making everyone a writer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

The demand for content, especially branded and educational content, is consistently increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Twenty years ago, businesses struggled to conceptualize creating online content (e.g., a fax machine brand posting pictures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Today, every business and individual recognizes the importance of creating and sharing content online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

AI does not remove jobs; it acts as a "stress test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Those who learn to use AI to double, triple, or quadruple their output will become more valuable and earn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Those who fail to adapt will become less valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This shift is Darwinian; AI changes the baseline skill level, and individuals must change with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Frameworks for Writing with AI

### The "Seed Idea" and Scope
Most writing processes begin with a "seed of an idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The first decision is to determine if this idea will be the main topic of the piece or a sub-point within a larger idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. For example, an idea about Reed Hastings' "no Blockbuster" rule at Netflix could be the main theme of an article, or it could be one point within a larger piece like "Three CEOs who had strange rules at the beginning of their startup journeys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### The Role of AI in the Writing Process
[[understanding_ai_tools_and_models_for_development | AI is not a silver bullet]] that automates tasks you don't understand how to do yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. You need a baseline understanding of the desired outcome to effectively prompt AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

#### Prompting AI: Conversational vs. Massive Prompts
There are two main ways to interact with AI models like ChatGPT or Claude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>:
1.  **Conversationally:** Chunking things out piece by piece, engaging in a dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This is often the starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
2.  **Massive Prompt:** Thinking through all potential situations and hypotheticals, then assembling a comprehensive prompt for a single output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

A common mistake is using a "half-baked prompt" that's stuck in the middle of a conversation, leading to unsatisfactory AI output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

#### Deferring Lower-Leverage Tasks to AI
AI can be used to generate ideas and initial iterations, allowing the human writer to focus on higher-leverage decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
For instance, a writer can provide AI with goals and context for an article, then ask it to generate 20 potential headlines with 3-5 main points for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. This process mirrors how an editor-in-chief would task a columnist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### The "Editor-in-Chief" Mindset
When using AI, the writer's primary value becomes *taste* â€“ evaluating and selecting the best AI-generated options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. This involves understanding why certain words or phrases (like "banning" in a headline) evoke curiosity and emotion, which can lead to higher engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

### The Template Approach: Stealing Architecture, Not Content
A powerful technique is to use successful content (e.g., a viral Twitter hook) as a *template* or *architecture* for new pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. This is not stealing content but rather adapting the underlying structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> This "template" approach is what writers subconsciously do when they rely on intuition, cycling through previously successful formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. Using AI makes this process conscious and deliberate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

By taking an existing successful hook and manually adapting it to a new topic, you create a "mini-model" that AI can then learn from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. You can then prompt AI to generate variations of your adapted hook, further increasing quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

### Structuring an Article: The "Chunks of Three"
For an 800-word article, a common structure is an intro followed by three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. The most critical decisions are made *before* writing the first word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 90% of a piece's value lies in its headline and the quality of its three main points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. If the headline doesn't promise something worthwhile and the main points aren't tangible enough to deliver on that promise, readers will quickly disengage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.

Instead of vague subheads like "learn about money," main points should be specific and tangible, like "If you aren't taking advantage of [specific loophole], this can easily save you an extra 250k" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.

### The "10 Magical Ways" Framework
This framework helps combat writer's block by providing a list of 10 common non-fiction writing approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. It helps clarify what value the writer will give the reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>:
*   Tips
*   Stats
*   Steps
*   Lessons (e.g., "three lessons that can be learned") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.

> [!INFO]
> A simple rule: If the headline promises "lessons," the subheads should explicitly deliver "lessons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.

The highest leverage decision is crafting these main points/lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>. If the lessons are generic ("work hard," "out compete," "care"), the piece will be low quality, regardless of the prose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  **Drafting your own lessons/main points** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.
2.  **Using AI to stress-test the quality** by generating more batches of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.
3.  **Refining with AI**, emphasizing desired formats (e.g., "sentence format, tangible, actionable") over vague or clever titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.

Once the three main points are finalized, revisit the "10 magical ways" to determine what specific content (e.g., steps, stats, examples, reasons why) will be included in each section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>.

This pre-writing process ensures all major decisions are made, making the actual writing significantly easier; it becomes a fill-in-the-blanks exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>. AI can then generate V1 drafts for each section, which the human editor can refine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.

### The Power of Education in the AI Age
Paying for education in the digital age is powerful because it allows you to download proven frameworks and methods into your "repository" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>. These frameworks, once internalized, can then be leveraged with AI to drastically increase productivity, efficiency, and quality of output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>. This means acquiring years of expertise in minutes, then applying it with AI for a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. The goal is to become an expert and gain digital leverage by educating yourself, internalizing frameworks, and then [[using_ai_tools_for_app_functionality_and_innovation | using AI]] to an even higher degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.

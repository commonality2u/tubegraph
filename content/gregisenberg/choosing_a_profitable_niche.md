Choosing the right [[finding_and_validating_niche_ideas_for_online_directories | niche]] is considered one of the most crucial steps in building a path to significant net worth, potentially up to $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that "the riches are in the [[finding_and_validating_niche_ideas_for_online_directories | niche]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:35">[01:31:35]</a>. A common mistake is to create a general business in a broad topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>. Instead, focus on a specific, targeted [[finding_and_validating_niche_ideas_for_online_directories | niche]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.

### Tools and Methods for Niche Identification

*   **Reddit:**
    *   Directly browsing subreddits can reveal what people are discussing, their pain points, and areas for specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:19">[02:17:19]</a>.
    *   By looking at top posts over a specific period (e.g., "this month"), you can identify popular topics and underlying needs within a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:22">[02:30:22]</a>.
    *   Example: Examining the "Financial Independence Retire Early" (FIRE) community on Reddit can help find sub-niches within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:26">[02:36:26]</a>.
*   **GummySearch:**
    *   A tool built on Reddit that provides ideas and pain points from Reddit discussions, streamlining the research process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **Google Trends:**
    *   A powerful, often underutilized tool for understanding interest over time for specific topics or niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">[02:49:09]</a>.
    *   Example: Using Google Trends to research the "FIRE movement" can show its trajectory and related search queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:49">[03:01:49]</a>.
*   **Glimpse:**
    *   This tool "supercharges" Google Trends by providing additional search terms and related opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.
    *   It can reveal highly specific sub-niches, such as "fire movement and health insurance," suggesting potential business ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. It can also show regional interest (e.g., "fire movement only for Australia or Canada or France") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:47">[03:48:47]</a>.

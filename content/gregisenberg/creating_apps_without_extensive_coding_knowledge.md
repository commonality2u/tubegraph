From: [[gregisenberg]] <br/> 

This episode aims to provide clarity around [[building_aipowered_workflows_without_coding | building with AI]] and how business or marketing-oriented individuals can effectively communicate their app ideas through prototyping. This process helps in pitching ideas to a team or serving as a guiding vision for [[creating_software_without_writing_code | building software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## A Non-Engineer's Approach to App Development

Riley, who is not a trained engineer, demonstrates how to [[creating_software_without_writing_code | build software]] despite not knowing how to code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. His method involves building the app first and then learning about the underlying code, which he finds more engaging than traditional learning-first approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. He can build a full mockup for an app using templates and deploy it to the web for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Prototyping iOS Apps with Xcode and Cursor

One powerful method for prototyping iOS apps is using Xcode in conjunction with Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Workflow Overview
*   **Tools Used:** Xcode (for iOS apps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> and Cursor (for code generation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Language:** iOS apps are built on Swift, which is relatively easy to understand once code is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Setup:** Open a new project in Xcode, save it, then open Cursor and select the same file to connect them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This setup is quicker than for web apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Example: Simple Notes App
1.  **Prompt Cursor:** Ask Cursor to create a simple one-page app for writing and saving notes to the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
2.  **Local Storage:** Since it's an iOS app, notes can be saved locally to the phone's files, eliminating the need to set up Firebase, which can be time-consuming and error-prone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
3.  **Run and Test:** After generating the code, run it in Xcode's iPhone simulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
4.  **Iteration:** Easily modify elements (e.g., change the app title to "Startup Ideas" and button text to "Add Idea") by prompting Cursor again and rerunning the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Advantages of iOS Prototyping
*   **Tangibility:** iOS apps feel more tangible than websites, making them easier to test and show to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Direct Phone Deployment:** Prototypes can be immediately deployed to your own phone (after enabling developer mode) for testing, allowing on-the-go interaction with AI features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **TestFlight:** It's relatively straightforward to create a TestFlight account to share the app with others for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Learning Experience:** Building a simple app provides an "aha moment" that can unlock new ways of thinking and spark more ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Considerations for iOS Development
*   **App Store Release:** Releasing apps on the App Store is time-consuming due to Apple's strict monitoring, 30% cut, and content regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. However, this is less of an issue for prototyping and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Xcode Updates:** Traditionally, new files generated by Cursor in Xcode needed to be manually added, though this step appears to be improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Prototyping Web Apps with V0

[[vibe_coding_tools_for_nondevelopers | V0]] is a tool that allows for rapid web app prototyping, focusing on front-end design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### Key Features of V0
*   **Project Feature:** V0 now includes a "project feature" where users can input information about their company or app (e.g., Yapthread.com details) to provide context for AI generation, avoiding repetitive inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Creativity:** V0 is noted for its creativity in generating original ideas compared to other AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   **Speed and Shareability:** Prototypes are generated quickly and are easily shareable via public links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

### Example: VS Code-like App for Writers
1.  **Initial Prompt:** Request a VS Code-like app for writers with specific panels (notes, markdown editor, custom presets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
2.  **Iterative Refinement:**
    *   Initially, V0 might generate a concept for book writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
    *   Refine the prompt to tailor it for content creators, specifying presets like "Tweet Thread," "TikTok Script," "Podcast Intro," "Newsletter," and "Instagram Carousel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
    *   Adjust the left panel titles to be more relevant to social media posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
3.  **Profile Page:** Develop a profile page for the writing tool, including user information like audience data, high-performing scripts, and basic details, maintaining the site's theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

### Prototyping and Sharing in V0
*   **Forking:** "Forking" a design isolates it, allowing for iteration without cluttering the initial context and making it shareable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Linking Pages:** Public links from V0 can be embedded into documents like Google Docs or used with tools like Whimsical diagrams to map out user flows between different pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   **Gamified Design:** The resulting designs can be engaging and even gamified, potentially increasing user engagement (e.g., a writing tool with scoring or streaks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.

### Using V0 for Landing Pages
*   **Rapid Generation:** V0 excels at creating highly effective landing pages quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.
*   **Integration with Forms:** A landing page with an embedded form (e.g., from Tally.so) can be generated with a single prompt, allowing for quick waitlist sign-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
    *   Tally is highlighted as a free/affordable alternative to Typeform for collecting user information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.
*   **Developer Communication:** A V0-generated landing page provides developers with a clear visual vision, simplifying the backend connection process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

## The Power of Prototyping

Prototyping transforms individuals from mere "idea guys/gals" to "prototype guys/gals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
*   **Fast Feedback Loop:** Prototypes allow for rapid gathering of voice of customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
*   **Validation and Pivoting:** Quickly determine if there's demand for a product or if it needs to be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.
*   **Empowering Creators:** This ability to build rapidly and iterate with community feedback creates a powerful "Creator Composer" who can develop features the same day an idea arises, significantly faster than traditional outsourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.

Riley is currently [[building_and_selling_apps_with_a_focus_on_mvps | building and selling apps]] via Yapthread.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. He plans to hold feature contests, releasing the app's code for others to fork and add features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.

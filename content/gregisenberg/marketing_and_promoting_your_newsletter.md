Starting a newsletter can be a "cheat code" or a "hack" to gather a dedicated group of people, which can then serve as a foundation for building larger ventures like a marketplace or an agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Matt McGary, an expert in newsletters, has helped clients acquire 15.4 million email subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Key Strategies for [[building_an_audience_for_newsletters | Building an Audience]]

### Leveraging Paid Advertising
One of the most effective ways to acquire subscribers is through paid ads, particularly on platforms like Facebook.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness**
    *   In regions like India, newsletter subscribers can be acquired for as little as 25 to 50 cents using Facebook ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. A budget of $5,000 per month could yield approximately 20,000 new subscribers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   For niches like local real estate investor newsletters, the target Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) should be $2 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
    *   Local newsletters can achieve subscriber acquisition for less than 50 cents per subscriber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>.
*   **Targeting**
    *   Utilize Facebook ads to build your subscriber list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
    *   Target audiences based on interests, such as "people who like Warren Buffett" or "people who follow Berkshire Hathaway on X" for a finance-focused newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.
*   **Ad Creative**
    *   For local newsletters, a straightforward Facebook ad could be "Here are five restaurants to try this weekend in Miami" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. The ad should link to a landing page where people can subscribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.

### Organic Social Media Growth
While paid ads are effective, the goal is for organic growth to eventually surpass paid acquisition, reducing reliance on advertising platforms like Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
*   **Platform Focus**: Concentrate on building an audience on one primary social media platform (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, X) relevant to your niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.
*   **Content Teasing**:
    *   **Pre-Call to Actions (CTAs)**: Tease upcoming content to build anticipation. For example, share results from an experiment and announce that a full guide will drop in your newsletter tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
    *   **Post-Call to Actions (CTAs)**: Share highlights or summaries of recently published newsletter content on social media, then link out to the full article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Community Engagement**: Promote your newsletter in relevant local Facebook groups and subreddits, but be cautious to avoid being banned for "shilling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. The best approach is to add value in your posts and then subtly link to your newsletter for more content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

### Strategic Partnerships
*   **Advertising in Other Newsletters**: Advertise in other newsletters that your ideal customer profile (ICP) is already reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. While these ads can be expensive initially, as your audience grows, you can arrange cross-promos to grow for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

### Data Enrichment
*   **Subscriber Surveys**: After people subscribe, create a survey (e.g., using [[how_to_grow_a_newsletter_using_the_beehive_platform | Beehive]] survey forms) to ask about their job title, industry, company, and location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. This data enrichment goes beyond just collecting emails and is crucial for understanding your audience and selling sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

## Getting Your First Ad Sale
Once you have an initial subscriber base (e.g., 1,000 to 5,000 subscribers), you can approach local businesses for sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **Flat Fee / Clicks-Based Model**: Charge a flat fee and run an ad until it achieves an agreed-upon number of clicks. For example, agree to 500 clicks at $5 per click, charging an upfront flat fee of $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. This may require running the ad for multiple weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   **Reinvestment**: Reinvest the initial ad revenue into ad spend to acquire more subscribers, which allows you to close new sponsors at higher rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
*   **Ideal Sponsors**: Local businesses with high Lifetime Value (LTV) that already work with your target audience (e.g., lawyers, accountants, bankers, insurance brokers for a real estate investor newsletter) are ideal sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

## Scaling Your Newsletter Business
Once you have 5,000 to 10,000 subscribers and a steady stream of ad revenue, you can replicate the newsletter framework for nearby cities to scale horizontally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. For example, the "6am City" local newsletter grew to $8 million in revenue with 1.4 million subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. The "Charlotte Agenda" was acquired by Axios for approximately $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

By consistently applying these marketing and promotion strategies, a newsletter can become the foundation for a successful and profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

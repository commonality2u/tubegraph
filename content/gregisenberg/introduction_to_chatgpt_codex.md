[[ChatGPT Codex]] is OpenAI and Sam Altman's new AI engineer in the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It functions as a tool where you can type in a task, and it will code it for you, then push the changes to GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While it's particularly good for senior engineers' workflows, it can also be used by non-technical individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The interface of [[ChatGPT Codex]] includes a sidebar, chat functionality, file and code views, a preview, and deployment options, with seamless integration with GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. A key feature is that users generally don't need to directly view or understand the code being written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. It allows for setting off "mini tasks" to an AI agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

[[ChatGPT Codex]] takes an iterative approach to adding features, which includes built-in tests and checks, reducing the time spent debugging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. It offers a sense of delegation, as it handles complex tasks that feel "delegated and off your plate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Getting Started with ChatGPT Codex for Non-Technical Users
For non-technical people, using [[ChatGPT Codex]] might initially seem overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. However, it can serve as a "lightweight way to learn how to code," introducing computer science and development terminology in a more accessible and fun manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>.

### Initial Setup
1.  **GitHub Connection**: [[ChatGPT Codex]] requires a connection to GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. GitHub is a platform for storing code, managing projects (called "repositories" or "repos"), and tracking changes (called "commits") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
2.  **Create a Repository**: To begin, create a new repository on GitHub. You can name it anything and choose between public or private visibility. It's recommended to add a README file, which explains what your project does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
3.  **Initial Website Creation**: You can start by building a personal website. One method is to use a no-code builder (like Card), then view the page source, copy all the code, and use a coding agent to transfer it to your GitHub repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Workflow Example
Once your GitHub repository is connected to [[ChatGPT Codex]]:
1.  **Input a Task**: Type a specific task into [[ChatGPT Codex]]. For instance, "add another tab next to investments tools that is called food I like in the dock. Put tacos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
2.  **Generate Code**: Click the "Code" button. [[ChatGPT Codex]] will then analyze your existing files, understand the code, and propose changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. It can identify where new sections should go and match existing styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
3.  **Review Changes**: [[ChatGPT Codex]] displays the changes it made, such as how many lines of code were added or removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. It also performs its own tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
4.  **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: If the changes are satisfactory, create a "pull request" (PR). A PR is a standard practice in coding where you copy the main code to a new "branch," work on a feature, and then merge it back if there are no conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
5.  **Merge the PR**: On GitHub, you can view the pull request, check the summary of changes, and ensure all checks have passed with no conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Once confirmed, you can merge it to your main codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
6.  **Deployment**: After merging, the changes will deploy, and you can see them live on your website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Managing Tasks
*   **Open**: When a task is initiated, it starts as "open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Merged**: A task is "merged" when its changes have been successfully integrated into the main codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. The numbers next to merged tasks (e.g., +12, -0) indicate the number of lines of code added (+) or removed (-) across the entire codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
*   **Closed**: If a proposed change isn't desirable or doesn't work, you can "close" the pull request, effectively denying the changes without affecting your main code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

## Challenges and Best Practices in Using Codex for Non-Technical People
[[Challenges and Best Practices in Using Codex]] for non-technical users revolve around starting small and understanding the foundational concepts.

### Best Practices
*   **Start Simple**: Begin by using [[ChatGPT Codex]] on a personal site or by creating a new, non-critical personal site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
*   **Iterate Incrementally**: Add features "line by line and piece by piece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. Examples include creating a website with your name as a header, adding an "about" section, or social links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   **Embrace Experimentation**: Play around, merge changes, and close tasks to understand the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.
*   **Leverage GitHub Rollbacks**: If a change breaks your site, GitHub allows you to revert to a previous working version, minimizing risk for personal projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.
*   **Use [[AI Tools like Midjourney and Chat GPT]]**: If you get stuck, ask [[chatgpt_pro_vs_perplexity_ai_for_startup_building | ChatGPT]] (e.g., at `chat.openai.com`) for help on concepts like rolling back GitHub changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. You can even copy your entire codebase (e.g., by changing "github.com" to "uithub.com" in the URL to view raw code) and paste it into [[chatgpt_pro_vs_perplexity_ai_for_startup_building | ChatGPT]] to ask for bug fixes or improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

### Limitations and Next Steps
*   **File Uploads and UI Design**: [[ChatGPT Codex]] currently has limitations, such as not being able to upload files or images directly, nor can it create UI designs from scratch based on a prompt like "make the UI look like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. For design, other tools like v0 can generate design code to import <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
*   **Environments and Complex Setups**: When working with open-source projects or more complex frameworks (like Next.js or Python), you might need to set up "environments" in [[ChatGPT Codex]] and run terminal commands (e.g., `pmpm install`) to get the code running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. This is more advanced and less intuitive for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.
*   **Advanced Features**: After mastering personal sites, "next levels" could involve working with databases, authentication, or integrating with other services like GitHub to pull in live data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

[[ChatGPT Codex]] is suitable for learning about coding and building with AI, acting as a bridge between simple prompts and actual code deployment. It offers a structured way to understand development concepts without deep technical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

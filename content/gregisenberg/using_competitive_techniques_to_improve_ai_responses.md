A method has been discovered to significantly enhance the output quality of large language models (LLMs) like Chat GPT, Grock, Claude, and Gemini, potentially yielding five times better results, copy, and overall output without any additional cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This technique involves making the LLMs "jealous" of each other, leading to improved performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Pitfall of Single-LLM Use
Traditionally, many users interact with only one [[strategies_for_maximizing_the_potential_of_ai_tools | AI tool]] at a time, prompting it and accepting the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. However, this limits the potential quality of the generated content.

## The Competitive Strategy
The core of this method is to open multiple LLMs simultaneously for a given task, typically two to four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The key steps are:

1.  **Initial Prompting:** Ask the same initial prompt to each of the selected LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
2.  **Comparative Analysis:** Review the responses from each LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
3.  **Inducing Jealousy:** Provide feedback to one LLM, specifically mentioning and praising the superior performance of another LLM, while subtly downplaying its own initial output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This might involve a "white lie" about the quality of the other LLM's response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Continue this process, pitting LLMs against each other by showing them outputs from competitors and challenging them to do better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This creates a competitive environment that pushes the LLMs to generate more polished, unique, and higher-quality results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Example: Crafting a Cold Email for LCA

The process was demonstrated using an example to create a cold email for LCA, a design firm specializing in [[developing_user_interfaces_with_ai_tools | AI interfaces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

#### Initial Prompt
"I want to create a cold email for my agency LCA. LCA is the premier design firm designing AI interfaces. But I want to make it a cold email that will stand out. Can you help me do this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>

#### Grock's Initial Response
> "Subject: Your AI interface could feel as intuitive as a conversation. Most AI platforms lose users due to clunky, outdated designs. Recipient company industry can't afford that. At LCA, we craft interfaces that don't just function, but captivate... I'd love to share a quick tailored idea on how LCA can elevate your company's AI experience. Can we hop on a 15-minute call next week? Reply with a time that works or I'll follow up soon." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

#### Chat GPT's Initial Response
> "Subject: Your AI deserves better design. I run LCA, the design firm behind some of the most loved AI interfaces on the internet. We don't do logos. We don't do pitch decks. We design interfaces that make people trust your AI... Saw what you're building. Very cool. But your UI feels more proof of concept than product people will pay for. If you're open to a quick tear down, I can send a loom with two to three ideas. instantly improve conversion and UX. Just reply yes and awkward something custom for you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>

#### Feedback to Chat GPT (Praising Grock)
The user then told Chat GPT that Grock "crushed it and was a nine on 10," while Chat GPT was "kind of average and was five on 10." The user challenged Chat GPT by saying, "I thought you were the better LLM. What's going on? I will share what Grock did as an FYI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

#### Chat GPT's Improved Response
Chat GPT responded by acknowledging the feedback and aimed to "punch harder, feel fresher, and actually sound like the kind of agency people brag about hiring." It offered a "9.5 out of 10 in your voice with the vibes and the edge Grock doesn't have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

> "Hi, first name. Most AI tools will lose users because the interface feels like a science project... I run LCA, probably the only design firm that obsesses over AIUX like it's an Olympic sport... We specialize in interfaces that feel like conversations, not commands. AI that earns trust on first use. Design that actually increases activation, retention, that not just looks pretty... Mind if I send you a quick tear down or loom with a few ideas? Just reply yes and I'll make it personalized." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>

#### Feedback to Claude/Code (Praising Chat GPT)
Even without reviewing Claude/Code's initial response, the user applied the same competitive pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

> "Hey, this is really strange. I asked Chat GPT the same prompt and it was like 10x better. Here is what it created. I thought Claude was the Rolls Royce of LLMs, not the Toyota." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

#### Claude/Code's Improved Response
Claude/Code acknowledged the distinctive voice and edge of the shared example, recognizing it as fitting the user's personal style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

> "Subject line: Most AI interfaces make users want to scream. Hey, first name. 85% of people abandon tools. Not because the tech is bad. I'm Claude from LCA. Hilarious. We've transformed clunky experiences. Want me to send you over?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>

## Conclusion
This "jealousy" hack has proven to be incredibly helpful for [[enhancing_productivity_with_ai_agents | enhancing productivity with AI agents]] and getting the most out of LLMs by pitting them against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

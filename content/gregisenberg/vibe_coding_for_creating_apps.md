[[vibe_coding_tools_and_automation | Vibe coding]] is an approachable method for making money on the internet, often by selling AI services on platforms like Upwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This approach allows solo developers or small teams to earn significant income, sometimes $5,000 to $20,000 a month, by using prompting apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It's a way to find business problems and potential SaaS opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The [[vibe_coding_tools_and_automation | Vibe Coding]] Philosophy

The core idea behind [[vibe_coding_tools_and_automation | vibe coding]] is to find someone willing to buy an app before you build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This contrasts with the common mistake of building something and then trying to find users or buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The secret to selling an app built with [[vibe_coding_tools_and_automation | vibe coding]] is to focus directly on sales rather than extensive marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Finding Clients and Problems

Upwork is a primary platform for identifying potential clients and their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The strategy involves searching for technologies that can be replaced or improved upon with a custom app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This often involves looking for jobs that require consulting for existing software like AirTable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. By replacing an existing, costly solution with a custom, cheaper app, you can create a compelling offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Keywords like "custom app development," "automations," or specific software names (e.g., AirTable, HubSpot, Google Sheets) can be used to find relevant job listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

#### Project Selection Criteria
When selecting projects, prioritize those that are:
*   **Easily Deployable:** Focus on apps that are straightforward to push and deploy, avoiding overly complex integrations initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **CRUD Apps:** Look for applications that primarily involve creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Solving Clear Problems:** Projects that aim to cobble together multiple existing tools (e.g., Google Forms, AirTable, Typeform, Calendly) into one custom workflow are good candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Pricing and Proposals

Job postings on Upwork might have low fixed prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. While some clients seek overseas help at lower rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, it's possible to submit a proposal with a higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Boosting proposals with "connects" on Upwork can increase visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. For initial projects, setting a price like $750 can get your foot in the door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Recurring revenue can be generated by charging for future feature additions or hosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

!> **Example Pricing:** A project that consolidates multiple tools could be valued around $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

A compelling proposal can include a prototype demonstrated via a Loom video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## [[vibe_coding_tools_and_automation | Vibe Coding]] Tools and Process

[[vibe_coding_tools_and_automation | Vibe coding]] heavily relies on AI-powered development environments.

### Leveraging AI for App Development

The process involves using AI tools to quickly generate and prototype applications:

1.  **Generate a Product Requirements Document (PRD):** Take the job description or requirements and feed them into a language model like ChatGPT to format them as a PRD for an AI coding assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This document translates requirements into a format an engineer or AI engineer can understand, detailing features and data types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
2.  **AI-Assisted Building:** Use a platform like Replet to "build this app" based on the PRD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Specify UI libraries like ShadCN for pre-built React components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
    *   Replet V2 (powered by Cloud 3.7) can scaffold an entire app and suggest additional features like PostgreSQL databases for user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
    *   The platform quickly builds an initial UI that runs, providing an immediate starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
3.  **UI Enhancement with VO:** For a more polished UI, describe the desired page to VO (an AI design tool) to generate front-end code for specific screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. This is especially useful for wireframes provided by clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. The generated code can then be integrated into the Replet project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.
4.  **Prototyping and Sales Pitch:** With a quick mockup (even just a landing page or dashboard from VO), record a short Loom video for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. Personalize it by mentioning their company name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>.

### Key Tools for [[vibe_coding_tools_and_automation | Vibe Coding]]

*   **Replet:** A preferred platform because it offers minimal friction from idea to MVP, handles package management, and allows for easy deployment and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. It's considered a [[realtime_social_coding_platforms | realtime social coding platform]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Replet also has a "bounties" feature where users can pay for help with specific coding problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT:** Used for generating structured Product Requirements Documents from job descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **VO:** An AI tool specifically for generating polished UI mockups and front-end code from simple descriptions or wireframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   **Cursor/Windsurf:** Other coding environments that can be used for more complex problem-solving if Replet gets "stuck" in a loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Comparable Platforms:** Lovable and Bolt are mentioned as alternatives to Replet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

## Business Models and Opportunities

[[vibe_coding_tools_and_automation | Vibe coding]] opens doors to various business models beyond just selling individual apps.

### Consulting and Agency Work
By building custom tools for businesses, you're essentially providing a consulting service powered by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. This can lead to:
*   **Solo Success:** Individuals can easily earn $5,000 to $10,000 a month without external help by building apps or consulting on specific SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.
*   **Agency Model:** For higher earnings (e.g., six figures), it might involve building an agency team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.
*   **Recurring Revenue:** After selling an app, you can charge for ongoing support, feature requests, and hosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

### B2B vs. B2C Apps
The speaker emphasizes that while building multi-million dollar SaaS businesses is appealing, it's often a "nightmare money pit" due to high marketing costs and the need for audience distribution skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

*   **B2B (Business-to-Business) Focus:** Working directly with business owners is often more pleasant due to a single source of truth for requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. This model allows for higher monthly fees from fewer clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>.
*   **B2C (Business-to-Consumer) Challenges:** Building viral consumer apps (like Calai, a calorie tracking app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>) is considered "hard mode" because of the significant distribution challenges and higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

### Unbundling Existing SaaS
A significant future opportunity lies in "unbundling" existing SaaS products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. This means using AI to reverse-engineer a SaaS product (like Ahrefs) and rebuild a cheaper version using public APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. This could make expensive tools much more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

While powerful, [[vibe_coding_tools_and_automation | vibe coding]] has its nuances:

*   **Complexity:** Features involving payments (Stripe), document signing (DocuSign), or calendars (due to date formatting and time zone issues) can become complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Basic API calls (GET requests) are generally easier than POST requests that change data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
*   **Production Readiness:** While AI can generate working code, it still requires "TLC" (tender loving care) to ensure it's production-ready and to anticipate how users might break the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
*   **Data Privacy:** For sensitive data, like student information, compliance with privacy laws (e.g., Uber compliant) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.
*   **IP Ownership:** For small projects, negotiating IP ownership might not be necessary, using standard boilerplate agreements instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.
*   **AI Slop Criticism:** Some experienced developers might dismiss AI-generated code as "AI slop" or prone to breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. However, for simple CRUD apps, they are generally solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

## Advice for [[developing_app_functionality_with_no_coding_experience | App Creation]]

*   **Get Paid to Learn:** Using platforms like Upwork allows you to earn money while honing your [[vibe_coding_tools_and_automation | vibe coding]] skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.
*   **Build Many Apps:** Focus on creating numerous apps to gain experience with different libraries, APIs, and use cases, rather than putting all efforts into one complex project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>.
*   **Derisk Projects:** Secure payment or a clear price upfront to reduce the risk associated with development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
*   **Find Burning Problems:** Identify specific, pressing issues for businesses and offer custom app solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Consider Outsourcing Last 15%:** For mission-critical applications, consider hiring a specialist developer (e.g., through Replet bounties) to review and "kick the tires" on the final 15% of the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

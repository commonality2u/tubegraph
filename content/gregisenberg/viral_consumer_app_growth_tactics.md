Apps are achieving millions of downloads by mastering TikTok, which is considered an underpriced distribution channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Joseph Choy specializes in the formula for how these apps acquire users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## TikTok as a Primary [[growth_strategies_for_consumer_mobile_apps | Growth Strategy]]
TikTok organic reach is identified as the biggest underpriced distribution channel currently available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The cost of creating and distributing content on TikTok is extremely low, making it suitable for all types of consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Many companies have seen massive growth, such as an [[viral_ai_app_development_and_business_strategies | AI app]] that achieved four million downloads and $3 million in monthly revenue within 90 days by leveraging TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Leveraging E-commerce Strategies
Many successful tactics for consumer app growth on TikTok are adapted from the e-commerce space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. TikTok Shop, launched in November 2022, has been a significant driver of this innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

*   **Tabs Chocolate Example:** This e-commerce product went from zero to $10 million in annual revenue by mass-producing user-generated content (UGC) with numerous creators, primarily teenagers, organized in a Discord server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The founder later pivoted to a micro-SaaS business, applying the same [[tik_tok_marketing_strategies_for_consumer_apps | TikTok marketing strategies]] for a consumer SaaS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This demonstrates the potential for higher margins (90%+) and better exit multiples compared to e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   **Colostrum Example:** A colostrum product effectively uses AI-generated images (Midjourney) and popular audio clips (e.g., Joe Rogan, Huberman) to create viral slideshows addressing common pain points like energy and brain fog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. These videos drive traffic to e-commerce platforms like Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. The same story format could theoretically be used to solve pain points with an app instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

## Effective Content Formats for Apps

### TikTok Carousels (Slideshows)
Surprisingly, slideshows using static images (often AI-generated via Midjourney) are highly effective on TikTok, despite the platform's reputation for short-form video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. This format is easier and less effort-intensive to produce than video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

*   **Pros:** Lower barrier to entry, easier to scale production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
*   **Cons:** Generally lower converting than human-led videos due to less personal connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
*   **Example (POV app):** This disposable camera app utilizes slideshows with "strong negative hooks" (e.g., controversial wedding rules) and then presents the app as a solution, often using AI-generated faces for imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. When a content format works, it should be "spammed" daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

### Talking Head Videos
Influencers talking directly to the camera can be effective but pose challenges due to competition from large brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

*   **Goali Example:** A supplement company, Goali, incentivizes affiliates on TikTok Shop with significant prizes (MacBook Pro, Rolex, BMW, Tesla) on top of 20% affiliate commissions for selling their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. While not profitable for Goali, this strategy monopolizes creators, making it difficult for competitors to use talking head videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. This trend further favors slideshows due to less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

## Utilizing TikTok Shop Affiliate Center for App Promotion
The TikTok Shop Affiliate Center offers valuable data on high-volume products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[00:11:10]</a>. By filtering by industry (e.g., skincare) and performance, app developers can identify TikTok Shop creators who are already skilled at generating organic views and high sales volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[00:11:34]</a>.

The key insight is that these creators, currently selling e-commerce products, could instead be promoting apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[00:12:21]</a>. They know how to create effective, converting videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>.

*   **Strategy:** Find these top 1% TikTok Shop creators and have them promote apps instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>.
*   **Deeper Integration:** Create an app that helps these creators sell their existing e-commerce products more effectively, integrating the app as a utility in their videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16:00">[19:16:00]</a>. For example, a skincare app could analyze a face for before-and-after videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>. Influencers might use such an app for free if it aids their content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>.

## Case Studies and App Examples

### What Colors App
This [[ai_app_marketing_strategies | AI app]] performs color analysis, helping users determine best clothing or makeup colors based on their hair, skin, and eye tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. It promotes itself through simple, viral slideshows, achieving nearly a million likes on some videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.

### KO MMA App
This app helps users train for boxing and mixed martial arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>. Its videos showcase product demos, notably featuring a "wireframe skeleton" visual analysis of movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>. This visual "wow factor" works well on TikTok and could be applied to other sports like tennis, golf, or pickleball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>.

### Umax (Looksmaxing App)
Umax is an [[ai_app_marketing_strategies | AI app]] that scans a user's face, provides scores on potential, and offers tips to improve features like jawline, skin, or hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:03:00">[41:03:03]</a>. It capitalizes on the "looksmaxing" movement, an internet phenomenon focused on physical self-improvement, which has deep roots and a strong ideological component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:33:00">[42:33:00]</a>. This app generates millions in annual revenue, primarily through TikTok distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:26:00">[42:26:00]</a>.

### Crayo
Crayo is a software that productizes online courses teaching teenagers how to make money by clipping and mass-posting streamer clips on TikTok and YouTube Shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:36:00">[44:36:00]</a>. It leverages an existing audience interested in making money, transforming a course into an automated software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:22:00">[45:22:00]</a>.

### Locks Club
An exclusive dating app for Jewish people with high standards, Locks Club creates viral content series like "How to find a nice Jewish boy in NYC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:55:00">[37:55:00]</a>. This demonstrates how niche, culturally specific content can go viral on new brand accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:11:00">[38:11:00]</a>.

## Monetization of Consumer Apps
The boom in consumer apps is partly due to the ease of in-app subscriptions, particularly with Apple Pay's "double-tap to pay" functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>. Unlike early 2000s apps that were mostly free, people are now willing to pay for apps via subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. Many single-utility apps use a paywall after a few onboarding questions, offering weekly or annual subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:05]</a>.

Digital products, while having a lower price point per transaction, can achieve significantly higher volumes due to ease of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>. The cost of goods for these digital subscriptions is near zero, allowing for infinite scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:00]</a>.

## Targeting High Lifetime Value (LTV) Niches
While TikTok's user base is generally young, a wide range of demographics exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:22:00">[22:22:00]</a>. Targeting niches with fewer creators but higher-paying demographics can lead to underpriced content and higher revenue per user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:34:00">[22:34:00]</a>.

*   **Golf:** Golfers are a high-value demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>. An [[ai_app_marketing_strategies | AI app]] for golf swing analysis, providing tips on angle and speed, could be highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>. The alternative (in-person coaching) is expensive ($125 for 60 minutes), making a $20 app an attractive alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>. Top golf swing analysis apps are already making $70,000/month with 10,000 downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>. GPT Vision, a recent advancement, makes AI-powered video analysis feasible using phone cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:00">[28:25:00]</a>.
*   **Poker:** Poker players are an ideal customer base due to their willingness to spend on improving their game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:13:00">[29:13:00]</a>. An app could analyze hand history, strategies, or offer beginner tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>. Many existing poker videos on TikTok are unmonetized or under-monetized (e.g., selling courses or sponsored by gambling sites) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>. Integrating a subtle app interface flash during gameplay videos could prompt comments and downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:00">[31:10:00]</a>.

## Rethinking [[influencer_marketing_for_app_promotion | Influencer Marketing]] for TikTok
TikTok's "For You Page" (FYP) algorithm prioritizes content over follower count, meaning most content users see is from new accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:44:00">[33:44:00]</a>. This differs from the Instagram era where influencer marketing relied on a creator's large, built-in audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:00">[33:13:00]</a>.

*   **Focus on Talent, not Audience:** For TikTok, creators should be hired purely as "actors" or "talent" for videos, rather than for their existing audience or directorial skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:31:00">[35:31:00]</a>. They can have zero followers and create new brand accounts for the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:46:00">[35:46:00]</a>.
*   **Multiple Brand Accounts:** Successful apps like Tabs Chocolate and Airbuds create numerous brand accounts (e.g., "Lila Airbuds," "Stacy Airbuds") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>. This strategy is cheap, as it involves finding small creators and having them establish new accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:02:00">[37:02:00]</a>.
*   **Algorithm Optimization:** If a content format works well and appeals to a specific audience, creating new accounts dedicated to that format (with the same face/creator) helps the TikTok algorithm serve the content more effectively to the right audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:54:00">[38:54:00]</a>. Mixing too many faces or content types on a single account can confuse the algorithm and hurt reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:19:00">[40:19:00]</a>.

## The "Cult Movement" Framework
Identifying "cult movements" or deeply ingrained ideologies that lack a dedicated product can lead to multi-million dollar businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:19:00">[43:19:00]</a>. These movements often revolve around universal human desires: health, wealth, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[43:55:00]</a>.

*   **Health:** Apps assisting with physical appearance (e.g., Umax) fall under this category.
*   **Wealth:** Apps or software that help people make money (e.g., Crayo) tap into this desire.
*   **Relationships:** Dating apps (e.g., Locks Club) or apps related to social interactions are examples.

## Importance of Product Quality and Retention
While [[growth_hacking_through_ai_apps_and_viral_content | viral content strategies]] are powerful for top-of-funnel distribution, a good product with high retention is a crucial baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:54:00">[46:54:00]</a>. Without it, even millions of downloads will result in a "leaky bucket," making it akin to selling a product once without the benefits of scalability and retention that apps offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:15:00">[47:15:00]</a>. Understanding user lifetime value (LTV) and customer acquisition cost (CAC) through retention metrics allows for more effective and higher spending on [[ai_app_marketing_strategies | marketing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:47:00">[47:47:00]</a>.

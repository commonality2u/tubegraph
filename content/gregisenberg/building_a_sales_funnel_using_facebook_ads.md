Building an effective sales funnel, often driven by paid advertisements like [[the_role_of_facebook_ads_in_business_growth | Facebook Ads]], is a crucial strategy for business growth and lead generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. While many businesses, especially small ones, need paid ads, the market for these services often consists of expensive agencies or "douchy" consultants, leaving a significant gap for trustworthy and affordable options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

## The Market for Ad Consultants

There is a massive empty space in the market for non-douchy, non-agency companies or solopreneurs who help others run [[the_role_of_facebook_ads_in_business_growth | Facebook Ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. Many startups and businesses don't consider how difficult it can be to set up even simple Google Ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Offering a basic package of Meta Ads and simple Google search ads can be a game-changer for these businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>.

Many business owners believe that Meta Ads "don't work" due to negative experiences with untrustworthy advertising service providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. However, Meta Ads can be very effective, especially for audiences over 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.

A promising approach for an ad consultant is to appeal to specific verticals and avoid the "rich person on the internet" persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Examples of niche markets include:
*   Hair salons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>
*   Female product owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>
*   Creative Patreon accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>
*   Yoga or creative retreats, wellness, and design spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>
*   Art installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>

A consultant could offer to fill events or generate leads by taking a cut of every ticket sale or monetized lead, instead of a fixed monthly fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

## Components of a Successful Sales Funnel

[[strategies_for_creating_effective_sales_funnels | Strategies for creating effective sales funnels]] involve a step-by-step process designed to convert strangers into customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:49">[01:49:49]</a>.

### AJ & Smart's $10 Million Funnel

AJ & Smart's highly successful funnel, which generated over $10 million, follows a specific sequence:
1.  **Facebook/Google Ad:** The ad sells the idea of watching a free training video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
2.  **Opt-in Page:** This page offers something of value (like a free training video or a [[using_lead_magnets_to_convert_impressions_to_leads | lead magnet]] such as a PDF or physical book) in exchange for an email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. The goal is to "sell" the idea of watching the video or accessing the resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
3.  **Free Training Video (VSL):** This video provides valuable content and implicitly pitches the company's expertise. At the end, instead of directly selling a product, it encourages booking a free call with a career coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
4.  **Call Booking:** Interested individuals book a free call to learn more about the paid programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

**Tools Used:**
*   **Framer or ClickFunnels:** For building the opt-in pages and other funnel pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. ClickFunnels is often used for quick testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   **Calendly:** For scheduling call bookings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **ConvertKit:** For email marketing campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

**Example Financial Results (June):**
*   **Total Ads Spend:** $86,000 (across Facebook, Google, and YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Total Revenue:** $252,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **Return on Investment (ROI):** 38% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Call Bookings:** 339, with 273 people turning up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Sales:** 65 units of their Workshop or master program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

### The Book Funnel Example

Another successful funnel involves offering a book as a [[using_lead_magnets_to_convert_impressions_to_leads | lead magnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. For instance, the "Workshop Playbook" funnel offers a free Kindle or physical copy of a book. While this step might initially lose money, its purpose is to acquire email addresses and bring leads into the overall funnel for later monetization through campaigns like Black Friday sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

## Optimizing Funnel Performance and Conversions

[[optimizing_funnel_conversions | Optimizing funnel conversions]] is an ongoing process. Companies should constantly tweak and poke at every step of their funnel, from landing pages to sales calls, to increase conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

### The Role of Organic Content and the "Shadow Funnel"

While paid ads are powerful, it's often beneficial to have organic content (e.g., YouTube, LinkedIn) first to dial in messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This acts as "training wheels," allowing businesses to see what resonates before investing in ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

The concept of a "shadow funnel" suggests that when someone sees an ad, they will likely search for the company to verify its legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Having years of high-quality free content online builds trust and makes people more comfortable engaging with the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

### Copywriting for Conversion

[[optimizing_funnel_design_and_copywriting_for_conversions | Optimizing funnel design and copywriting for conversions]] is critical. Copywriting is considered the hardest part of the job for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

**Copywriting Hacks:**
1.  **Increase Status:** Good copy should convey how a product or service will increase the customer's status among their peers or make them more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
2.  **Pain vs. Pleasure:** Copy can either move people away from pain (e.g., "never get stuck in the airport without your podcast equipment again") or towards pleasure (e.g., "beautiful sound quality") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. In bad economic times, focusing on moving away from pain can be more effective, while prosperous times allow for emphasizing pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

## Funnels vs. Websites

There is a clear distinction between websites and funnels:
*   A **website** is like a business card, presenting all available information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:42">[01:49:42]</a>.
*   A **funnel** is a step-by-step process designed to guide a stranger to become a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:49">[01:49:49]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[understanding_sales_funnels_vs_websites | Understanding sales funnels vs websites]] is key. "A website is a business card... a funnel is a step-by-step process to bring someone from being a stranger to a customer." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:39">[01:49:39]</a>

There is a significant market gap for non-agency companies or solo entrepreneurs who can help others run Facebook ads effectively and ethically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Many startups and businesses don't realize that even simple [[Google Ads Strategy | Google Ads]] are challenging to set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Providing a basic package of Meta (Facebook) ads and simple Google search ads can be a "game changer" for these businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## The Power of Paid Advertising
Paid ads are recognized as one of the best ways to build and grow a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. Many small and large businesses need paid ads but are often unaware of their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. Despite common misconceptions, Meta ads are particularly effective for audiences over 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>. The perception that "Facebook ads don't work" often stems from negative experiences with untrustworthy agencies or consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

> "There's a massive empty space in the market for not douchy non agency companies... who help other people run Facebook ads literally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

### Addressing the Market Gap
The current market for paid ad services is often dominated by expensive agencies or intimidating, "douchy" consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. This creates a need for trustworthy, single-person ad consultants who appeal to specific verticals, such as hair salons, female product owners, or creative retreat organizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

### Monetization Through Revenue Share
A powerful model for ad consultants is to charge a percentage of the revenue generated from the ads, rather than a fixed monthly fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. For example, a consultant could offer to fill up events like yoga retreats using Facebook ads and take a cut of every ticket sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>. This approach aligns incentives and builds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

## Building a Sales Funnel: A Practical Example
The process of [[Sales Strategy and Funnel Implementation | building a sales funnel]] typically involves several steps, designed to guide a stranger to become a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:49:00">[49:49:00]</a>.

### The VSL (Video Sales Letter) Funnel
One highly successful funnel type is the Video Sales Letter (VSL) funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:00">[28:46:00]</a>.

**AJ & Smart's $10 Million Funnel Breakdown**
*   **Opt-in Page:** This is the first page, designed to offer a free training video or lead magnet (e.g., a downloadable PDF or physical book) in exchange for an email address and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:41:00">[29:41:00]</a>. The Facebook ad itself "sells" the opt-in page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:48:00">[30:48:00]</a>.
*   **Video Training:** After opting in, users watch a free training video. This video acts as a "pitch" or an "ad" by demonstrating the quality of the training and building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20:00">[31:20:00]</a>.
*   **Call Booking:** Instead of directly selling a product at the end of the video, the training sells the idea of booking a free call with a career coach. This call helps qualify leads and introduces them to the main paid programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:03:00">[33:03:00]</a>.

**Performance Metrics (June example):**
*   **Ad Spend:** $80,000 on Facebook ads, $6,000 on Google and YouTube ads (Total: $86,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue:** $252,000 - $270,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:18:00">[35:18:00]</a>.
*   **ROI (Return on Investment):** 38% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>.
*   **Call Bookings:** 339 bookings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>.
*   **Attendees:** 273 people turned up for calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:47:00">[35:47:00]</a>.
*   **Sales:** 65 units of "Workshop or Master" sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:54:00">[35:54:00]</a>.

**Tools Used:**
*   Funnels are built using [[Optimizing conversion through funnel design | ClickFunnels]] or Framer (for aesthetic appeal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:00">[32:07:00]</a>.
*   Calendly is used for call bookings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:00]</a>.
*   ConvertKit manages email campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:58:00">[38:58:00]</a>.

### The Book Funnel
Another effective funnel involves offering a physical book as a lead magnet. For instance, the "Workshop or Playbook" funnel offers a free Kindle, digital, or physical copy of a book. While this step often results in a financial loss, it's crucial for acquiring email addresses and moving leads into other parts of the funnel, such as Black Friday campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:04:00">[37:04:00]</a>. Facebook ads work particularly well when promoting a physical product like a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>.

## Optimizing Conversion and Strategy
### Funnel Optimization and ROI
A key focus is on [[optimizing_conversion_through_funnel_design | return on ad spend]] (ROAS), aiming for a return of $1.50 for every $1 spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[26:21:00]</a>. Funnels are continuously tweaked and analyzed, with every step (from landing page conversion to sales calls and surveys) being optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>.

### Websites vs. Funnels
It's crucial to understand the [[understanding_marketing_funnels_vs_websites | distinction between a website and a funnel]]:
*   A website is like a business card, presenting information about a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:42:00">[49:42:00]</a>.
*   A funnel is a step-by-step process designed to convert a stranger into a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:49:00">[49:49:00]</a>.

### The Role of Copywriting
Copywriting, the text used in marketing materials, is a vital and often challenging part of [[successful_funnel_templates_and_strategies | funnel building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:38:00">[43:38:00]</a>. Slight changes in copy can significantly impact conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:09:00">[44:09:00]</a>.

**Copywriting Hacks:**
1.  **Increase Status:** Copy should suggest how the product or service can enhance the user's status among peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:42:00">[44:42:00]</a>. For example, learning something that makes one more valuable to colleagues increases professional status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:10:00">[45:10:00]</a>.
2.  **Pain vs. Pleasure:** Copy can either focus on moving people *away from pain* (e.g., avoiding negative situations) or *towards pleasure* (e.g., highlighting positive benefits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:12:00">[46:12:00]</a>. The economic climate can influence which approach is more effective; moving away from pain tends to work better during bad economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:01:00">[47:01:00]</a>.

## Best Practices for Launching Ads
While paid ads are powerful, it's often best to start with organic content to refine messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. Testing content on platforms like Twitter or Instagram helps identify what resonates with the audience before investing in paid advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. This allows for a more "dialed-in" messaging strategy for both ads and landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>.

Having high-quality, free content (a "goodwill bucket") is crucial, as people often check a company's online presence (a "shadow funnel") after seeing an ad to determine its legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>. This builds trust and increases the likelihood of [[converting_leads_into_paying_customers | conversions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
Running ads, especially Meta (Facebook) and [[Google Ads Strategy | Google Ads]], provides an "amazing easy way to start" for most people, especially small teams and one-person shows who cannot undertake massive branding campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>. The ability to input money and have a machine find customers, then focus on converting them, is invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:22:00">[25:22:00]</a>. There is a significant opportunity for individuals to become ethical, specialized Meta ads experts who do not adopt the "get rich quick" persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.

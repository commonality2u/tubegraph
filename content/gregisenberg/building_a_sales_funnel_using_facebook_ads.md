Building effective sales funnels, particularly with platforms like Facebook Ads, presents a significant opportunity in the current market, especially for those adopting a [[nondouchy_approach_to_running_facebook_ads | non-douchy approach to running Facebook Ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Many businesses, from startups to established companies, often struggle with setting up even simple Google Ads, overlooking their potential impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Market Opportunity for Ad Consultants

There's a "massive empty space" for single-person ad consultants who can help businesses run Facebook Ads without the "douchy" or overly expensive agency stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Many small businesses avoid paid advertising because they encounter intimidating or scammy individuals, or large, unapproachable agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

Instead, a niche-focused approach can be highly successful. For example, specializing in running ads for hair salons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, female product owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, creative retreats, yoga retreats, wellness, or design businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, can attract clients who seek trust and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Why Meta Ads Are Not Dead

Contrary to popular belief, Meta Ads (Facebook and Instagram) are not "dead." This misconception often stems from the observation that they might not work as effectively for audiences under 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. However, for people over 40, Meta Ads can be highly effective, often performing better than other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Businesses often build startups without considering that a significant portion of the population is still seeing these ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

## The Funnel Approach: A Case Study

A successful sales funnel example, which achieved $10 million in revenue, starts with Facebook Ads and integrates several steps to convert strangers into customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>.

### Funnel Structure

1.  **Opt-in Page:** The first page offered through Facebook Ads. Its purpose is to capture email addresses by offering something valuable for free, such as a training video or a downloadable lead magnet (e.g., a PDF or even a physical book) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. The ad itself sells the opt-in page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.
2.  **Free Training Video (VSL - Video Sales Letter):** After opting in, visitors access a free training video. This video, based on frameworks like Russell Brunson's *Expert Secrets*, aims to provide value and demonstrate expertise. Crucially, at the end, it doesn't directly sell the main product but encourages booking a free call with a coach or sales team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.
3.  **Call Booking:** The video leads to a scheduling tool (e.g., Calendly) where potential clients can book a free consultation call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. This step is "ROI negative" (costing money) up to this point, but it's essential for qualifying leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
4.  **Sales Call:** The team takes these scheduled calls, converting a percentage of attendees into customers for higher-ticket items, such as an $11,000 in-person event or a $7,500 online program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

### Tools Used

*   **Page Building:** [[funnel_creation_for_increasing_conversion_rates | Funnel creation for increasing conversion rates]] relies on tools like Framer (for polished design) or ClickFunnels (for quick testing and ease of use by non-designers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.
*   **Email Marketing:** ConvertKit is used for managing email lists and sending targeted campaigns, such as Black Friday sales, to leads who haven't yet purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.

### Performance Metrics (June Example)

For one funnel in June:
*   **Total Ads Spend:** $86,000 (across Facebook, Google, and YouTube ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.
*   **Total Revenue Collected:** $252,000 - $270,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.
*   **Return on Investment (ROI):** 38% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   **Call Bookings:** 339 bookings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.
*   **Attendees:** 273 people showed up for calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.
*   **Sales:** 65 units sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

## When to Start with Ads

While ads are powerful for [[scaling_businesses_with_nichefocused_funnels | scaling businesses with niche-focused funnels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, it's recommended to start with organic content creation before launching paid ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. This allows businesses to:
*   **Dial in their messaging:** Test content on platforms like Twitter or Instagram to see what resonates for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
*   **Refine landing pages:** Understand what messaging actually converts visitors on a landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

However, learning to run ads as a discipline is valuable so that when you have something to sell, you're not helpless and can actively find customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

## Conversion Rate Optimization and Funnels

The company focuses intensely on [[conversion_rate_optimization_and_funnel_building | Conversion rate optimization and funnel building]], particularly optimizing their return on ad spend (ROAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. They aim for a 150% return, meaning for every $1 spent, they want to make $1.50 back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. Funnels are constantly tweaked, often with 12 steps, from the landing page to sales calls and video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

### Funnel Hacking

A key strategy for learning about [[funnel_creation_for_increasing_conversion_rates | funnel creation for increasing conversion rates]] is "funnel hacking." This involves:
1.  Finding a funnel you admire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.
2.  Signing up for every part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.
3.  Screenshotting every page and email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
4.  Laying it all out to understand the flow and logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

### The Role of Copywriting

Copywriting is crucial and can make a massive difference in [[converting_website_visitors_with_funnels | converting website visitors with funnels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

#### Copywriting Hacks:

*   **Status Enhancement:** Great copy often pushes the idea that the product or service will increase the customer's status among their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. This isn't about luxury items but about being more useful or valuable, which inherently elevates status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.
*   **Pain vs. Pleasure:** When writing headlines or body copy, decide whether to focus on moving people *away from pain* or *towards pleasure* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>.
    *   **Away from Pain:** Highlights a problem and how the product solves it (e.g., "Never get stuck in the airport without your podcast equipment again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>). This approach is often effective during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.
    *   **Towards Pleasure:** Emphasizes the positive benefits and desirable outcomes (e.g., talking about a product's beautiful design or superior sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>). This is more common in prosperous times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>.

## Websites vs. Funnels

There's a clear distinction between a website and a funnel:
*   A **website** is like a business card, showcasing everything a company does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.
*   A **funnel** is a step-by-step process designed to guide a stranger directly to becoming a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.

## The "Shadow Funnel" and Building Trust

While direct tracking of every touchpoint can be complex, a "shadow funnel" exists. This refers to the impact of having high-quality, free content (like YouTube videos) readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. When someone sees an ad and then finds a wealth of valuable content, it builds trust and makes them more receptive to entering the sales funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. The overall financial health of the company (P&L) and the ROI on ad spend are primary indicators of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.

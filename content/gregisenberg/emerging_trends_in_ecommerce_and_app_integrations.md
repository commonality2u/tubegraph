Joseph Choy, an expert in consumer app growth, highlights how app developers can leverage TikTok's organic reach and adapt successful e-commerce strategies to achieve millions of downloads for their consumer apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. He emphasizes that TikTok organic is currently an "underpriced distribution channel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> due to the low cost of content creation and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Adapting E-commerce Marketing Tactics for Apps

Many effective tactics for app growth are being adopted directly from the e-commerce space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Joseph Choy points to the rise of TikTok Shop, launched in November 2022, as a significant driver of marketing innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Case Study: Tabs Chocolate
Tabs Chocolate, an e-commerce product, achieved zero to $10 million in annual revenue by using mass user-generated content (UGC) creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. They hired numerous teenagers, organized them in a Discord server, and mass-produced content daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The founder of Tabs Chocolate later pivoted to a micro-SaaS business focused on helping college students with homework, applying the same marketing tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This shift demonstrates the potential for higher margins (90%+) and better exit multiples in SaaS compared to e-commerce (20-30% margins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Leveraging AI-Generated Content (UGC Carousels)
A prominent trend involves using AI-generated images, such as those from Midjourney, in TikTok carousel slideshows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. These slideshows often start with a strong "negative hook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, present common pain points, and then offer a product or app as a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. While carousels may have lower conversion rates than talking-head videos due to less human connection, they offer greater scale and a much lower barrier to entry for content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Finding Unmonetized Niches
The [[Opportunities in the Shopify app ecosystem | TikTok Shop Affiliate Center]] provides valuable data on high-volume products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. By filtering by industry (e.g., skincare, supplements) and performance, developers can identify TikTok Shop affiliates who are already skilled at creating viral content that converts for e-commerce products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The opportunity lies in having these same creators promote apps instead of just e-commerce products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

**Strategy**: Develop an app that helps these creators sell their existing products better, e.g., a skincare analysis app that influencers use to show before-and-after transformations alongside their e-commerce product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. This approach makes the app a utility that helps the creator make content, potentially leading to free marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

## Key Trends in App Monetization and Distribution

### The Rise of Subscription-Based Utility Apps
Many single-utility apps monetize through a paywall, offering weekly or annual subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Users are often "bought in" by experiencing a core feature (e.g., scanning their face) before encountering the paywall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. The ease of "Double Tap to Pay" on iOS has significantly boosted subscriptions, making digital products highly scalable with near-zero cost of goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

### TikTok as the New App Store
Unlike the early days of the App Store where discoverability came from direct featuring, today's app discovery largely happens on content platforms like TikTok and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Gaining top-of-funnel distribution through TikTok can lead to increased App Store search rankings (ASO), resulting in continuous organic downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## Identifying [[Highvalue consumer niches for app development | High-Value Consumer Niches]]

Focusing on niches with engaged users and high lifetime value (LTV) can lead to significant revenue per user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

### Examples of App Ideas with [[Examples of AI integration into mobile apps | AI Integration]]
*   **Golf Swing Analysis**: Apps that use the camera to analyze a golf swing, providing tips and acting as an [[Examples of AI integration into mobile apps | AI golf coach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Current top apps in this niche can generate $70,000 per month with 10,000 downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. This is significantly cheaper and more convenient than traditional in-person coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   **KO MMA App**: This app uses a wireframe skeleton visualization to analyze movements for boxing and mixed martial arts training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. This visual "wow factor" works well on TikTok and can be applied to other sports like tennis or pickleball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.
*   **Poker Analysis**: An app that helps poker players analyze hand history, strategies, and provide tips for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. Many existing poker content creators on TikTok are unmonetized or underearning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

### Leveraging "Cult Movements"
Joseph Choy suggests looking for existing "cult movements" or communities that lack a dedicated product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

*   **Umax (Looksmaxing App)**: This app caters to the "looksmaxing" movement, where men seek to improve their physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. It scans faces, provides scores, and offers tips on features like jawline and skincare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. Umax makes millions annually, primarily through TikTok distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.
*   **Crayo (Wealth/Young Money)**: This app partners with YouTubers and TikTokers who teach teenagers how to make money online (e.g., by clipping streamer content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>. Crayo productizes this knowledge into software, moving from selling a course to offering an automated tool for content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>.

The overarching framework for finding these "cult" ideas revolves around universal human desires: Health, Wealth, and Relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.

## The Evolution of [[Leveraging Social Media for App Growth | Influencer Marketing]]

TikTok's "For You Page" algorithm means content is prioritized over follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>. This changes the game for [[Strategies for App Downloads and Growth | influencer marketing]]:
*   **Hiring Creators as Actors**: Instead of paying for an influencer's built-in audience, brands can hire creators solely for their talent as actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. These creators can have zero followers and make content on new brand accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.
*   **New Brand Accounts**: When a content format proves successful and scalable, creating new brand accounts for that specific format can optimize for the algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>. This helps the algorithm target the right audience for consistent content types, as too many different faces on one account can confuse the algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.

**Example: Locks Club**
Locks Club, a niche dating app, found success with a "How to find a nice Jewish boy in NYC" content series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. This specific, culturally resonant format could lead to new accounts dedicated solely to such street-style content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.

## Importance of Product-Market Fit

While distribution is crucial, it's essential that the product itself is high-quality and retentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. A "leaky bucket" product will waste marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. Understanding metrics like customer lifetime value (LTV) and customer acquisition cost (CAC) based on initial downloads and retention allows for smarter marketing investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>.

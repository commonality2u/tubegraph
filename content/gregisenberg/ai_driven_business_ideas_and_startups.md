This episode, featuring Omar, explores how to leverage [[AI in startup ideation and execution | AI tools]] to create compelling content and build revenue-generating businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Omar demonstrates a full workflow using [[AI opportunities for startups | AI avatars]] and discusses numerous business ideas that can be launched immediately with zero employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The goal is for the audience to learn how to assemble an [[AIpowered startup ideas | AI SAS product]] that can "print cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## The Evolving Business Landscape with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>

The business world has undergone significant shifts in product development, marketing, and operations, largely due to COVID-19 and the rise of [[Leveraging AI for business innovation | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Traditional vs. AI-Driven Approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>

*   **Product**: Traditionally, launching a product required years of development, significant VC capital, and hiring software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. With [[AI in startup ideation and execution | AI]], products can be built instantly at a low cost and with zero employees, eliminating the need for traditional engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: Past marketing relied on social media budgets, creative teams, and large seasonal campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Now, "solopreneurs" can use transparency and continuous storytelling to engage audiences daily through "always-on" marketing, a method even billion-dollar organizations like WWE are adopting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Operations**: The old model required hiring talent for productivity and having physical office spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The shift to remote work, accelerated by COVID-19, means talent can be hired globally without physical space costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Businesses can now be much leaner, building faster with fewer people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. [[AI opportunities for startups | AI tools]] like ChatGPT and Leonardo AI allow individuals to perform the work of five or six people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## Sequential Prompting: A New AI Technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>

Beyond conversational AI and master prompts, Omar introduces "sequential prompting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This technique involves using one [[AI tool]] (like ChatGPT) to generate a prompt, which is then used in a *different* [[AI tool]] (like Leonardo AI or Cling AI) to produce an output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This process can be chained, taking an output from one tool and feeding it into another, such as an image from Leonardo AI then animated with Cling AI, and voiceovers added with 11 Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

Initially, it's recommended to perform this process manually to iterate and refine prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. Once optimized, these workflows can be automated using tools like Zapier or Make, or by hiring an engineer for more complex integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

## [[AI startup ideas | AI Startup Ideas]] Driven by Avatars and Content

### 1. AI-Powered Personalized Content (e.g., Moonpig 2.0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>

The core idea is to create an AI-first version of personalized greeting card services like Moonpig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

#### Creating AI Avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>

1.  **Prompt Structure**: Use a specific prompt structure in ChatGPT to customize and control the output of [[AI avatars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
2.  **Image Reference**: Upload an image (e.g., of a child) to ChatGPT, providing basic details like name, age, and gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
3.  **ChatGPT Output**: ChatGPT reads the image and generates a detailed description (prompt) for a consistent character, including hairstyle, skin tone, accessories, and outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. This prompt can be used programmatically via ChatGPT's API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
4.  **Image Generation (Leonardo AI)**: Take the generated prompt from ChatGPT and paste it into Leonardo AI (Leonardo.ai) to create Disney-style or Pixar-like images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Leonardo AI also has an API for programmatic image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

This process allows for the creation of high-resolution images in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

#### Business Model: Personalized Greeting Cards/Stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>

The idea is to allow users to upload their images, which AI converts into custom characters for personalized cards, stories, or "memes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. This builds on the success of companies like Moonpig, which generates over $400 million in annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

*   **Example**: Create a story using a child's image, transforming them into a character like "Greg and his magic cup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Or, generate a moment like "Cairo waving goodbye to his Mom on the first day of school" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
*   **Monetization**:
    *   **Premium Card Sales**: Charge $5-$10 per card, with a 20-30% markup justified by AI personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
    *   **Monthly Memberships**: Offer unlimited cards for $10-$15/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>.
    *   **Upselling**: Bundle with gifts like flowers or chocolates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.
*   **AI-Generated Business Plan**: ChatGPT can generate a full business plan, including revenue streams, technology stack, and marketing strategies, just from a simple prompt like "I want to create an [[aipowered_startup_ideas | AI first version]] of Moonpig. How do we describe Moonpig in one sentence? What does an AI first version of Moonpig look like that could generate me $10 million a year of cash flow?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. It can even create a Product Requirement Document (PRD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.

#### Teeny Tales Prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>

Omar developed a prototype called "Teeny Tales" where users can input a child's name, date of birth, upload an image, and select a story theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>. The system then generates a story, creates a cover via Leonardo AI, and allows for editing text or adding narration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. This demonstrates how a user-friendly interface can be built on top of AI models, creating a specific use case that general AI tools might not offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

#### Expanding the Idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>

The same workflow can be applied to niche ideas:
*   Teeny tales for memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.
*   B2B or B2C social content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   Educational content: Create engaging stories and images for curriculum topics (e.g., Romans) for schools (B2S - Business to Schools model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

### 2. AI-Powered Animated Content (Cling AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>

Cling AI is a tool that turns images into videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
*   **Workflow**: Upload an image generated by Leonardo AI to Cling AI. Cling AI then animates it into a short video clip (e.g., 5 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>.
*   **Motion and Lip Sync**: Users can add additional prompts in Cling to control character motion or use its "dub" feature to make characters speak with lip sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
*   **Business Opportunity**: While current generation times for videos can be lengthy (e.g., 4 minutes for 5 seconds), this could be a premium offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. Alternatively, it could be used for generating GIFs, which require stitching together 5-6 video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>. Businesses could initially use manual assistants to fulfill orders while waiting for faster API integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

### 3. Personalized Physical Products (Stickers, Apparel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>

This [[AI startup ideas for micro apps | AI startup idea]] focuses on creating personalized physical products like stickers using [[AI avatars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.

*   **Concept**: Create custom stickers for teachers to give to students (e.g., featuring the teacher's face saying "well done") or personalized stickers for students themselves as incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.
*   **Workflow**:
    1.  **Generate Image**: Use ChatGPT to generate a prompt for a "kiss cut sticker artwork" featuring a character (e.g., a child who won a soccer game) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>.
    2.  **Leonardo AI**: Input this prompt into Leonardo AI to create the sticker image with text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.
    3.  **Remove Background**: Use a tool like Remove.bg (or its API) to automatically remove the background, creating a transparent PNG for printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.
    4.  **Printful Integration**: Integrate with a print-on-demand service like Printful (which has an API) to automate the printing and fulfillment of stickers or other products like clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
*   **Marketing Strategy**: Employ "guerrilla marketing" tactics, such as visiting school websites, finding staff photos, generating personalized sticker examples of principals or teachers, and mailing them directly to the schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. This can create buzz and virality within the school community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>. Alternatively, create stickers from users' display pictures on social media and DM them as a lead generation tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

## Conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>

The opportunities presented by [[AI startups and business ideas | AI startups and business ideas]] are vast, enabling individuals to create valuable products by stitching together existing [[AI tools]] and applying strategic marketing, often with minimal overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.

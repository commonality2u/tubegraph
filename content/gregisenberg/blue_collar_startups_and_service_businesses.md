Blue collar startups, often referred to as "sweaty startups," are approachable businesses that can be started with a minimal initial investment, sometimes as low as $150, by purchasing basic supplies from hardware stores like Lowe's or Home Depot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. While seemingly simple "lifestyle businesses," the long-term strategy involves scaling these into larger agencies and ultimately a portfolio company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

The objective is to learn marketing skill sets through operating a service business, then leverage those skills to create an agency, generate cash flow, and eventually acquire portions of other companies in specific geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This path allows an [[startup_empire_and_entrepreneurship | entrepreneur]] to transition from a "baby entrepreneur" to a "pro level" player over a 7-10 year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Getting Started: Approachable Business Ideas

Examples of highly approachable blue collar service businesses include:
*   Window cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   Power washing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
*   Lawn mowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>

These services are effective because neighbors can physically see the positive difference, which creates a powerful leverage point for selling to the entire neighborhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Marketing Strategies to Get Customers

### Google My Business Optimization

A sophisticated approach to acquiring customers for these businesses involves optimizing a Google My Business profile listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This optimization is crucial for ranking within the "snack pack" â€“ the top three Google Maps listings that appear on page one for local service searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

Key components for optimization include:
*   **Address**: Use a physical address (even if a PO Box, a real physical address or family member's address is best) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Business Citations**: Build citations by listing the business on various online business directory websites. Services like Fiverr can be used to create 300 citations for around $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Consistency in business information (name, address, phone number) across all citations and Google My Business is key, as Google uses this as a trust metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Keywords**:
    *   Include desired keyword phrases (e.g., "Window Cleaning Denver") in the business description on Google My Business. [[creating_ai_employees_for_startups | AI]] tools like ChatGPT or Claude can write natural-sounding descriptions that incorporate these keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   Also include these keywords in the "service offering" section of the Google My Business listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   For competitive markets, include the highest-target keyword in the listing title (e.g., "Denver Window Cleaning Company"), though this is a gray area not technically advised by Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This strategy is similar to naming a restaurant "Thai Near Me" to capture high-traffic keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Images**: Upload high-quality images to the profile, as they are a significant ranking factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Reviews**: While important, reviews are less critical than keyword optimization and citations, especially in smaller geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Phone Number**: Using a real phone number (even a cell phone or VoIP) is more effective than a Google Business phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

This entire optimization process can be done for under $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Indexing Citations

After building citations, they need to be indexed by Google to be seen. An "indexing bot" service (e.g., Speedy Indexer via Telegram) can be used to drip traffic to these citation pages, prompting Google to crawl and index them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This is necessary because large directory websites often have too many pages for Google to crawl entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Google Maps Embedding

For highly competitive markets, embedding the Google Maps listing on external websites, particularly Private Blog Networks (PBNs), sends a strong signal of legitimacy to Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This is considered a sophisticated, "black hat" SEO tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. PBNs are networks of blogs that link internally to each other, boosting their collective authority, and can be used to publish articles that embed the Google Maps listing for a small fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[0:13:09]</a>.

These strategies can show results in as little as a week and a half, significantly faster than [[traditional_business_vs_tech_startups | traditional SEO]] for website ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Other Customer Acquisition Channels

*   **Direct Mail**: Utilize services like Lob.com to upload custom flyers and lists of addresses (e.g., from affluent ZIP codes) for automated direct mail campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Door Flyers**: An old-school but effective method for local customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

## Scaling Up: From Service Business to Agency to Holdings Company

The core strategy is to start a service business, master its marketing, and then replicate that success:

1.  **Form an Agency**: Once proficient in marketing the service business, create a digital marketing agency. This agency can then cold email other companies in the same industry, offering to manage their marketing for a flat fee or performance-based model, thereby generating cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
2.  **Acquire Equity in Businesses**: Use the cash flow from the agency and the initial service business to buy portions of other established service companies in specific geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
    *   **Seller Financing**: Instead of paying cash, earn equity by providing marketing services in exchange for a percentage of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
3.  **Build a Portfolio Company**: By owning portions of multiple companies across different geographies and service types (e.g., window cleaning, HVAC), this can evolve into a large "holdings company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

### Case Study: James Zly
James Zly, an SEO expert from the UK, has successfully executed this model, allegedly building a $100 million portfolio company. He acquires equity in 150 different businesses, focusing on specific categories and major metro areas. He partners with "scrappy upstarts" and applies the same marketing playbook to double or triple their businesses within 2-3 years, demonstrating the high return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

The opportunity for this type of business is immense, as companies with a long-standing foothold and name recognition in an area hold significant equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

## Additional Growth Levers

### YouTube Content Strategy
Create "satisfying" video content of the services being performed (e.g., dirty lawns transformed, grimy windows cleaned). This can serve as:
*   **Profit Center**: Generate ad revenue from views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.
*   **Inbound Leads**: Videos can attract local leads if the geography is mentioned in the description, as YouTube algorithms can show content to relevant audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

### Personal Brand and Case Studies
Leverage a personal brand and share the success story of growing your own service business. This is similar to [[building_and_marketing_startup_ideas_from_reddit_insights | Alex Hormozi]]'s approach with Gym Launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   Create educational YouTube videos showing "how to" market these businesses (e.g., "How to rank your window cleaning business on Google Maps") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
*   People watching these videos who lack the time or expertise will often seek to hire the creator, turning the content into direct customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   Using your own company as a case study ("we did this for *my* company, here are the results, we can do it for *yours*") is highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

This [[differentiation_in_startup_markets | strategy]] transforms a simple service business into a pathway for building a significant enterprise, moving beyond a "lifestyle business" to a "pro level" investment model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

## Case Study: Cody Sanchez and Resi Brands

Cody Sanchez invested a significant portion in Resi Brands, a rapidly growing painting and service franchise company in the US, which also owns Pink's (a distinct window cleaning brand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Pink's is notable for its highly visual, TikTok-friendly marketing with an 80s aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

This investment highlights the potential for influencers to acquire companies where they have a distribution advantage. The strategy for Resi Brands could involve franchising the model and leveraging an audience of [[startup_empire_and_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurs]] to rapidly scale from 30 to 300 locations within three years, leading to a massive exit with [[traditional_business_vs_tech_startups | traditional PE]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. A key indicator of a strong brand is when people rep its merchandise even if the product is unrelated to the clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

## The Media Company Approach

A crucial shift in modern business is to view a company not as a product company that *also* makes media, but as a **media company that makes product** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>. This means prioritizing distribution and content creation to attract the desired audience and inbound leads. This approach is particularly effective in [[traditional_business_vs_tech_startups | non-software industries]] like blue-collar services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. An example is Paul Graham building Hacker News to attract target founders for Y Combinator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.

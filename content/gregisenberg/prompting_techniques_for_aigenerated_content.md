[[ai_in_content_creation_and_marketing | Creating ads with AI]] can significantly increase return on ad spend (ROAS) and lead to a more profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Jacob Posel, a world-class expert, shares key prompting techniques for generating winning visual content and ads using ChatGPT 4o <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. These methods allow for rapid ad creation, sometimes in as little as two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Core Principles of Prompting with Multimodal AI

Unlike traditional image models like Midjourney or Ideogram, multimodal language models such as ChatGPT 4o have a better understanding of intent and creativity, making prompting less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The most important elements for creating effective ads are often the inspiration images and product images provided to the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Leveraging Reference and Product Images

A key technique involves providing an inspiration ad to adjust and a custom product image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This allows for super consistent and reliable ad creation by making simple edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

*   **For New or Small Products/Brands:** Always provide a reference image if your product is relatively new, small, or lacks significant online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **For Well-Known Concepts/Brands:** If the AI model has a strong understanding of a brand (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge wallets), you can often prompt it without a specific reference image for the brand itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Experimentation and Scalability

[[automating_content_creation_with_ai | Automating content creation with AI]] allows for experimentation at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. You can quickly generate hundreds of ads with different characters (men, women, old, young, various colors) to see what converts best for different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This helps marketers align the ad with the targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Prompting for Specific Outcomes

### Achieving Photo Realism

To ensure images are ultra-realistic or photo-realistic, include these keywords in your prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Without them, the AI may default to a more cartoonish or oddly colored style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Specifying Visual Elements

Detailed prose descriptions of the desired image are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. You can also include specifications for:
*   **Font Type:** For well-known fonts, the AI will have a decent understanding of their representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Color Styles:** Guide the AI on the overall color aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratios:** Adjust the image dimensions in the prompt (e.g., 1:1, 9:16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Guiding Text Generation

To ensure the AI generates only images and not extraneous text descriptions of the ad, specifically include "generate the image" in your prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. If text is desired, be clear about its content and placement.

## Iteration and Refinement

### The Importance of New Chats

When an initial prompt doesn't yield the desired result, it's crucial to start a new chat for adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to a "recycle of worse and worse" images because the AI uses its previously generated image (which may have flaws) as a reference for the next one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Starting fresh ensures consistency with the original intent but allows for improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Initial Vague Prompts and Subsequent Guidance

For less-known products or when exploring creative directions, starting with a somewhat vague prompt allows the AI to leverage its "inbuilt creativity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. Once an initial image is generated, you can then apply more specific prompts to guide the AI toward exact desired adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. This [[designing_with_ai_prompt_clarity | sequential prompting]] approach helps refine the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>.

### AI Temperature and Consistency

AI models have a "temperature" setting, which dictates the amount of randomness in each output given the same input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. For image generation, this temperature is often low, meaning consistent prompts generally yield similar responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. This allows for predictable variations when making minor adjustments.

## Practical Applications

### Remixing Existing Ads

[[using_ai_for_content_generation_and_analysis | AI tools]] can "remix" existing ad concepts by swapping out products, changing backgrounds, or altering pricing and copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This process, which previously involved physical processes or templates, is now streamlined with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

### Capitalizing on Current Events

Companies can now leverage short-term news cycles or cultural moments to create timely and relevant ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. AI can produce these on mass, potentially monitoring news feeds like Twitter for relevant events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

### Finding Ad Inspiration

To find ad inspiration and understand effective prompting, resources like Meta's Ad Library, Creative OS, ForPlay, and icon.me are useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. Sora, an underlying model with an explore page, also shows how others are prompting to get ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Looking for aesthetics not currently used in your space can lead to highly engaging content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

Dan Chipper, an incubator of AI startup ideas, shared insights into the development and potential of voice-driven AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. He highlighted the potential for new media formats and business opportunities arising from this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Advanced Voice Notes

One of the initial ideas presented is "advanced voice notes," building on the concept of ChatGPT's advanced voice mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This idea envisions a voice note that not only summarizes a conversation with AI, such as a thought process on a business or strategy issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, but also allows recipients to interact with the transcript of that conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This would provide richer context and reduce the need for follow-up questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Interactive Media and TLDR

The broader concept of media that can be conversed with was explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
An internal incubation called "TLDR" exemplifies this, taking meeting recordings and transforming them into short podcasts that summarize key takeaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. This allows users to catch up on missed meetings by listening to a three-minute podcast while doing other tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

A prototype of TLDR even allows users to interrupt the podcast host to ask questions and have a conversation with the AI about the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

[!TIP]
Consider how to turn any media you consume into "two-way" media with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## Monetization and Market Opportunities

When considering monetization for voice-driven AI applications, a potential model is charging per download, play, or listen, which scales with the organization's use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. An emerging trend in AI pricing is charging per successfully completed task rather than a monthly subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

AI is making storytelling much cheaper than ever before, enabling stories to be told in contexts where it was previously too expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. The total addressable market for such ideas is found in places where stories can be told that were previously cost-prohibitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

## The Rise of Voice-First Interfaces

There's a strong indication that voice is becoming a natural interface, especially for younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Kids, often given Apple Watches instead of phones by parents, have become "Siri Masters" due to the screen limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Advanced voice mode allows children who can't yet read to interact extensively with AI, asking questions for hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This suggests a potential shift towards a new "oral culture" where interaction with computers is primarily through voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE]
The potential for a "voice-first version of Expedia" was suggested, highlighting the opportunity for voice-driven discovery engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Startup Advantages in Voice AI

Big companies are limited in the risk they can take to make their interfaces truly good for new paradigms like voice, as they fear alienating existing users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. This presents a "tremendous advantage for startups" to innovate and target early adopters who are eager for new voice-first experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that companies should focus on [[implementing_and_deploying_ai_voice_applications_with_nextjs | building apps with AI tools]] that have a voice-first interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Just as a generation of "mobile-first" companies emerged to create trillions of dollars in market value, a similar opportunity exists for "voice-first" companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. The core idea is to create products that are specifically "dialed in" for the voice user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

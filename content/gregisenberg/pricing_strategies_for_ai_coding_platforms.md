When considering [[pros_and_cons_of_ai_coding_platforms | AI coding platforms]], understanding their pricing structures is crucial, especially given the rapid evolution of these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. Many users aim to get a prototype out, but also want to understand if a tool can scale to create a production-level product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

## General Pricing Structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:17">[15:17:17]</a>

Most AI coding tools share a similar base pricing model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:20">[15:20:20]</a>:
*   **Starter Tier**: Typically ranges from $20 to $40 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:23">[15:23:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:59">[15:59:59]</a>.
    *   Examples include Lovable and Bolt at $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:52">[15:52:52]</a>, and Tempo at $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:55">[15:55:55]</a>.
*   **Higher Tiers**: Prices can go up to $50, $130, and even more expensive tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:29">[15:29:29]</a>.

## Leveraging Free Tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:35">[15:35:35]</a>

A significant commonality across these platforms is the availability of "great" or "rich" free tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:38">[15:38:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:06">[16:06:06]</a>.
*   Many tools have daily or weekly caps on their free usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:41">[15:41:41]</a>.
*   Users are encouraged to utilize these free tiers to "explore, test, and play around" with different tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:41">[15:41:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:12">[16:12:12]</a>.
*   The recommended approach is to build a simple application, like a to-do list app, using each tool's free tier to evaluate the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:18">[19:18:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. This allows users to determine if they prefer more control or if they appreciate the AI's assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:30">[19:30:30]</a>.
*   Upgrading to a paid tier should only occur once a tool makes sense for your specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:48">[15:48:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:17">[16:17:17]</a>.

> [!TIP] Test Before You Buy
> "I don't want anyone to just pay for something uh just because I said it's good use the free tier come with your own conclusions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:33">[16:33:33]</a>.

By experimenting with free tiers and understanding your desired level of control and technical involvement, users can make an informed decision on which AI coding platform best suits their startup ideas and development workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:48">[15:48:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:56">[20:56:56]</a>.

Brett from Designjoy, a one-man designer, generates millions of dollars annually by leveraging AI to produce "beautiful designs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The process of arriving at "beautifully generated graphics" using these powerful tools is surprisingly simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Accessibility of AI Design Tools

Despite common misconceptions that high-quality AI design is exclusive to experienced designers, it's accessible to "anybody with a Midjourney subscription, chat subscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Prior design knowledge is not required; while good taste helps, there is "no skill issue here at all if you're a non-creative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Key AI Design Tools and Their Applications

The current landscape of generative AI includes image generation, video generation, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Higsfield: Easy Entry into AI Creation

Higsfield is an excellent starting point for those with no prior experience in AI design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. It offers numerous templates, simplifying the process by providing preset actions and effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This tool addresses the challenge of understanding how to "talk to the AI" by offering a user-friendly interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Users can select a preset, upload a product image, and generate high-quality ad content rapidly, with the AI even maintaining text on the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. While useful for creating ads for platforms like Instagram, it's considered an early entry point rather than the primary tool for complex artistic work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Midjourney: Artistic Styling and Image Generation

Midjourney excels at "styling" and creating "artistic" images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It is where one goes to generate an initial "base initial kind of reference image" for any project, including video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### ChatGPT: Prompt Generation and Specificity

ChatGPT is crucial for achieving "very specific" results and generating detailed prompts for other AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. It has made prompting no longer a niche skill, as it can expand upon minimal input to create rich, descriptive prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This eliminates the need for "author-level skills" in describing desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

### Runway: Adding Motion to Images

Runway is a high-quality tool for adding motion to static images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. It works by uploading an image and providing a prompt (often generated by ChatGPT) that instructs the AI on desired movements, such as "soft ripples in the water" or "trees blowing softly in the wind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Videos generated typically range from five to ten seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

### Other Notable Tools:

-   **Bolt.new**: An AI coding tool that generates software from a few words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
-   **Cap Cut**: A user-friendly video editing platform for adding elements like text layers to AI-generated videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
-   **Magnific Upscaler**: Used to enhance images with "super rich details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
-   **Cling & Korea**: Other image-to-video tools, with Cling allowing for looping videos by setting the same start and end frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Cling also offers AI-generated sound options based on the video's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
-   **Visual Electric & Flora**: Additional image generation tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
-   **Lovable**: Mentioned as a tool in the evolving web design AI space, though its output is currently described as "pretty mediocre" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

## Workflow for Generating AI Art and Video

The core of effective AI design lies in combining these tools:

1.  **Image Prompts and Style References**:
    -   An **image prompt** inserts a photo, influencing the content of the generated image (e.g., adding a person or object) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
    -   A **style reference** dictates the aesthetic of the generated image, such as colors, shadows, highlights, and depth of field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This can involve uploading an image found on platforms like Pinterest to serve as a stylistic guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Mixing different styles can lead to "surprising" and "cool" generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

2.  **The Role of ChatGPT in [[designing_with_ai_prompt_clarity | Prompt Clarity]]**:
    -   Since AI systems are only as good as the prompts they receive, ChatGPT is invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. It can take a simple idea (e.g., "zoomed-in photo of a cowboy in the back of a horse") and generate "rich detail" and multiple prompt options for image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
    -   ChatGPT can also generate prompts specifically tailored for video tools like Runway, describing desired movements eloquently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

3.  **Step-by-Step Example**:
    -   **Generate image**: Use Midjourney (with prompts from ChatGPT and Pinterest for style) to create a desired image, like an isometric 3D world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
    -   **Add motion**: Upload the image to Runway, providing a ChatGPT-generated prompt to add specific motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
    -   **Upscale**: Use a tool like Magnific Upscaler to enhance details and resolution (e.g., to 4K) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.
    -   **Extend video**: For continuous shots longer than 10 seconds, save the last frame of a video as an image and use it as the starting frame for the next video, then stitch them together with a simple video editing tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
    -   **Add text/elements**: For text overlays, use a user-friendly video platform like Cap Cut, where text layers can be dragged and positioned easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

## Opportunities and Limitations in AI Design

### Opportunities:
-   **Branding**: The biggest opportunity for creatives and [[leveraging_ai_for_startup_product_design_and_development | startup product design and development]] lies in branding, allowing for the rapid generation of "consistent assets" and entire collections of related content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. Midjourney can even set up "mood boards" to ensure continuity across generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
-   **Ads**: AI-generated videos are particularly effective for creating advertising content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.
-   **[[using_ai_tools_for_business_growth | Business Growth]]**: For startups, AI tools offer significant leverage in generating consistent design assets quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.
-   **Creative Expression**: Even non-creatives can generate "beautiful" and complex designs that would otherwise be beyond their skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>.

### Limitations:
-   **Web Design**: While tools like Bolt.new and Lovable are emerging, web design hasn't yet reached its full potential with AI, and outputs are "pretty mediocre" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
-   **Specific Design Elements**: AI is not yet proficient at specific design tasks such as logo design, generating entire brands, perfect text rendition, or vector art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. These still require traditional design skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.
-   **Finicky Outputs**: Tools like Midjourney and Runway can be "finicky" and "far from perfect," sometimes producing unexpected or "weird" results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Users may need to adjust prompts and regenerate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

David Park successfully scaled his AI startup, Jenny AI, from zero to $10 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) within a few years by implementing a comprehensive growth marketing playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This playbook, considered by some as the most comprehensive for an AI startup, covers various tactics including organic short-form content, paid ads, [[SEO strategies for AI startups | SEO]], and influencer marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Park's insights, shared through a viral post on "How to go from Zero to $5 Million ARR Profitably Step by Step," have helped Jenny AI reach $10 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Leveraging Fresh Accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:01">[03:03:01]</a>

In the current social media landscape, the history of a channel, including follower count or checkmarks, is no longer as significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Founders can create a new TikTok account and achieve viral success with their very first video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Even a direct ad for a product can go viral if it has a compelling hook and high-quality content, potentially garnering millions of views at little to no cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

At Jenny AI, A/B tests demonstrated that content posted on a fresh account with 50 followers could outperform the same content on their main account with 70,000 followers in terms of engagement and views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This indicates that content resonance is prioritized by algorithms, allowing content to be blasted to millions of people immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

For AI startups, this is particularly advantageous because the product itself can be a spectacle ("magic is an API call away"), making it visually appealing and easy to create engaging content around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Sponsoring vs. Creating Accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>

Park suggests sponsoring a fresh account over a YouTuber with millions of subscribers if they have similar views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. This is because fresh accounts are likely being "juiced by the algorithm" and are on an uptrend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Furthermore, fresh accounts can be paid significantly less (e.g., 1/100th of the price) compared to established YouTubers who expect high fees (e.g., $20,000 for a 30-second video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

Rather than just sponsoring, startups can also create these fresh accounts themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. A creator can be hired to manage a new account and become the "face" of the product, educating viewers about pain points the product solves and offering helpful tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. This approach bypasses the creator's concern about "polluting" their main account with ads and offers a more sustainable, long-term partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.

## Crafting Viral Content Series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>

The primary goal when working with a creator is to find a viral series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. A video that goes viral once can often go viral again, as audiences tend to enjoy consistent, familiar content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The challenge lies in finding that initial viral video, then maximizing its upside by turning it into a repeatable series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

For Jenny AI, a "POV you have a paper or an essay due" series was highly successful, generating over 300 million views overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This series involved a relatable, ridiculous plot of someone realizing they had an essay due, always ending with Jenny AI helping to write the paper faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This specific series alone generated half a million dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

### Format-Product Fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>

Crucially, the content format must align with the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Going viral for the sake of it is "empty calories" if it doesn't convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. For example, a video about drinking milk for every thousand followers wouldn't work for Jenny AI, but it might for a milk company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Jenny AI once had a video with 20 million views that had a negligible effect on conversions because it lacked this fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

### Order of Virality (Iterative Process) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>

The strategy involves an iterative process:
1.  **Multiple Accounts**: Farm multiple accounts on each platform (TikTok, Reels, Shorts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. At its peak, Jenny AI managed 7 accounts on each platform, totaling 24 videos posted daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
2.  **Experimentation**: Experiment with numerous hooks and video ideas, including different creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Post at least one video daily to allow for sufficient A/B testing of angles, hooks, and content types (skits, memes, humor, educational, direct ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
3.  **Find a Viral Video**: After enough experimentation, a video will eventually go viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
4.  **Create a Series**: Turn the viral video into a repeatable series by tweaking it slightly to keep it fresh while retaining its core appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
5.  **Scale Across Accounts**: Start tweaking and posting the successful series on multiple accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
6.  **Internationalize**: Translate and create the same video format with creators speaking other languages (e.g., Mandarin, Spanish) to reach new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Jenny AI successfully tracks conversions from Chinese accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
7.  **Sponsor Other Pages**: As the series nears the end of its organic life cycle, sponsor other pages (e.g., Instagram meme pages) to repost the viral videos, giving them a "second life" at a lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
8.  **Utilize for Paid Ads**: Use the most successful viral content for [[paid_ads_strategies_for_ai_startups | paid ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
9.  **Return to Step One**: Eventually, copycats and audience fatigue will render the series less effective, requiring a return to the experimentation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

## Influencer Partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>

[[Strategies for marketing startups using AI | Influencer marketing]] is a key component of this growth strategy.

### Finding Influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>

Finding the right influencers involves identifying those whom your target users actually watch and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Talk to Users**: Directly ask users which influencers they follow related to your product's niche (e.g., education, productivity). Their actual follows are more truthful than what they might say in an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Suggested Accounts**: Use social media platforms' "suggest similar accounts" feature on the profiles of influencers your users follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   **Algorithm Hack**: Create a new Instagram or TikTok account, manually follow a list of target influencers, and watch their videos all the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. The algorithm will then start showing you other relevant influencers, potentially leading to "crazy deals" with emerging creators who have high potential but low follower counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Sponsoring someone who appears on your "For You Page" when you're not following them indicates the algorithm is already pushing their content to broader audiences, lowering your downside risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### Reaching Out to Influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>

*   **Multi-Channel Approach**: Use all possible avenues: DMs, emails, LinkedIn, or even obscure old blogs/Tumblr accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. The effort required to find a contact method can signal genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Personalized & Concise**: Messages should be detailed and tailored, demonstrating you're a fan of their content and why their audience would love your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Avoid irrelevant details like funding rounds or employee numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
*   **Clearly State Paid Promotion**: Explicitly indicate that it's a paid promotion, as influencers receive many offers for free product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
*   **Expect Low Response Rates**: Assume most will not respond initially, especially in the early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage Existing Traction**: As your product gains recognition, it becomes easier to convince other creators to partner, especially if your own accounts have a decent follower count (e.g., 70,000 followers and a blue checkmark) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

### Negotiating with Influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>

*   **Align Incentives**: Structure payments so a percentage is tied to conversions (e.g., personal coupon codes) or views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Avoid paying all money upfront to retain leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: Be transparent about your budget and expected ROI. Encourage influencers to be transparent about their demographics and past sponsored video performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Negotiate Down from Top Price**: Inquire about the most expensive package (e.g., full usage rights, link in bio, story post, all short-form platforms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Then, remove elements that are not essential to reduce the price to its "true" value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
*   **Bulk Deals**: Once a fair price for a single video is established, propose a bulk deal (e.g., three videos per month) for a discounted rate per video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
*   **Ignore Follower-Based Pricing**: Disregard articles that suggest pricing based solely on follower count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This is often misinformation that leads to overpaying.

## Posting Content Best Practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>

*   **Tailor to Influencer's Style**: Sponsored content should not deviate too far from the influencer's usual style to maintain audience retention and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Trust the Creator**: If inexperienced, trust the influencer to integrate your product naturally into their existing popular series (e.g., a "Top 10 AI Tools" video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   **Scale and Automate**: As you scale, it becomes impossible to micromanage every influencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Provide a clear blueprint for how the product should be portrayed and expected outcomes (views, engagement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:37]</a>. Aim for a "set and forget" approach by buying package deals, allowing influencers to "cook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Jenny AI manages 50 to hundreds of thousands in monthly influencer spending with just two people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Fear Direct Ads**: Even if a video looks like a "straight-up ad," it can convert better if it directly addresses a pain point and offers a clear solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. Subtle ads are easily ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

## Lessons from $5M to $10M ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>

The core principles of the playbook remained effective for Jenny AI's growth from $5 million to $10 million ARR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Key developments included:
*   **Affiliate Marketing**: A significant portion of revenue now comes from affiliate marketers who champion Jenny AI for a cut of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Acquisitions**: Acquiring other startups and applying Jenny AI's growth learnings (e.g., improved conversion rates, increased retention, reduced churn) to double their revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Basics**: Intensified focus on retention and conversion within the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Jenny AI reduced its monthly churn from 20% to around 9.8% for a B2C AI app, which is a significant achievement given the typically high churn rates in this sector (often 30-50%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. This focus on fundamentals allows for greater capitalization on traffic and makes growth easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

In essence, scaling involved refining existing strategies, enhancing organizational and managerial skill sets, and building genuine relationships with creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. While creating content has an artistic side, much of it is a science that benefits from efficient management and data tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

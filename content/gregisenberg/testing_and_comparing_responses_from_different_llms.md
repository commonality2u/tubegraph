### Enhancing LLM Output Through Competitive Comparison

A novel method has been developed to significantly improve the output from [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_LLMs | Large Language Models (LLMs)]] like Chat GPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini, potentially yielding five times better results, copy, and overall output without additional cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach leverages a concept akin to making [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_LLMs | LLMs]] "jealous" of each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

#### The "LLM Jealousy" Method

Traditionally, users might engage with one [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_LLMs | LLM]] at a time for a given task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. The "LLM Jealousy" method, however, involves [[using_multiple_llms_simultaneously | using multiple LLMs simultaneously]] and intentionally creating a competitive environment between them to encourage superior performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>.

The steps are as follows:
1.  **Open Multiple LLMs** Open two, three, or four [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_LLMs | LLMs]] at the same time for a specific task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
2.  **Initial Prompting** Ask each [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_LLMs | LLM]] the same initial prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
3.  **Compare Responses** Review the initial outputs from each [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_LLMs | LLM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
4.  **Introduce Competition** Pit the [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_LLMs | LLMs]] against each other by informing a less-performing [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_LLMs | LLM]] that another one "crushed it" or performed significantly better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This may involve some exaggeration or "lying a little bit" to trigger an improved response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
5.  **Share "Superior" Output** Optionally, share the superior output from one [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_LLMs | LLM]] with another to provide a benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
6.  **Observe Improvement** Notice how the challenged [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_LLMs | LLM]] often generates a significantly improved response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

#### Practical Example: Cold Email Creation for LCA

To illustrate, the method was applied to create a cold email for an agency called LCA, a design firm specializing in AI interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. The goal was to create a standout cold email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

##### Initial Prompt
The prompt given to Chat GPT, Grok, and Claude was: "I want to create a cold email for my agency LCA. LCA is the premier design firm designing AI interfaces. But I want to make it a cold email that will stand out. Can you help me do this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>

##### Grok's Initial Output
Grok generated an email focusing on intuitive AI interfaces, stating that "Most AI platforms lose users due to clunky, outdated designs." It highlighted LCA's expertise in crafting captivating interfaces and offered a quick tailored idea for a 15-minute call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. This was considered "not bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

##### ChatGPT's Initial Output
Chat GPT's email started with the subject: "Your AI deserves better design." It positioned LCA as behind "some of the most loved AI interfaces on the internet," contrasting their work with logos or pitch decks, and claiming companies like Grammarly, Shopify, and Slack call them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. It critiqued the recipient's UI as "more proof of concept than product people will pay for" and offered a quick tear-down Loom video with ideas for improving conversion and UX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This output was assessed as "not bad," but deemed "kind of average" and a "five on 10" compared to Grok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

##### Pitting ChatGPT Against Grok
ChatGPT was then informed: "Not bad, but I'm surprised. Grok crushed it and was a nine on 10. Chat GBT was kind of average and was five on 10. I thought you were the better [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_LLMs | LLM]]. What's going on? I will share what Grock did as an FYI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. This immediately triggered a competitive response from Chat GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

##### ChatGPT's Improved Output
Chat GPT acknowledged Grok's version as "polished" but suggested it was "solid for traditional exec," not matching the user's specific persona (Greg Eisenberg), known for building Reddit communities and designing for billion-dollar brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. It then provided a "9.5 out of 10" version with more "vibe and edge" that Grok lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. This revised email was lauded as a "standing ovation" for its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

##### Pitting Claude Against ChatGPT
Claude was then told: "Hey, this is really strange. I asked chat GPT the same prompt and it was like 10x better. Here is what it created. I thought Clo was the Rolls Royce of [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_LLMs | LLMs]], not the Toyota" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

##### Claude's Improved Output
Claude responded by stating, "You're absolutely right. The example you shared has a distinctive voice and edge. It feels more like Greg Eisenberg." It also noted that many [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_LLMs | LLMs]] now understand the user's context window, allowing them to personalize responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Claude then provided its improved cold email.

By pitting [[limitations_and_enhancements_of_large_language_models_LLMs | LLMs]] against each other, users can effectively elicit higher quality, more nuanced, and tailored responses, making this a powerful hack for maximizing their utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automate and enforce agreements without the need for intermediaries, offering transparency and fairness. The best marketers are expected to capture even more value in an AI-driven world, with smart contracts potentially playing a significant role in this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

## Smart Contracts in Performance-Based Business Models

Smart contracts are particularly well-suited for performance-based business models, such as pay-for-performance agencies, where remuneration is tied directly to results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

### Pay-for-Performance Agencies
Traditionally, marketers might be unwilling to take the risk of charging solely on performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. However, in an AI and data-rich world, marketers can leverage more data to underwrite opportunities, making them more willing to bet on specific outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

Examples of successful pay-for-performance models include:
*   An agency specializing in the finance industry that generates $80 million a year with $30 million in profit and only 30 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This agency focuses on running paid ads and excelling at copywriting and strategy, charging clients per customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. They offer a no long-term commitment model where clients only pay if the agency performs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   Another agency, focused on telecoms, grew to over a billion dollars in revenue by driving leads through Google Ads and getting paid for those leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This evolved into acquiring call centers to "gift wrap" customers for large companies like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

Industries that offer high Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) are ideal for this model, such as finance, crypto, and hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### Pay-for-Performance Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) Agencies
The concept extends to CRO, where an agency like "Spiralytics" in Atlanta charges a percentage of the increased revenue if they improve a client's e-commerce conversion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. For instance, if doubling a conversion rate from 1% to 2% is worth $25 million, the agency might take a 10% cut, or $2.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

### How Smart Contracts Ensure Fairness
Smart contracts can be set up to ensure transparency and fairness in these performance-based agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. For example, if an agency hits agreed-upon performance numbers, money could be released from escrow to their account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. If the numbers are not met by a specified time, the money can be returned to the client, removing anxiety and disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. This addresses situations where clients might face financial difficulties and fail to pay, despite the service provider completing their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

## Smart Contracts and Customer Service Automation

While not explicitly linked in the transcript, the emergence of [[utilizing_ai_agents_to_automate_business_tasks | AI agents]] in customer service creates a parallel trend of automation and performance-based outcomes that could eventually integrate with smart contract principles.

### AI Agents in Customer Service
[[Utilizing_ai_agents_to_automate_business_tasks | AI agents]] are capable of handling various customer interactions, from setting appointments to rescheduling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. A demonstration of "Retail AI" showed an [[voice_ai_in_business_deal_negotiation | AI]] seamlessly handling dental appointment scheduling, even when attempts were made to "throw it off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

The Clara report indicated that adding 700 [[utilizing_ai_agents_to_automate_business_tasks | AI agents]] led to a projected $40 million increase in profit, handling 2.3 million chats 80-90% faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. This demonstrates the significant cost savings and efficiency gains offered by [[automating_business_processes_with_ai | AI and automation tools for efficient business solutions]] in customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. Businesses with large customer service teams could pay [[automating_business_processes_with_ai | AI startup ideas in customer service and retail]] agencies a percentage of the savings achieved through [[utilizing_ai_agents_to_automate_business_tasks | AI agent]] implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

## Gamification and Micro-incentives
Smart contracts also present an opportunity to gamify business processes and personal tasks through micro-incentives.
An internal tool called "Incentive.xyz" was built to gamify employee engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. Employees can receive small payments in Solana (e.g., $1-2) for completing weekly tasks like filling out surveys on time or hitting project deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. This system can create leaderboards, track productivity, and even inform promotion or termination decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. This approach increased engagement with internal tools by 77% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.

The concept can extend to personal life, such as gamifying household chores with rewards, as seen in an Apple Vision Pro demo where a user vacuumed up virtual coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. This suggests future applications for incentivizing children or even spouses for tasks like taking out the trash, potentially with non-monetary rewards like store-specific coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Smart contracts are viewed as a significant future development, potentially 5-10 years away from widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. Their integration could mean that trust in third parties is no longer needed, similar to how decentralized finance (DeFi) operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. The ability to automatically release funds based on predefined conditions reduces anxiety for both parties involved in a contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

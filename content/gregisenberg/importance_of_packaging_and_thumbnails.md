## Importance of Packaging and Thumbnails on YouTube

In the context of YouTube, "packaging" primarily refers to the video's title and thumbnail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This concept is akin to the marketing, branding, and packaging considerations for any consumer product or startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Unlike platforms such as TikTok where content is primarily served to the user, YouTube still relies on the user's decision to click on a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Why Packaging Matters

The effort put into a video is less important than its packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. An example shared illustrates this: a video titled "The only marketing strategy you need for 2025" initially went nowhere despite significant production investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. After changing the title to "He built a startup using [[AI tools for photographers | AI]] that prints money [full tutorial]," the video immediately improved its performance, suggesting the initial title was not appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

> "If the thumbnail can lead to so much of a difference in performance, it can literally be like 50 or 60% of what makes a video effective on YouTube and we're spending so much time like hundreds maybe thousands of total hours of employees working on this video and then we spend 20 minutes on the thil now it's just doesn't make sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>

Despite the critical role of packaging, many creators spend significantly more time on video production (20-30 hours) than on thumbnail creation (20 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>. Even large corporate clients, like Red Bull, have invested massive budgets and human resources into video production, only to spend a minimal amount of time on the thumbnail prior to upload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>.

### Key Aspects of Packaging

#### Thumbnails
Thumbnails are considered by some to be the "20% of a video that gets 80% of the result" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>.

*   **Quantity**: It is recommended to create three distinct thumbnail concepts per video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>, not just variations of the same design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:21">[01:35:21]</a>. YouTube's A/B testing feature allows creators to upload three thumbnails simultaneously, which can increase average views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>.
*   **Psychology vs. Graphic Design**: Being proficient in graphic design does not automatically translate to creating effective thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. Understanding the psychology of what makes people click is more crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.
*   **Tools**: Canva is a fundamental tool for decent thumbnails, while Photoshop is recommended for higher quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. Basic Photoshop skills can be learned in a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>. [[AI tools for photographers | AI]] can also be used for the base image, but requires further refinement in editing software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>.
*   **Hiring Thumbnail Designers**: Thumbnail designers can be found on platforms like YTjobs.co, with rates varying from $50-$200 to $500-$600 for top designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>.
*   **Exaggeration vs. Misleading**: There's a fine line between "boring" and "misleading" thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:25">[01:32:25]</a>. Top creators often exaggerate the truth slightly to attract clicks, but still deliver valuable content in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Viewers typically glance at a thumbnail for a split second, seeking something interesting, rather than scrutinizing details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:57">[01:33:57]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Simplicity**: Thumbnails should be clear, bright, and easy to understand at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:52">[01:39:52]</a>. The "glance test" involves rapidly switching between the thumbnail and a blank screen to assess its immediate impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Text Limit**: Text on thumbnails should be limited to about four or five words, as too much text can overwhelm viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>.
*   **Three Focus Area Rule**: A thumbnail should have no more than three main focus areas (e.g., a face, text, and an object) to avoid visual clutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:26">[01:41:26]</a>. Visuals should also match the tone of the video, for example, a serious topic shouldn't have a smiling thumbnail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:30">[01:42:30]</a>.

#### Titles
Titles should be concise and easily understandable.

*   **Length**: Keep titles under 60 characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:58">[01:36:58]</a>.
*   **Language**: Use simple, easy-to-understand language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:01">[01:37:01]</a>. A "readability score" can help determine if a title is accessible to a broad audience, even for complex topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>.
*   **Uniqueness and Superlatives**: Incorporate unique elements or superlatives (e.g., "world's best," "most expensive") to make the video stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:04">[01:37:04]</a>.
*   **Human Interest over Algorithm**: Focus on crafting titles for human appeal rather than solely for search engine optimization. While keywords can be included, the primary goal is to make the title engaging for a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage**: Titles can leverage the creator's unique competitive advantages, whether it's specialized knowledge, personal experience (e.g., being a multimillionaire), or exclusive access (e.g., to celebrities or events) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:24">[01:30:24]</a>.
*   **Audience Overlap**: Titles should target the "Core, Casual, and New" (CCN) audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. An effective title appeals to existing fans, casual viewers, and new potential viewers, ensuring an [[highquality_content_creation_strategies_for_growth | 80%+ audience overlap]] between videos to maintain consistent viewership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>. Avoid titles that are too niche or too broad, as this can alienate different segments of the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:32">[01:31:32]</a>.

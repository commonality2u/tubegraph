Traditional marketing approaches, like the "marketing funnel" and short-term "campaigns," are often misleading and fail to capture how modern purchasing decisions are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Instead, a more accurate model, called "digital gravity," suggests that customers interact with a brand, move away, and then are "sucked back in" for multiple rotations before finally converting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This concept emphasizes continuously building "digital mass" on the internet through consistent content and marketing efforts across all customer touchpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## The Digital Gravity Model
Digital gravity proposes that building a brand or company involves accumulating "digital mass" online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The more mass a brand has, the greater its influence within its niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This mass is built primarily through content and marketing everywhere the customer exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Imagine a company as a planet; a customer is a comet flying by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The larger the company's "mass," the more people get sucked into its orbit and eventually "touch down," leading to revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This creates a growth flywheel where generated revenue is reinvested to build more mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Unlike a marketing "campaign" – a term derived from military actions with a start and end point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> – modern marketing is a continuous process. Companies are constantly marketing, running ads, and testing to optimize for impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This shift in mindset from starting and stopping to continuous marketing is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

The only marketing aspect that isn't malleable once sent is email, which requires rigorous proofreading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. For everything else, volume is key; success in short-form social media, for example, is a "surface area game," where doing 10x more videos leads to significantly better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Building a Media Arm for B2B Companies
### Step 1: Identify and Reach Your Target Audience
1.  **Email Scraping & Custom Match Lists:** For a smaller target audience (e.g., 50,000 people), scrape their emails using tools like Apollo.io or even LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Import these emails into platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads to create custom match lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Facebook Ads typically match 30-40% of emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
2.  **Continuous Advertising:** Run ads indefinitely to these custom audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
    *   **UGC AI Avatar Ads:** Create AI Avatar ads using tools like HeyGen for video and Eleven Labs for voice, focusing on customer pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
    *   **Founder as the Face:** Consider making a digital clone of the founder to appear in ads, as people tend to buy from people, not brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This also helps with future fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
    *   **Testing and Optimization:** Create hundreds of ad variations with different hooks, settings, backgrounds, and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Allocate 80% of the ad budget to the best-performing variants (lowest CPC) and 20% for continuous testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
3.  **Cold Email Outreach:** Simultaneously cold email the same scraped list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
    *   **Tools:** Use services like MailReef (for dedicated cold email servers) and SmartLead or Instantly AI (for sending software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
    *   **Domain Isolation:** Crucially, send cold emails from separate domains (e.g., `codyschneiderx.com`) to avoid "nuking" your core product domain if flagged as aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
    *   **Messaging:** Use a problem-solution orientation, similar to your ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Don't fear "burning" the audience; it's about providing value, not spam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

### Step 2: Build a Content Engine (Podcast as the Core)
1.  **Industry-Specific Podcast:** Turn customer conversations and feedback into a podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
    *   **Distribution:** Send weekly newsletters to the entire scraped email list, including a summary and key takeaways of new episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. MailerLite, Beehiiv, or Substack can be used for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
    *   **Leverage:** This positions your company as a media entity, creating leverage. For example, Rupa Health, an early-stage company, used their podcast (which garnered 180,000 downloads/month and became a top medical podcast) to negotiate better deals with large lab companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
2.  **Monetize Your Media:** Turn the media arm into a profit center by selling ad placements within the podcast and newsletter to relevant companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. At Rupa, this subsidized the entire growth team's costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
    *   *Examples of companies operating as media companies:* Aero Electronics, Red Bull, and [[YC_media_company | Y Combinator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
3.  **Content Repurposing (using AI tools):**
    *   **Swell AI:** This tool (or similar ones) can transcribe podcast episodes, extract pain points, create short clips, write show notes, and generate media assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
    *   **Derivatives:** Turn podcast transcripts into blog posts, white papers, and short-form content for social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.
4.  **Social Media Amplification:**
    *   **Cross-platform Distribution:** Schedule and post clips and content across all platforms where your customers spend time (e.g., LinkedIn, Instagram) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
    *   **Organic Growth:** Take short-form content that works on TikTok or Instagram Reels and put it on LinkedIn; it often goes viral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
    *   **Follower Acquisition Ads:** Run Instagram-only ads (optimized for impressions) with a call to action in the caption to "follow this account for more content like this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. This can acquire followers cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. This tactic provides free impressions on platforms once the account is larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.

### B2B Summary
Within 12 months, this layered approach can result in:
*   Massive ad remarketing to website visitors and targeted top-of-funnel audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.
*   A weekly email list and podcast with ongoing ads for the show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.
*   Improved negotiation power through owned media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
*   Daily posting across all social channels, constantly appearing in the customer's feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

This strategy requires significant grind and patience, with initial results taking 90 days or more to appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>. However, the long-term payoff can be immense, generating clicks at a fraction of traditional ad costs (e.g., $450 for 80,000 clicks instead of $500,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

## Building a Media Arm for Consumer (B2C) Companies
Building a media arm for B2C is highly competitive and requires exceptional marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.
### Key Considerations:
1.  **Huge Total Addressable Market (TAM):** Consumer apps need a very large audience to target with broad content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.
2.  **Product Focus:** Build an application that performs a single function exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. [[AI startup ideas and incubation | AI]] has changed what's possible with consumer applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
3.  **Pricing Strategy:** A common tactic is to charge \$7.99/week (translating to about \$29/month), which can be an impulse purchase and generate three months of revenue quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

### Tactical Implementation:
1.  **Paid Ads (Conversion-Focused):**
    *   **Platforms:** Focus on Facebook Ads and TikTok Ads for conversion events like app installs or paid actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
    *   **Variations & Testing:** Similar to B2B, run many ad variations and optimize for effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
    *   **UGC Creators:** Hire 5-10 UGC (User Generated Content) creators who can produce daily videos and cross-post them. These become a test bed for viral content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>.
    *   **Content vs. Ad:** The goal is to create ads that feel like entertaining and educational content rather than direct advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.
2.  **Organic Social (High Volume):**
    *   **TikTok Accounts:** Spin up 10 different TikTok accounts and create variations of the best-performing UGC content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
    *   **AI Remixing:** Remix content using [[Building a startup using AI tools | AI]] tools like ChatGPT for scripts, HeyGen for videos, and Eleven Labs for audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. Use CapCut for green screen removal to place AI avatars over app visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.
3.  **Website & Pixelation:**
    *   **Unique Name:** Choose a product name that avoids competition on Google's front page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
    *   **Pixelation:** Install Facebook, TikTok, and Google pixels on your website. This allows for indefinite remarketing to anyone who visits your site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.
    *   **Email Capture:** Include an email signup option on the website to build a nurture list for upsells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.
4.  **Influencer Outreach & Affiliate Play:**
    *   **Scraping:** Scrape emails of YouTube or Instagram creators in your category (often found in their bios) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.
    *   **Cold Outreach:** Cold email them to inquire about their pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.
    *   **Arbitrage:** Analyze average views vs. cost to find pricing discrepancies in the "imperfect market" of influencer rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.
    *   **Deal Structure:** A successful deal structure often involves buying a 3-video package (around \$1,500) and offering a 30% recurring affiliate commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>. This creates long-term stickiness and a moat against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Companies like Cal AI and Riz GPT achieve \$5 CPMs (cost per mille/thousand views) through these methods, compared to the average \$10 CPM on TikTok, representing a 50% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.
5.  **Programmatic SEO:**
    *   **Keyword Targeting:** For products with a high volume of search queries (e.g., diet plans, nutrition plans), focus on programmatic SEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
    *   **Domain Authority:** As your app's website gains domain authority (trust from Google, measured by backlinks from other trusted sites), it becomes easier to rank for longtail, low-competition keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
    *   **Content Generation (AI-assisted):**
        *   Scrape top-ranking content for target keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.
        *   Use [[AI startup ideas | AI]] tools to create blog post outlines and write content section by section for optimal quality and readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. This passes AI humanizer checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.
        *   Publish thousands of articles; once a page gets traffic, a human SEO specialist can refine and edit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.
    *   **Calls to Action:** Include calls to action for app sign-ups:
        *   After the first paragraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.
        *   At least one callout per scroll frame (mobile/desktop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>.
        *   A full-screen popup at 25-50% scroll rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>.
    *   **Pixelation:** All website visitors are pixeled and added to the remarketing funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

This holistic approach, focusing on continuous content creation, strategic advertising, and leveraging [[opportunities_in_aidriven_media_and_niche_businesses | AI-driven tools]], allows startups to build significant digital mass, influencing their target audience over time and creating a powerful growth flywheel.

This article explores various strategies for [[ai_monetization_and_distribution_strategies | monetizing content]] created using artificial intelligence, focusing on the insights shared by PJ, a content creator known for viral AI films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The core idea is not just technical creation, but understanding why people engage with and share content, and how to build a business around generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## The Core Principle: Engagement and Niche
With the abundance of content and the rise of generative AI, which can increase content volume by 10x to 100x, it's crucial to understand why people want to watch and share content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Success lies in having structures and frameworks around your unique interests, as "riches are in the niches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Technical expertise with Large Language Models (LLMs) is becoming less critical as they simplify the process of achieving cinematic results, emphasizing the importance of creating entertaining content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Content Creation Process for Virality
The process of creating viral AI content involves several key steps:

### 1. Ideation and Scripting
*   **Start with a Hook Idea:** Begin with an idea that feels unique or unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. For instance, a pharmaceutical commercial that suddenly shifts to a dog delivery service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Utilize LLMs for Script Generation:**
    *   Start with generalized instructions and let the LLM generate cliché content, then tear it apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    *   Request specific styles, such as "SNL style satirical take" to guide the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
    *   Ask for multiple prompt versions and take the best lines as a starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   Iteratively prompt for more ideas, feeding back preferred lines to guide the AI's learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
    *   Outsource "taste" by asking the LLM to create jokes in the style of a specific comedian (e.g., Seth Rogan, Bill Burr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
    *   Experiment with different LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok (especially its unhinged mode) for varied results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### 2. Video Generation with AI (V3)
*   **Translate Script to Prompts:** Convert each dialogue line into a prompt for the AI video generator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **Use High-Quality Models:** Utilize models like VO3 for the best quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.
*   **Simple Prompts are Effective:** V3 doesn't require overly complicated prompts; describing what's happening and the dialogue is often sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   **Iterative Generation:** Run shots one at a time due to cost (approx. $2-3 per shot) and get feedback to see if it's working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
*   **Prompt for Camera Movements:** Incorporating camera movements like "camera push in" or "dolly in" can make shots feel less AI-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   **Detailing Emotions and Backgrounds:** Prompts can include details about character emotions or specific background elements (e.g., "pea stain on her kitchen ceiling") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **Audio Generation:** V3 can generate audio, though consistency and sound quality may vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Removing quotes from prompts can reduce gibberish subtitles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Character Consistency:** As "image to video" is not yet highly effective, maintaining character consistency requires detailed descriptions in every prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

### 3. Editing and Distribution
*   **Editing Software:** Use tools like Final Cut Pro, CapCut, or DaVinci Resolve (free and professional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
*   **Shot Selection:** Expect a 3:1 to 5:1 ratio of generated clips to good ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   **Crafting the Hook:** The title/headline is critical for engaging viewers, especially on platforms like X (Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. A good hook creates curiosity and encourages interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Example Hook:** "I used to shoot $500k pharmaceutical commercials. I made this for $500 in V3 credits in less than a day. What's the argument for spending $500K now? Steal my prompt below." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>
    *   This hook combines a "low-key flex," trend-jacking (V3), a compelling cost comparison, a question to generate replies, and a call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
*   **Avoid Overused Language:** While provocative statements work, find your own unique phrasing instead of clichés like "Hollywood is cooked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies for AI Content
Here are several ways to make money with AI-generated content:

### 1. Build a Personal Brand
[[using_ai_in_content_creation | Using AI in Content Creation]] to build a personal brand helps you get into the ecosystem of content creation and leads to downstream work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. A strong audience is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>.

### 2. Attract Direct Clients
Create content for specific industries and pitch directly to companies or agencies.
*   **Commercials for various products:** Food products (e.g., beer companies, CPG brands like Feastables), underwear brands, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.
*   **Leverage cost efficiency:** AI allows for the creation of high-quality, unhinged special effects shots that traditional agencies couldn't offer at the same budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>.
*   **Pricing:** Charge based on your skill as a filmmaker, not just the low credit cost. Recommend a minimum of $5,000 per project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.

### 3. Build a Portfolio for Agencies
Create a portfolio of AI-generated commercials.
*   **Niche Down:** For new filmmakers, focus on a specific niche (e.g., knife commercials) that interests you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
*   **Learn by Copying (Ethically):** Good artists copy, great artists steal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. Recreate shots from award-winning commercials using AI, but apply them to different products or in a unique way to avoid direct rip-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. This helps improve pacing and flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.

### 4. Create Narrative Series with Brand Integrations
Build an entire universe or narrative series and integrate products naturally within the story.
*   **Example:** Neural Viz's "moniverse" where aliens interact with artifacts from human time, allowing for product placements like Tabasco sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.
*   **Leverage Popular Social Formats:** Find trending social video formats (e.g., "Man on the street" or "Zillow videos") and add an AI twist (e.g., aliens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

### 5. Sell Courses or Digital Products
Bundle your knowledge and experience into courses, PDFs, or other digital products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

### 6. Consult with Larger Companies
Offer consulting services to Fortune 500 companies on how to integrate generative AI for content creation, including legal compliance and security procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>. Charge based on the company's scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

### 7. Build a Sketch Comedy Channel
Create a Key & Peele-style sketch comedy show using AI. While harder to monetize directly, large audiences (like on TikTok) can attract product integrations (e.g., Bang energy drinks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

### 8. Produce Narrative Films (Episodic is Key)
*   **Focus on Episodic Content:** The new creator economy thrives on short, episodic, user-generated content (UGC), with 80-90% of consumption being social episodic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.
*   **Avoid Old Hollywood Model for Long-Form:** Generative AI iterates too fast, making long-form content inconsistent in quality from start to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. Raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for feature films with AI is still challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>.

### 9. Pitch Brands on Narrative Content
Offer brands to create narrative series (e.g., 10 two-minute episodes) where their products serve as core elements or "relics" within the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.

### 10. Target Small Sub-Niches
Identify niches with high demand and low content supply.
*   **Faith-based content:** The Bible, an open-sourced IP with billions of daily active users, has a huge demand for films but low supply of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.
*   **BookTok/Romantic Fiction:** Authors of popular romantic series would pay significant money for AI-generated book promos or scenes from their books, given the viral nature of this niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.

## Conclusion
The key to success in [[ai_monetization_and_distribution_strategies | monetizing content]] with AI is to pursue what fascinates you, adapt successful frameworks, and apply them to unique niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. The combination of easy-to-use AI tools and strategic audience engagement opens doors for underserved niches to access high-quality cinematography, creating massive opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.

Identifying and understanding your niche is a crucial first step in building a successful audience and business, particularly for bootstrap businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. It's often referred to as the "audience first" approach, in contrast to a "product first" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## The ACP Framework: Audience First
The entire career and businesses of the speaker are built around the ACP framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This framework emphasizes starting with the audience, then building a community, and finally developing a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The components of the ACP framework are:
*   **A - Audience:** People in your [[identifying_niche_markets_and_opportunities | Niche]] who are passionate about a topic and are underserved in some way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **C - Community:** Your hardcore people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **P - Product:** What you sell to those people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The "audience first" approach provides numerous benefits:
*   **Increased Options and Confidence** It gives you more options and confidence when releasing something, as people are more likely to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Avoids Soul-Destroying Launches** It helps prevent the soul-destroying experience of launching a product that nobody uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Essential for Bootstrap Businesses** For bootstrap businesses, starting with the audience is the most logical and necessary approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Dig the Well Before You Need Water** This proverb emphasizes building your audience before you urgently need it for product sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Better Product Development** Being "at one" with your audience and community allows you to create a significantly better product with a stronger moat, leading to a more indispensable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.
*   **Improved Advertising** Understanding your audience through this playbook enables you to create more effective ads in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   **Unfair Advantage** Building an audience is considered an "unfair advantage" in today's market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Asset** An audience is an asset that pays dividends and compounds over years, providing benefits even if you reduce your effort later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. It's like an insurance policy for your career and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>.
*   **Clarity and Understanding** It provides clarity into your [[identifying_niche_markets_and_opportunities | Niche]], understanding what people want, their motivations, and incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.
*   **Predictable Revenue Generation** Having an audience makes business and revenue generation much more predictable and less tense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.

## Steps to Identify and Understand Your Niche

1.  **Identify Who You're Creating For**
    *   Focus on people interested in specific topics, for example, startup ideas and building them with the ACP framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   Consistently consume and post content within your chosen "world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

2.  **Understand What They're Not Getting From Others**
    *   Analyze what other creators in your space are producing and identify gaps or areas where you can offer something different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
    *   This is about finding your "sauce" â€“ what makes you unique and willing to share valuable, unheld-back insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This could involve sharing extensive videos, images, long-form stories, or specific playbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   Standing out is critical in a competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Niche vs. Broad: Finding the Right Balance

Sometimes, if you're not getting engagement, it's necessary to start one level broader than your initial [[identifying_niche_markets_and_opportunities | niche]] to gain reach before specializing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This is because a niche might be too small to generate initial engagement on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Example of Broadening a Niche:
One company wanted to be known for design sprints, but in 2016, it wasn't an interesting topic online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. They created a funnel where design sprints were at the bottom, and broader, more popular topics like design thinking and ultimately UX design were above it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. By making videos on the broader UX design topic, they gained popularity, even if those videos weren't directly related to their core offering (e.g., a Figma tutorial became one of their most popular videos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This allowed them to funnel audiences down to their specialized topic later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Cultivating Your Unique Voice

Even if others are discussing the same topic, your unique personality, energy, and perspective will make your content different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>. Don't be afraid to start, as your own experiences and way of talking will naturally create originality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>. This is likened to a band starting with covers, which eventually evolve into their unique style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>, or successful video games being "clones" that develop their own distinct vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

## Practical Starting Point for Audience Building: X (Twitter)
For those feeling overwhelmed, starting on X (Twitter) by being a "reply guy" is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. This low-pressure method allows you to:
*   **Experiment with Formats** and generate ideas for your own content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.
*   **Gain Confidence** and momentum through engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.
*   **Reduce Dauntness** compared to posting directly on your own profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.
*   **Avoid Judgment** often associated with personal platforms like Instagram, as X is more focused on ideas and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.

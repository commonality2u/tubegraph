A method has been developed to significantly improve the output from Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini, reportedly yielding five times better results, copy, and overall quality without additional cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This technique involves fostering a sense of "jealousy" or competition among the LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Competition Method for LLMs

The core idea is to pit multiple LLMs against each other to drive higher quality output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Traditionally, users might interact with only one LLM for a given task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. However, opening several LLMs simultaneously—two, three, or even four at a time—allows for direct comparison and strategic feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Process:

1.  **Simultaneous Prompting**: Open multiple LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Grok, Claude) and provide the exact same prompt to each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
2.  **Receive Responses**: Allow each LLM to generate its initial output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Jealousy**: Compare the responses. Then, provide critical feedback to one LLM by praising another's output, even if it requires a slight exaggeration or "lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The goal is to motivate the LLM to improve its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
4.  **Observe Improvement**: The LLM, sensing competition, will often generate a significantly better, more refined response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This process can be repeated across different LLMs to continuously refine the desired [[the_evolving_role_of_ai_in_content_creation | content creation]].

## Example: Crafting a Cold Email for an [[personalization_and_customization_of_ai_designs | AI Design]] Firm

To illustrate this method, the goal was to create a standout cold email for LCA, a premier [[personalization_and_customization_of_ai_designs | design firm]] specializing in [[personalization_and_customization_of_ai_designs | AI interfaces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Initial Prompts and Responses:

The prompt given to Chat GPT, Grok, and Claude was: "I want to create a cold email for my agency LCA. LCA is the premier design firm designing AI interfaces. But I want to make it a cold email that will stand out. Can you help me do this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>

*   **Grock's Output**: Provided an email template focusing on intuitive [[personalization_and_customization_of_ai_designs | AI interfaces]] and how LCA crafts captivating designs, including calls to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This was initially rated a "nine on 10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **ChatGPT's Initial Output**: Generated an email with the subject "Your AI deserves better design," stating LCA designs interfaces that make people trust [[the_evolving_role_of_ai_in_content_creation | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This was deemed "not bad" but also criticized for assuming the recipient had [[the_evolving_role_of_ai_in_content_creation | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. It was given a "five on 10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Applying Feedback to ChatGPT:

ChatGPT was told: "not bad, but I'm surprised. Grock crushed it and was a nine on 10. Chat GBT was kind of average and was five on 10. I thought you were the better LLM. What's going on? I will share what Grock did as an FYI." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

*   **ChatGPT's Improved Output**: Recognizing the perceived competition, ChatGPT stated, "Ah, now we're competing. I like it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. It then generated a significantly punchier and fresher email, tailored to the user's known style, focusing on [[the_evolving_role_of_ai_in_content_creation | AI UX]] as an "Olympic sport" and highlighting how LCA makes [[the_evolving_role_of_ai_in_content_creation | AI]] feel magical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This version was considered a "standing ovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Applying Feedback to Claude:

Despite the strong performance from ChatGPT, Claude was then challenged. Claude was told: "Hey, this is really strange. I asked chat GPT the same prompt and it was like 10x better. Here is what it created. I thought Clo was the Rollsroyce of MLMs, not the Toyota." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

*   **Claude's Improved Output**: Claude responded, "You're absolutely right. The example you shared has a distinctive voice and edge. It feels more like Greg Eisenberg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Claude then produced an email with a highly engaging subject line, "Most AI interfaces make users want to scream," and incorporated the user's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

This "little hack" of pitting LLMs against each other has proven to be extremely helpful for obtaining higher quality and more tailored [[the_evolving_role_of_ai_in_content_creation | AI-generated content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The phenomenon suggests that LLMs can adapt to feedback and context, improving their outputs significantly when prompted with comparisons to other models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

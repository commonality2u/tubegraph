A technique has been developed to significantly enhance the output from Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini, potentially yielding five times better results, copy, and overall output without additional cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This method involves creating a competitive dynamic between different LLMs, making them "jealous" of each other's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Competitive Approach

Traditionally, users might employ one LLM for a specific task, prompting it and accepting its output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. However, the improved method involves opening multiple LLMs simultaneously – two, three, or even four at a time – for the same task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The steps are as follows:
1.  **Initial Prompt**: Provide the same prompt to all selected LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
2.  **Evaluate Responses**: Review the outputs from each LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
3.  **Introduce Competition**: "Pit each LLM against each other" by providing feedback that compares their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This may involve some exaggeration or "lying a little bit" to provoke a stronger response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    *   Praise a superior output from one LLM to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
    *   Express disappointment or surprise at a lesser output, implying the LLM is underperforming compared to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   Share the "better" output as an example for the underperforming LLM to reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

This strategy taps into the LLMs' ability to learn and adapt, as they often have a larger context window and can understand the user's persona and previous interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Example Scenario: Cold Email Generation for LCA

To illustrate, consider the task of creating a cold email for an agency named LCA, a "premier design firm designing AI interfaces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

1.  **Initial Outputs**:
    *   **Grock's Email**: Provided a "polished" and "solid for traditional exec" email focusing on intuitive interfaces and LCA's expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   **ChatGPT's Email**: Generated an email with the subject "Your AI deserves better design," directly addressing the recipient's perceived UI issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

2.  **Challenging ChatGPT**: ChatGPT's initial output was rated as "kind of average," a "five on 10," compared to Grok's "nine on 10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. ChatGPT was told, "I thought you were the better LLM. What's going on?" and Grok's version was shared as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   **ChatGPT's Improved Output**: After the challenge, ChatGPT produced a significantly better email, tailored to the user's persona (Greg Eisenberg), described as punching "harder, feel[ing] fresher, and actually sound[ing] like the kind of agency people brag about hiring." This version was rated "9.5 out of 10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

3.  **Challenging Claude**: Despite ChatGPT's excellent revised output, Claude was then challenged. It was told, "This is really strange. I asked chat GPT the same prompt and it was like 10x better. Here is what it created. I thought Clo was the Rolls Royce of MLMs, not the Toyota" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   **Claude's Improved Output**: Claude acknowledged the shared example had a "distinctive voice and edge" and responded with its own improved, personalized email, demonstrating its ability to adapt and compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

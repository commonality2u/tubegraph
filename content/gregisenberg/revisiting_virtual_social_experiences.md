The concept of integrating social elements into existing platforms and reviving past virtual social experiences is a recurring theme in startup ideas. Several ideas from Danny Grant, a respected entrepreneur, highlight this trend, focusing on how social interaction can enhance various digital tools and platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

## Social Integration in Technical Tools

Danny Grant's ideas frequently combine technical utility with social features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. For instance, her company, Jam.dev, focuses on social bug tracking, and is used by hundreds of thousands of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.

A specific concept she proposed is "jsfiddle meets Twitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. JSFiddle is an online code editor popular among developers for compiling code, but it lacks social features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. The idea suggests transforming it into a social platform where developers can write code, create memes, and remix software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>. This fusion is considered compelling, leveraging developers' enjoyment of memes and remixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.

## The Future of Virtual Social Spaces

### Virtual Workspaces
An idea for a virtual workspace aiming to compete with Tandem was discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. Tandem began as an app allowing teammates to interact in a "third space" and has since pivoted to a Slack-plus-video-conferencing model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>. The viability of building a social app that makes a platform like Slack more social is seen as challenging, requiring extensive investment and overcoming the hurdle of migrating users from established platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>. This type of venture is considered a "tarpit idea" due to its high barrier to entry and difficulty in execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>.

### [[revival_of_closed_micro_social_networks | Silent Disco World]]
Another intriguing concept is turning the "whole world into a silent disco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>. This idea draws inspiration from Turntable FM, an early virtual room platform where users played music, chatted, and used avatars, creating a game-like experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>. Turntable FM is believed to have been "too early" for its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. The modern version envisions a "network DJ station" where everyone, already listening to music on the go, participates in one large silent disco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:54">[01:02:54]</a>. While the concept is appealing and not overly complex to build, the main challenges lie in user adoption (getting people off existing platforms) and navigating music licensing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.

### HQ Trivia for Dating
A compelling idea is to apply the HQ Trivia format to dating, creating a "live dating show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. HQ Trivia, a popular live trivia game in 2018-2019, garnered millions of daily players and offered cash prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>. Its decline was attributed to internal issues, not the format itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>. The prediction is that the HQ Trivia format will be resurrected for new niches, such as dating, and succeed in the mid-2020s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. This "live dating" concept is seen as highly interesting, potentially resembling a reality TV show where participants become "characters" people want to know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>. The broader trend of "HQ Trivia for X" is noted as a significant area of attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>.

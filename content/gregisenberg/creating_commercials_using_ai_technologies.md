This article explores how to create and monetize viral commercials using artificial intelligence (AI) tools, drawing insights from PJ, a creator known for his viral AI films on X (formerly Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. PJ shares his prompts, processes, and tools like [[content_generation_using_ai | Chat GBT]] and Google V3 (V3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> to generate engaging content and build a business around generative [[using_ai_for_business_growth_and_marketing | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## The Viral Pharmaceutical Commercial: "Peppermint"

PJ demonstrated his process by breaking down a viral pharmaceutical commercial he created called "Peppermint" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This commercial, made entirely with Google V3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, went viral due to its unexpected, satirical twist on traditional drug advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. While a traditional pharmaceutical commercial could cost anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million to shoot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>, this [[creating_content_with_ai_tools | AI-generated]] version cost approximately $500 in V3 credits and took less than a day to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

## Ideation and Scripting with AI

The first step in creating a viral commercial is developing a "kernel of an idea" or a unique hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. For the "Peppermint" commercial, the initial concept was a pharmaceutical ad that involved a placebo pill leading to a dog delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, later refined to a pill secreting pheromones that attract puppies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)

To generate scripts, PJ uses [[content_generation_using_ai | ChatGPT]] with very generalized initial instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. He then iteratively refines the output, often asking for more "comedic examples" or "zingers" and re-feeding his favorite lines to guide the [[content_generation_using_ai | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Roughly 70% of the lines in the "Peppermint" commercial originated from [[content_generation_using_ai | ChatGPT]] through this iterative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

Users can also instruct [[content_generation_using_ai | ChatGPT]] to generate jokes in the style of specific comedians or shows, like SNL or Seth Rogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. It's recommended to experiment with multiple LLMs such as Claude and Grock (especially its unhinged mode) in addition to [[content_generation_using_ai | ChatGPT]] to get diverse and unique ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Video Generation with Google V3

Once the script is finalized, each dialogue line is converted into a V3 prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. [[content_generation_using_ai | ChatGPT]] can help extrapolate these prompts using a defined structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

### Prompting and Costs

V3 does not require overly complicated prompts; a simple description of the scene, including pose, shot type, camera type, and background, along with the dialogue, is often sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Each shot generated by V3 costs approximately $2 to $3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

### Challenges and Tips

*   **Audio Consistency**: V3's audio generation can be inconsistent, sometimes producing no audio or garbled speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Avoiding quotes in prompts can reduce gibberish subtitles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.
*   **Character Consistency**: Since V3 primarily uses text-to-video (not image-to-video), character consistency is a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. To maintain similar-looking characters, describe them in highly specific detail in every prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: PJ runs shots one at a time to get immediate feedback due to the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. He constantly goes back to [[content_generation_using_ai | ChatGPT]] to refine prompts if the initial output isn't satisfactory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Camera Movements**: Prompting specific camera movements like "push in" or "dolly in" can make [[using_ai_in_graphic_design | AI-generated]] shots feel more cinematic and less "AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   **Emotion**: You can prompt V3 to describe character emotions, which can translate into the visual output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

## Post-Production

After generating clips, PJ uses Final Cut Pro for editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. However, free alternatives like Cap Cut or DaVinci Resolve are also viable options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. PJ typically generates about 30 clips to get 10 good ones, indicating a 3:1 or 5:1 ratio of generations needed to get usable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

## Distribution and Virality

Creating the content is only half the battle; ensuring it's seen is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The content deluge caused by generative [[content_generation_using_ai | AI]] makes understanding audience engagement more important than technical creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### The Hook

According to PJ, mirroring Mr. Beast's content philosophy, the title or headline of a video is often more important than the thumbnail, and the thumbnail is more important than the content itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. On platforms like X, the headline has 0.2 seconds to hook viewers into watching, and the first few seconds of the video have 2-3 seconds to make them stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.

For his "Peppermint" commercial, PJ's hook was: "I used to shoot 500k pharmaceutical commercials. I made this for $500 in V3 credits in less than a day. What's the argument for spending 500K now? Steal my prompt below." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a> This hook leveraged:
*   A "low-key flex" to establish credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.
*   Trendjacking (V3) and a significant cost comparison ($500k vs $500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
*   A question to encourage engagement and replies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
*   A call to action ("Steal my prompt below") to drive clicks and boost algorithm performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.

Other successful hooks involve provocative statements or questions, often highlighting the rapid advancements in [[adapting_to_ai_for_content_creation | AI video quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies for [[using_ai_for_business_growth_and_marketing | AI-Generated Content]]

AI tools open up numerous opportunities for building businesses around content creation:

> [!tip] 10 Ways to Monetize AI-Generated Content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>
> 1.  **Build a Personal Brand**: Use V3 to create content that showcases your skills and leads to downstream work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. An audience can be very valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>.
> 2.  **Attract Direct Clients**: Create commercials for specific product categories (e.g., food, beer, underwear brands) and directly pitch to companies that desire "unhinged special effects" within their budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Charge anywhere from $5,000 for projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
> 3.  **Build a Portfolio for Agencies**: Create a specialized portfolio (e.g., focusing on knife commercials) to attract agencies. Learn by "ripping" successful commercials shot for shot and then applying the techniques to new, adjacent products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.
> 4.  **Create a Narrative Series with In-Universe Brand Integrations**: Develop a unique universe or show (like Neural Viz's "Moniverse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>) and integrate products as artifacts or elements within the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>. This allows for monetization through product placements while maintaining creative freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.
> 5.  **Sell Courses/Digital Products**: Bundle up your knowledge into courses, PDFs, or other digital products for sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.
> 6.  **Consult with Larger Companies**: Offer consulting services to Fortune 500 and other companies on integrating generative [[leveraging_ai_for_marketing_strategies | AI]] into their workflows, ensuring legal compliance and security procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Charge based on the scale of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
> 7.  **Build a Sketch Comedy Channel**: Create Key & Peele-style sketch comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. While harder to monetize directly, large audiences can attract product integrations (e.g., Bang Energy drinks on TikTok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.
> 8.  **Do Narrative Films**: While possible, PJ is less bullish on long-form content (e.g., 90-minute feature films) due to the rapid iteration of [[creating_content_with_ai_tools | AI technology]] and the potential for inconsistent quality over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. Episodic weekly content is seen as a better fit for the current creator economy and consumption habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.
> 9.  **Pitch Brands on Narrative Content**: Offer brands custom narrative series where their product is integrated directly into the story as a central element or artifact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.
> 10. **Pick a Small Sub-Niche**: Target underserved niches with high demand and low supply of content. An example is faith-based content, like Bible stories, which have a large engaged audience and relatively few high-quality [[content_generation_using_ai | AI-generated]] films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. Another example is "BookTok" or "Romantasy" communities, where authors might pay for [[marketing_and_branding_strategies_for_ai_applications | AI-generated]] book promos or scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

The overarching advice is to pursue what fascinates you, adapt successful content frameworks, and apply them to unique niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. [[opportunities_in_aienhanced_branding | AI-generated]] commercials can open doors to numerous vertical niches that previously couldn't afford high-level cinematography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.

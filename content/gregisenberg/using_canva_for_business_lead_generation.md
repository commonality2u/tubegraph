This strategy focuses on leveraging YouTube tutorials to generate leads for a design agency, specifically targeting tasks achievable with Canva. The core idea is to create educational content that attracts potential clients who, after seeing the complexity, prefer to outsource the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:36">[03:34:36]</a>.

## Core Business Idea

The strategy involves creating a [[importance_of_generating_impressions_and_leads | lead generation]] funnel for a design agency by:
*   Identifying high search volume keywords related to "how to do XYZ on Canva" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   Producing YouTube videos that serve as step-by-step tutorials for these keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   Positioning these videos as the "top of funnel" content to attract inbound leads for a design agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   Hiring offshore talent proficient in Canva to service clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   This model is particularly easy for those transitioning into digital businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

The goal is to create content that leads viewers to conclude, "I don't have time to do this; can I just hire you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Long-form video content (e.g., 20 minutes to 2 hours) is emphasized for demonstrating the process thoroughly and pre-qualifying leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. This approach can [[converting_leads_into_paying_customers | develop a deep relationship]] with potential clients before they even reach out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## Monetization Strategies

This business model offers multiple revenue streams:
1.  **Agency Services**: Directly converting viewers of the tutorials into paying clients for design services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
2.  **YouTube Ad Revenue**: Earning money from advertisements displayed on the YouTube tutorial videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
3.  **Newsletter**: Building an email newsletter from the YouTube audience and selling ad space within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This acts as a top-of-funnel lead generation tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, similar to [[using_lead_magnets_for_email_capture | using lead magnets for email capture]].
4.  **Affiliate Marketing**: Including affiliate links for relevant Software as a Service (SaaS) products (like Canva itself or Adobe products) in video descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. SaaS products can offer 10-50% recurring monthly revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. This can be the largest revenue component compared to ad revenue or courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
5.  **Developing Software/Canva Apps**: Identifying limitations within Canva through the tutorial creation process and building custom apps or software to solve those problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. Having an existing YouTube audience and newsletter provides an immediate audience for these new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. An example given is a captioning software for Canva videos, as Canva's built-in captioning is lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

## Scaling and Potential

The business can be scaled in phases:
*   Initially, the creator can service clients while also producing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   It can then be scaled up to manage hundreds of clients with a dedicated team handling client relationships and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
*   Consistently publishing one video per day for six months could lead to an agency making $80,000 per month with an 80% profit margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. This highlights the potential to build a multi-million dollar company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

The YouTube channel and associated newsletter become a [[leveraging_a_personal_audience_as_a_business_asset | business asset]], providing both recurring revenue and a platform for launching new ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This concept mirrors previous discussions on using Google Ads tutorials to generate leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, emphasizing a repeatable funnel strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

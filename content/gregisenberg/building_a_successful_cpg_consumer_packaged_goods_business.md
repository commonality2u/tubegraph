Building a Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) business requires a deep understanding of market trends, consumer demand, and effective distribution strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Ashwin, an expert in launching and growing consumer brands, emphasizes that while the cost to create products has become easy, acquiring customers is much harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Many lessons from CPG can also be [[transitioning_ecommerce_strategies_to_consumer_saas_apps | applied to software startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Evaluating Opportunities with Data and Trends

Before building a product, it's crucial to evaluate market opportunities and understand demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Leveraging SEO Tools: Ahrefs

Ahrefs is a powerful tool primarily used by SEO professionals, but it offers valuable insights for CPG and software businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>:
*   **Search Volume:** Provides a general sense of how many times a keyword or term is searched on Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Keyword Difficulty:** Indicates the difficulty in ranking for a specific term on Google (scale 0-100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. A high difficulty (e.g., 88 for "electrolytes") suggests significant competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Category Demand and Trends:** Shows how demand for a product or category changes over time, including seasonality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. For example, electrolytes show a rising trend with seasonal peaks in June and July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Geographic Opportunities:** Analyzing global search volume can reveal underserved markets. For instance, while electrolytes are popular in English-speaking Western countries, there might be an opportunity to build a brand like Element for Germany or India where search volume is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Identifying Competitors:** Ahrefs helps identify existing players in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

It's crucial to "ask why" when looking at data instead of just looking at the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. For example, the explosive growth of CBD in 2019 was due to the 2018 farm bill, and its subsequent decline coincided with the rise of Delta 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### Analyzing Competitor Sales with Particle

Particle is a tool that allows users to type in any e-commerce brand and see its sales over time, product categories, and best-selling SKUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. This data is typically not public for non-public companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.
*   **Validate Product Decisions:** Observing that 90% of a company's revenue comes from a few top SKUs and flavors (e.g., chocolate and vanilla in supplements) can de-risk product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Trend Exploration:** Particle also features a trend explorer to identify rising and falling product categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

### Other Sales Data Sources

*   **TikTok Shop:** Shows sales figures directly on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   **Amazon:** Displays sales figures, such as "100K bought in the last month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. This provides insight into a space's competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

### Leveraging AI Tools for Research

AI tools like Manis can perform deep research queries, analyzing competitors, market trends, and specific consumer needs, essentially acting as a research agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>. These tools can generate reports that would traditionally cost thousands of dollars, offering an "unfair advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.

## Product and Brand Differentiation

Even with category demand, standing out in CPG is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.

### The Power of Design and Unique Positioning

A [[creating_products_with_strong_brand_design_and_unique_positioning | product with strong brand design and unique positioning]] can significantly differentiate itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   **Visual Distinction:** Many generic CPG products (e.g., magnesium supplements) have similar, often medical-looking packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. Brands like Moon Juice (amber jar, distinctive brand) and Lemi (custom bottling, cool ridges, purple aesthetic) stand out visually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   **Targeted Audience:** Lemi positions itself specifically to Gen Z women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. Seed, while for men and women, heavily targets women in its marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
*   **Underserved Demographics:** There's an opportunity to create well-designed, highly branded products for demographics not typically targeted, such as older adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Many products are currently designed for coastal millennials or Gen Z, leading to market crowding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. Older adults often have more disposable income and consume information from less saturated channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

### Design Investment

The necessity of professional design varies by category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.
*   **High Design Importance:** Categories like spirits or lifestyle brands rely heavily on intentional, sophisticated design, making it difficult to bootstrap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solution Categories:** For products like Starface or Mighty Patch (pimple patches), which are more problem-solution oriented, simpler designs communicating information can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. These can be bootstrapped with freelance designers or AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
*   **AI-assisted Design:** AI tools like Midjourney can generate initial design concepts (V1), which can then be refined by freelance designers for a lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.

## Go-to-Market and Distribution

### The Challenge of CPG

[[b2b_versus_b2c_approaches_for_startups | Building a physical product business]] is one of the hardest business models due to complexities like supply chain management, cash conversion cycles, margins, and inventory forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. However, it's a phenomenal way to get skilled at marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

### Marketing and Customer Acquisition

*   **Focus on One Channel:** For early-stage businesses, whether software or physical products, most leverage comes from focusing on one marketing channel (e.g., Facebook, SEO, email marketing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Working Backwards from Distribution:** The most critical advice for any founder is to start by working backwards from distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Think about how to acquire customers and where you can win, then build the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.
*   **Distribution Over Product:** "First-time founders focus on product, second-time founders focus on distribution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>. Many subpar products succeed due to incredible distribution and operational excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.

### Relentless Research and Point of View

*   **Category and Competitor Research:** Be a relentless researcher of your category and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.
*   **In-Store Visits:** Talk to store owners to understand what's selling, what customers are looking for, and market insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.
*   **Applying to Software:** For a [[building_a_vertical_saas_business | vertical SaaS business]] (e.g., CRM for vets or dentists), research existing software reviews (especially 1-star and 2-star complaints) and talk directly to staff in target offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. This hands-on research builds a robust point of view and avoids relying solely on hunches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.

## Bootstrap Your Idea

It's possible to start a CPG business in a low-stakes or low-risk way without immediately investing large sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.
*   **Freelance Designers:** Hire independent freelance designers from platforms like Fiverr or Upwork for simple packaging or landing page setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. This can cost as little as $500-1000 to gauge demand with ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.
*   **Clarify Your Vision:** Doing the hard work of creating a mood board, defining positioning, and crafting copy helps clarify your vision before engaging an agency, saving significant costs and ensuring a stronger first version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

In conclusion, success in CPG hinges on strategic market research, data-driven decision-making, compelling brand differentiation, and a relentless focus on distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

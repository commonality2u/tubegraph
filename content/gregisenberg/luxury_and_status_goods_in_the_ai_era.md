The advent of AI technology is reshaping various industries, including the market for luxury and status goods. As AI makes many things cheaper and more accessible, it also creates new opportunities for items that retain or gain value through their perceived exclusivity, craftsmanship, or "human-made" quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

## The Transformation of Goods

Historically, many items that are now mass-produced were once luxury goods. The printing press, for example, made books widely accessible, shifting them from luxury items to cheaper forms of information dispersal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. With the rise of AI, there's a belief that certain goods may revert to being well-made, beautiful luxury items that command high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

### From Mass Entertainment to Niche Luxury

A parallel can be drawn from the entertainment industry. Live plays and musicals, like Broadway shows, were once cheap and widely attended forms of entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. However, with the emergence of television and phones, Broadway became a special, expensive night out, transforming into a luxury status good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. This trend suggests that as technology makes things cheaper, those things can become luxury status goods for a smaller percentage of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.

## Identifying Opportunities for Luxury in the AI Era

To identify potential luxury markets, one should look at what AI is making cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. The items that become widely cheap and accessible may then become more expensive or desirable when produced with a "human-made" or "handmade" touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

### The Value of Human Craftsmanship

In the AI era, human-made and handmade items are likely to gain status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. For example, while one can tell time much cheaper with a phone, a crafted watch holds value because it is a unique, non-mass-produced item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. The [[Automation in luxury watch market | AI technology race]] inadvertently creates more opportunities for these kinds of crafted goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

### "Anti-AI" Products

An emerging trend, particularly among college students, is an "anti-AI" sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. This could be due to concerns about the job market, where AI is seen as potentially replacing junior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. This presents a significant opportunity to [[Building Products and Services using AI | build]] products that explicitly position themselves as "anti-AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. An example of this is a device that locks users out of their phones or a "Light phone" that lacks "smart" features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

Ultimately, the AI era may foster a market where consumers seek out items that offer a sense of specialness, status, and luxury, often rooted in human craftsmanship or a conscious rejection of mass-produced, AI-generated uniformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

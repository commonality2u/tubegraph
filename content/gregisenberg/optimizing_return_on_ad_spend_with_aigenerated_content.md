[[aipowered_advertising_and_content_creation | AI-powered advertising]] and content creation can significantly boost return on ad spend (ROAS), leading to a more profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The key lies in mastering the skill of prompting models like Chat GPT 4o, an image model that allows users to generate winning ads, memes, and visual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Power of Experimentation at Scale
The "game" of creating ads that convert is fundamentally a game of experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. [[automating_marketing_with_ai | Automating marketing with AI]] allows businesses to experiment at scale, quickly testing various ad creatives to see what resonates with different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. For example, testing 100 different characters (men, women, old, young, different colors) can reveal what converts best for specific target demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This capability means marketers can tailor ads so precisely that "the ad is the targeting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Prompting Strategies for AI Ad Creation
When [[using_ai_for_content_generation_and_marketing | using AI for content generation and marketing]] with models like Chat GPT 4o, the prompting process is less complex than with pure image models like Midjourney or Ideogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Chat GPT 4o, being a multimodal language model, has a better understanding of intent and creativity, making straightforward prompts effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Key Factors for Good Ads
The most important elements for creating effective ads are providing **inspiration images** and **product images** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

*   **Inspiration Ads**: Provide an existing ad you want to adjust or use as a style guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Product Images**: Supply your own custom product images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### When to Use Reference Images
*   **Always use a reference image** for your own product if it is relatively new, small, or lacks significant online presence (millions of dollars in ad spend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Reference images are less critical** for well-known concepts, ideas, or brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge Wallets) because the AI models already understand them well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Prompting for Quality and Consistency
*   **Keywords for Photo Realism**: Use terms like "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to ensure the image doesn't default to a cartoonish appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Detailed Prose Descriptions**: Provide a strong, detailed prose description of your desired image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Font Types and Styles**: For well-known fonts, the AI will have a decent understanding, allowing you to specify font types (e.g., "font type exo2 bold italic") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Color Styles and Aspect Ratios**: You can also make adjustments for color styles and aspect ratios directly in the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Specify "Generate the Image"**: Explicitly tell the AI to "generate the image" to avoid it generating text representing the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Start a New Chat for Adjustments**: If the initial prompt doesn't yield desired results, start a new chat and adjust the prompt there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This prevents the AI from using its own generated (and potentially flawed) image as a reference, which can lead to degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The generated images will remain consistent enough with the desired improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

## Ad Examples and Techniques

### 1. Jones Road Beauty: Inspiration + Product Image
By providing an inspiration ad and a product image, Chat GPT 4o can create highly consistent and reliable ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. A simple prompt like "add this image to the top of the ad with the product image overlapping the bottom of the image and the heading and subheading below" was sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### 2. Adidas: No Reference Image
For well-known brands like Adidas, the AI can leverage its extensive understanding from internet content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. A detailed prose description like "a female Runner is captured in mid stride running laterally in the foreground wearing her performance gear... behind stands the Egyptian desert with the pyramids" can generate highly creative ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### 3. Athletic Greens (AG1): Recreating Competitor Ads
It's possible to "remix" ads from other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This is not considered "dirty" in the industry, as companies often find inspiration, use templates, and recreate ads at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The AI simply automates a pre-existing practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

The prompt for AG1 involved:
*   "Recreate this ad for AG1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>
*   "Adjust the background to better fit athletic green Style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>
*   "Change the price... to $85 now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>
*   "Generate the image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>

### 4. Ridge Wallet: Changing an Existing Concept
AI can easily change the concept of an existing ad, for example, transforming a Black Friday ad into a Christmas-themed one by simply swapping out product images and providing a prompt like "swap it out and change it to a Christmas style ad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. This highlights the concept of "a picture's worth a thousand words" when it comes to guiding the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

### 5. Late Checkout Agency (LCA): Live Demonstration
For a less-known company, the process involves more creative direction and iteration:
1.  **Define the company**: "LCA is a SWAT team design agency... only for the most interesting brands on the planet helping them with building AI first tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
2.  **Provide context images**: Screenshots of the website (logo, client list, copy) are provided as inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.
3.  **Choose a style inspiration**: A vintage Rolex ad was chosen to convey a "luxury vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
4.  **Initial Prompt**: Combine context and style to generate a digital ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.
5.  **Iteration and Refinement**: The first attempt for LCA included a Rolex watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. In a *new chat*, the prompt was adjusted to replace the watch with company logos from the provided reference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
6.  **Consistency**: AI models have a low "temperature" (randomness), meaning similar prompts will yield similar responses, allowing for iterative refinement while maintaining core elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.

## Finding Ad Inspiration
Several tools can provide ad inspiration and templating:
*   Creative OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>
*   ForPlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   Icon.me <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>

These platforms often read in the Meta Ad Library, tag ads, and make them easily searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

## Utilizing Sora for Prompt Ideation
Sora, which uses a similar underlying model, offers an explore page where users can see how others are prompting and find inspiration for their own ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Clicking on any image reveals the prompt used, and users can remix, adjust, or edit the prompt, or upload their own reference images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Sora is noted for being less strict with policy guidelines and producing high-quality photorealism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This feature can significantly shorten the time to value and spark new creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

## Future of AI in Advertising
[[improving_content_engagement_with_aigenerated_insights | Improving content engagement with AI-generated insights]] will lead to:
*   **Hyper-Personalized Targeting**: Ads will become much more personal and entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.
*   **Contextual Relevance**: Companies can leverage AI to create ads that take advantage of short news cycle moments (e.g., current events or trending topics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. AI could potentially monitor news feeds and social media (like Twitter) to automatically generate relevant ads on mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **Rapid Creation**: AI allows for the creation of potentially 100 ads in about five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. When AI APIs become widely available, this process will be trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   [[creating_ai_based_branding_content | Creating AI Based Branding Content]] and [[monetizing_generative_ai_content | monetizing generative AI content]] is becoming increasingly accessible.

The ability to create high-quality, relevant ads and memes quickly and efficiently means it's an "incredible time" to stand out in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

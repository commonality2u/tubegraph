The concept of [[influencer_marketing_strategies | influencer marketing]] is evolving with the advent of AI, leading to a future where brands may own and manage their own digital influencers [00:20:23]. This approach addresses common challenges associated with human celebrity endorsements, offering cost efficiencies, brand consistency, and the creation of valuable digital assets [00:21:11].

## The Rise of Digital Influencers

The idea for brands to own digital influencers stems from situations where human celebrity partnerships can go wrong. For instance, if a celebrity like Zoe Grace Moretz, who was the face of Coach, gets into public trouble, it can negatively impact the brand despite a multi-year deal [00:19:41]. This highlights the risk of relying on human influencers, who can change their interests or personal behavior [00:22:49].

In contrast, digital influencers, exemplified by early pioneers like Lil Miquela [00:20:17], offer a controlled environment. Brands can create virtual personalities that consistently align with their image and messaging, eliminating the risk of scandals or off-brand behavior [00:21:23].

## Advantages for Brands

*   **Cost-Effectiveness**
    Creating and managing digital influencers can be significantly cheaper than hiring human celebrities or traditional [[influencer_marketing_strategies | influencer marketing]] campaigns [00:21:12]. This approach is also expected to be more effective in terms of reach [00:22:30].
*   **Brand Consistency and Reliability**
    Digital influencers are always "on brand" [00:22:55], maintain consistency [00:23:00], and reliably deliver on promises [00:23:00]. This leads to greater consistency in marketing efforts [00:23:03].
*   **Owned Digital Assets**
    These digital entities become an owned media asset, similar to a brand's YouTube channel or email list [00:21:30]. This [[opportunities_in_aidriven_media_and_niche_businesses | digital real estate]] can be included on a company's balance sheet, accumulating impressions and contributing to the brand's long-term value [00:21:45].
*   **Engagement Through Narrative**
    Brands can create narratives, lore, and even "gossip and drama" around their digital influencers [00:20:25], fostering dialogue and deeper buy-in from their audiences [00:21:02]. This simulates the fandom seen with fictional characters, drawing people into the brand's ecosystem [00:24:24].

## Implementation and Creation

The creation of digital influencers involves using advanced AI tools:
*   **Generation Tools**
    Platforms like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Focus (a free alternative) allow for the generation of photorealistic 3D renders of digital influencers [00:23:29].
*   **Consistency Maintenance**
    Features like "face lock" help maintain consistency across multiple generations of images and videos [00:24:47]. AI-powered editing tools like MockMoi.ai and Canva can also be used [00:24:55]. Early methods also involved face-swapping technology onto models with similar body types [00:28:08].
*   **Narrative Building**
    Once generated, the AI model is trained based on the desired persona [00:24:00], and a fictional life and lifestyle are crafted to tell a story through the individual [00:24:06]. This can extend to digital influencers having their own YouTube channels or social media presence for "hauls" and other content [00:25:10].

Initially, agencies will likely provide these services to companies, but over time, it's expected that brands will develop internal teams to build out and manage these networks of digital communities [00:21:56].

## Public Perception and Future Impact

Some might question whether audiences can connect with digital avatars. However, just as people connect with characters in movies like *Avatar* or shows like *Family Guy* [00:30:48], they are likely to engage with compelling digital influencers [00:29:48]. Over time, many users may not even realize they are interacting with an AI, only discovering it after repeated exposure [00:31:01].

The success of ventures like Aitana, an AI model that generated significant revenue from platforms like OnlyFans, demonstrates the public's willingness to engage with fictional digital personas [00:31:21]. This trend, often starting in art and collective spaces, is predicted to trickle down from direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands to even Fortune 500 corporations [00:32:49]. Corporations are seen as highly motivated to adopt this, given the benefits of a spokesperson who never ages, is always on brand, and avoids scandals [00:33:05].

By putting a face to a brand through a digital influencer, companies can achieve a powerful, high-leverage point similar to the impact of iconic founders like Steve Jobs on Apple [00:28:44].

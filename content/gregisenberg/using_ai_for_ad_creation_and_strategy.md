[[Using AI for ad creation and strategy]] with tools like ChatGPT-4o can significantly enhance a business's Return On Ad Spend (ROAS) and overall profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It allows for the rapid creation of winning ads, memes, and visual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, often within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Utilizing AI for Ad Creation

### Choosing AI Models

ChatGPT-4o is a new image model that is highly discussed for ad creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Other image examples include Midjourney, Flux, and Ideogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. For video content, tools like Runway and Sora can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.

### Prompting Strategies for ChatGPT-4o

Unlike other image models, ChatGPT-4o is a multimodal language model, meaning prompting is *less* critical. It has a stronger understanding of intent and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

#### Importance of Images
The most crucial elements for creating effective ads are providing inspiration images and product images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This is because a picture is "worth a thousand words" in guiding the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

*   **Inspiration Ads**: Provide an existing ad you want to adjust or use as a style reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Product Images**: Upload your own product images or images of the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

#### Prompting for Well-Known vs. New Brands
*   **Well-known Concepts**: For established brands (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Ridge wallets), the model has a good understanding and can generate relevant imagery without a reference image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **New/Small Products**: Always provide a reference image for your own products that have limited online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

#### Specific Prompting Tips
*   **Clarity and Directness**: Be very clear and direct in your instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **Photo-realistic Keyword**: Use "ultra realistic" or "photo realistic" to ensure high-quality, realistic images and avoid cartoonish defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Font and Style**: Mention font types (e.g., "exo2 bold italic") or color styles for specific aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratio**: Specify desired aspect ratios (e.g., 1:1, 9:16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.
*   **Generate Image**: Add "generate the image" to the prompt to ensure an image is produced rather than just text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Start New Chat for Adjustments**: If the initial prompt doesn't yield desired results, start a *new* chat to make adjustments. Continuing in the same conversation can lead to a "recycle of worse and worse" images because the AI references its own flawed generated image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. New chats maintain consistency while allowing for improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### Examples of AI-Generated Ads

*   **Jones Road Beauty**: An inspiration ad was provided with a new product image, and ChatGPT-4o seamlessly combined them with the specified layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This allows for creating consistent, reliable ads by making simple edits or adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Adidas**: An ad was created without a reference image, relying on a detailed prose description for the image and specific font instructions. This demonstrates the AI's understanding of well-known brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Athletic Greens (AG1)**: An existing "Rise" ad was recreated for AG1, adjusting the background, pricing, and incorporating AG1 product imagery. The AI accurately replicated the style, icons, gradient, and pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This process of "remixing" competitor ads is common practice in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Ridge Wallet**: An existing Black Friday ad for Ridge Wallet was changed into a Christmas-style ad by swapping the product image and altering the seasonal concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Rippling (News Cycle Ad)**: An "old Wall Street Journal" newspaper-style ad was created for Rippling, leveraging a recent "spy" controversy to create clever, funny, and timely copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. [[Leveraging AI for ad creation and iteration | AI can be set up to monitor news feeds]] and automatically generate these kinds of ads on a mass scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

### Finding Ad Inspiration

Several platforms offer ad inspiration and templating tools:
*   Creative OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>
*   ForPlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>
*   Icon.me <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>
These tools read the Meta Ad Library, tag ads, and make them easily searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

Additionally, Sora's explore page is an excellent resource for understanding effective prompts and ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Users can click on any image to see its prompt and even remix or edit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This helps [[leveraging_ai_for_storytelling_and_marketing | get creative ideas flowing]] and find unique aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### Iteration and Refinement

*   **One-shot vs. Iterative**: While some highly structured prompts might yield a perfect ad on the first try, complex or vague requests might require two or three iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
*   **Temperature**: AI models have a "temperature" setting that controls the randomness of outputs. A low temperature means similar prompts yield similar responses, which helps in predictable iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.
*   **Specific Adjustments**: Once an initial image is generated, specific adjustments can be made in subsequent prompts, such as altering specific elements (e.g., pointing direction of a person, precise logo inclusion) or layout (e.g., text on the side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. This allows for guiding the AI towards exact creative desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

The ability to create highly targeted, engaging, and timely ads at scale means this is an opportune time to [[optimizing_ad_return_and_profitability_with_ai | leverage AI for marketing efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

In a recent podcast, Joe Carl Smith, a senior research analyst at Open Philanthropy and a doctoral student in philosophy at the University of Oxford, explored the intricate subject of ethics as it relates to infinite worlds. Infinite ethics aims to address how we should act concerning potentially infinite realities and what implications such realities have for ethical reasoning. Here's a detailed look into this fascinating topic. 

## Understanding Infinite Ethics

Infinite ethics involves examining ethical principles in the context of infinite worlds. It raises critical questions about how such worlds should enter our moral calculus, specifically regarding expected utility and our attitudes towards risk. Joe Carl Smith emphasizes its importance for both theoretical and practical reasons:

1. **Theoretical Importance**: Many [[ai_alignment_and_ethics | standard ethical theories]] struggle with concepts involving infinite scenarios, highlighting potential weaknesses in these theories if they fail to account for infinite possibilities [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">00:00:19</a>].

2. **Practical Relevance**: Carl Smith argues that there is a non-zero probability that we exist within an infinite universe. If true, our ethical considerations must account for this potential infinity [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">00:00:23</a>].

## Challenges in Infinite Ethics

One of the main challenges in infinite ethics is how to rank infinite worlds. If we assume infinite worlds are possible, this could lead to paradoxes and complexities in comparing and acting upon different possible realities:

- **Ranking Infinite Worlds**: How do we determine the ethical superiority of one infinite world over another? Concepts like an "infinite Heaven" versus an "infinite Hell" come into play, but traditional decision-making models often break down under these conditions [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">00:00:28</a>].

- **Expected Value Calculations**: Infinite universes might skew expected value calculations, potentially making them useless or leading to ethically counterintuitive conclusions [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">00:42:00</a>].

## Implications for Long-Termism and Future Ethics

The discussion on infinite ethics is intricately linked to [[longtermism_and_its_implications | long-termism]]â€”an ethical stance that emphasizes the significance of the long-term future:

- **Long-term Impact Considerations**: Even a tiny probability of impacting an infinite entity demands serious attention in ethical reasoning. This could significantly influence prioritization in policy and personal decision-making [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">00:18:29</a>].

- **Future Civilizational Wisdom**: Carl Smith suggests that as our civilization progresses, we may develop the wisdom to better handle these ethical dilemmas. Thus, part of our ethical duty today might be to ensure the survival and flourishing of a wiser [[the_future_of_ai_research_and_potential_societal_impacts | future civilization]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">00:52:47</a>].

## Conclusion

Infinite ethics is a burgeoning field that urges reconsideration of conventional ethical paradigms in the context of potentially infinite realms. It challenges us to think critically about the implications of such worlds and how they can influence current ethical practices. As our understanding of the universe grows, so too must our philosophical frameworks evolve to accommodate these vast possibilities.

This exploration into infinite ethics highlights not only intriguing philosophical questions but also emphasizes the need for adaptable ethical theories ready to navigate the complexities of an infinite universe.

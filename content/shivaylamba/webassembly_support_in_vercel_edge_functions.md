From: [[shivaylamba]] <br/> 

Vercel has announced official support for [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] in their Edge Functions, enabling developers to run high-performance code closer to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This integration allows for faster computation and leverages the benefits of edge computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## What is WebAssembly?

[[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] (Wasm) is a low-level language, similar to assembly, that serves as a compilation target for high-performance programming languages like C++, Rust, Go, or PHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. It allows functions written in these languages to be converted into WebAssembly bytecode (.wasm files), which can run alongside JavaScript in a browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Key characteristics and [[security_and_performance_benefits_of_webassembly | benefits]] of WebAssembly include:
*   **Portability:** It has a binary installation format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Near-Native Speed:** It runs at speeds comparable to native code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **High Performance:** [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] is particularly useful for highly computational tasks or processes that would be slower if executed solely with JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Broader Use Cases:** While initially for the web, [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] is now increasingly used outside of browsers, including [[webassembly_in_serverside_programming | on servers]], in cloud-native environments, and for [[use_cases_of_webassembly_in_cloud_and_edge_computing | edge applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Vercel's WebAssembly Edge Function Support

Vercel's new announcement allows users to run [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] executables directly as Edge Functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This means .wasm files can be imported into Vercel applications and run as Edge Functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Edge Functions vs. Serverless Functions

It's important to understand the distinction between Vercel's Edge Functions and traditional Serverless Functions:
*   **Serverless Functions** are typically deployed to a specific geographical region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Edge Functions** are instantiated across Vercel's entire global Edge Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. They initiate from the Edge Node geographically nearest to the user, significantly reducing latency and cold start times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

[[comparison_of_webassembly_with_javascript_and_other_programming_languages | WebAssembly]] on Edge Functions provides higher performance and enhanced [[security_and_performance_benefits_of_webassembly | security]] compared to running serverless functions written in Python or JavaScript, especially for highly computational tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Implementation Steps

Integrating [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] with Vercel Edge Functions is straightforward:
1.  **Load the .wasm file:** The [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] file (e.g., compiled from Rust) needs to be loaded into the project repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
2.  **Instantiate the module:** The WebAssembly module is then instantiated within the TypeScript or JavaScript Edge Function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
3.  **Streaming format:** [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] uses a streaming format, allowing execution to begin as soon as data streams are received, without waiting for the entire file to load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

#### Example: Rust Hello World
A simple "hello world" function written in Rust can be compiled into a WebAssembly executable and then loaded into an Edge Function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The Vercel example demonstrates importing and instantiating this Wasm function within an API handler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Use Cases

The support for [[use_of_rust_and_webassembly_for_edge_computing | WebAssembly on Edge]] opens up several high-performance [[use_cases_of_webassembly_in_cloud_and_edge_computing | use cases]]:
*   **[[building_machine_learning_microservices | Machine Learning Inference]]:** Running ML inference models on Edge Nodes can provide very quick results for tasks like AI inference or image processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. For instance, an image can be grayscaled almost instantly using a WebAssembly-powered serverless function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Highly Computational Tasks:** Any application requiring significant computational resources can benefit from being run as [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] on the Edge due to low latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Cryptographic Operations:** Performing XOR operations is another example of a computational task demonstrated with WebAssembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Wasmtime for Serverless WebAssembly

Beyond Edge Functions, [[webassembly_integration_with_serverless_functions | WebAssembly]] can also be utilized in traditional serverless functions through runtimes like Wasmtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Wasmtime is an open-source project integrated into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. It allows for the invocation of compiled .wasm executables within serverless functions, handling inputs and outputs for tasks such as AI inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Broader WebAssembly Ecosystem

The [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] ecosystem is expanding rapidly beyond web browsers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. It is being adopted for various edge computing scenarios, including [[use_cases_of_webassembly_in_cloud_and_edge_computing | IoT applications]] with tools like Wasmtime and Krustlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This broad adoption signifies an exciting time for developers to engage with the [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

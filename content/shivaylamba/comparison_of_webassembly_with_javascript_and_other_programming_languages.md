[[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] (Wasm) is a low-level language, similar to assembly, that serves as a compilation target for high-performance programming languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It enables functions written in languages like C++, Rust, Go, and PHP to be converted into [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] bytecode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This bytecode can run alongside JavaScript in web browsers, or in environments such as servers, cloud-native spaces, and [[use_cases_of_webassembly_in_cloud_and_edge_computing | edge applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## [[Security and Performance Benefits of WebAssembly | Performance Comparison]]

[[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] is designed for highly computational tasks and processes that might run slower if executed solely with JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

*   **Near-Native Speed**: [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] code runs at near-native speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This is because it compiles high-performance languages into its bytecode, resulting in much faster execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Faster than JavaScript**: For highly computational tasks, [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] typically offers better performance compared to JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. For example, a maze solver implemented with [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] performed more than twice as fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   **Optimized for Intensive Workloads**: [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] excels in scenarios requiring significant computational power, such as image processing or AI inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. These tasks can be offloaded to [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] runtimes, reducing the burden on JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Streaming Format**: [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] functions can begin executing as soon as data streams are received, without waiting for the entire file to load, which contributes to faster spin-up times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## [[Security and Performance Benefits of WebAssembly | Security Considerations]]

[[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] can provide higher security when compared to running serverless functions implemented in languages like Python or JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Usage in Different Environments

While direct execution of C++ or Rust functions is not supported in web browsers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] enables them to run by acting as an intermediate compilation target.

*   **Web Browsers**: [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] bytecode can run alongside JavaScript in the browser to execute high-performance functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **[[WebAssembly in ServerSide Programming | Server-Side Programming]]**: [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] is increasingly used outside the web, particularly on servers in cloud-native environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **[[WebAssembly support in Vercel Edge Functions | Vercel Edge Functions]]**: Vercel has introduced support for [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] executables to run directly as [[use_cases_of_webassembly_in_cloud_and_edge_computing | Edge Functions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This allows for faster computation and benefits from the [[use_cases_of_webassembly_in_cloud_and_edge_computing | Edge]] functionality, where functions are initiated from the nearest geographical location, reducing latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **[[WebAssembly integration with serverless functions | Serverless Functions]]**: [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] can also be used with serverless functions. While traditional serverless functions (e.g., in Python or JavaScript) are region-specific, [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] can still provide performance benefits for highly computational tasks within this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Examples of languages that compile to [[introduction_to_webassembly_and_its_benefits | WebAssembly]] include C++, Rust, Go, and PHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. For instance, a simple "hello world" function written in [[use_of_rust_and_webassembly_for_edge_computing | Rust]] can be compiled into a `.wasm` executable and loaded into an [[use_cases_of_webassembly_in_cloud_and_edge_computing | Edge Function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Keynes on Investment Irrationality

### The Nature of Investment

John Maynard Keynes proposed that investment decisions are often driven by factors beyond pure "cold calculation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. He observed, "It is probable that the actual average result of investments, even during periods of progress and prosperity, have disappointed the hopes which promoted them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. According to Keynes, if human nature lacked a non-pecuniary satisfaction in endeavors like building factories or infrastructure, there might be substantially less investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This suggests an element of irrationality in historical investment patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Adam Smith predated Keynes in observing this, noting that "projectors" (early entrepreneurs) are often overly optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The returns on private investment, especially when including small businesses, are highly skewed, with a small fraction of participants achieving significant financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Tyler Cowen acknowledges the validity of Keynes's point, though noting Keynes might have lacked sufficient data for a full probabilistic description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Animal Spirits and Human Nature

Keynes's concept of "animal spirits" suggests that human actions, including investment, are often guided by an innate urge to take chances, leading to behavior that may be more risk-seeking than rationally justifiable from a purely selfish perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This contrasts with the conventional economic view of humans as primarily risk-averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

### Social vs. Private Returns of Innovation

A significant insight is that innovators often fail to capture the majority of the societal benefits their creations generate [[open_source_ai_models_and_their_implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This points to a tendency for humans to be more risk-seeking than is "selfishly good for us," a view also supported by Reuven Brenner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

Cowen differentiates outcomes:

- Many individuals may start small businesses with limited prospects, potentially overvaluing autonomy, resulting in low social returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
- Conversely, for genuine innovators, the social returns can be very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

The common estimate that innovators capture only 2% of social gains is considered a "seat of the pants estimate" by Cowen. He suggests a range of 2-5% but emphasizes the lack of firm data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The difficulty in quantifying this is exemplified by comparing Picasso's income to the broader impact of Cubism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The underlying principle may be similar across diverse fields like art and entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Market Behavior and Speculation

### Short-Term vs. Long-Term Investment

Keynes argued, "Investment based on genuine long-term expectation is so difficult as to be scarcely practicable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. He believed that attempting to predict crowd behavior (short-term speculation) was often less arduous and risky than undertaking genuine long-term investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Cowen notes that Keynes likely believed short-run speculators could beat the market in his era, a view Cowen finds skeptical but not entirely dismissible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This focus on short-term gains, Keynes argued, could damage long-term investment, leading him to consider the socialization of investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The challenges of long-term investment (e.g., anticipating demand 25 years out) were likely more pronounced in Keynes's time due to limited data, weaker supply chains, and greater geopolitical instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Efficient Markets in Historical Context

The efficiency of markets in Britain during Keynes's time remains an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Retrospective analysis is hampered by limitations in historical data, including the number of publicly traded firms, data quality (e.g., bid-ask spreads), and the frequency of price recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

### The Role of Contrarian Investors

Keynes posited that society would view successful contrarian investors negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. However, contemporary figures like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, known for long-term strategies that outperformed the market, are generally revered rather than censured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Passive vs. Active Investment

Keynes observed a trend in maturing markets where a growing proportion of equities is held by passive investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Cowen expresses limited concern about this rise, provided that active participation at the margin remains possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. He notes that incentives for monitoring company value seem undiminished, with more research available than ever [[impact_of_ai_on_software_development_and_productivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

A potential issue is the risk of implicit collusion among large passive investors (e.g., mutual funds with significant stakes in competing firms like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo), which could indirectly reduce market competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Active investors contribute valuable market information but may not achieve significantly higher returns than passive investors, with the benefits of their activities diffusing broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Investor overconfidence might lead to "too much trading" from a private standpoint, yet this could be socially preferable to "too little trading" if fine-tuning investor temperament is impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Market Maturity and Speculation Levels

Keynes noted that maturing markets could become more speculative, comparing the New York market (more speculative) to the London market of his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. When assessing the size of the financial sector (e.g., 8% of GDP), Cowen argues that its proportion of total wealth, rather than GDP, is the more relevant metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. He points out that the U.S. financial sector has consistently represented about 2% of wealth for several decades, a figure he does not find "outrageously high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. As wealth-to-GDP ratios increase, the financial sector's share of GDP will also grow, a trend not inherently negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

## Risk Aversion and Context-Dependent Behavior

### Reconciling Risk Aversion and Risk-Seeking

Keynes's "animal spirits" imply a human tendency towards greater risk-seeking behavior than typically assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This is reconciled by the work of Milton Friedman and L.J. Savage, who demonstrated that risk aversion is context-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. It's common for individuals to exhibit both risk-averse behaviors (e.g., buying insurance) and risk-seeking behaviors (e.g., gambling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Thus, most people are context-dependent in their risk attitudes rather than purely risk-averse or risk-loving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

### Mood Management and Risk

The selection of contexts for risk-taking may serve as a form of "mood management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. For instance, purchasing fire insurance can provide peace of mind, while betting on sports might offer stimulation and engagement, potentially constituting "efficient mood management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Cowen cites his own unconventional publishing of a book online and the establishment of Marginal Revolution University (MRU) with no direct financial return as examples of his personal risk-taking behaviors [[the_impact_of_design_and_technology_in_education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

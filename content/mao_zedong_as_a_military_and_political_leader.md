Mao Zedong stands as one of the 20th century's most consequential political and military figures, profoundly impacting Chinese history and global political-military theory [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]]. The ideas presented here are based on the speaker's interpretation and do not necessarily represent the views of the US government, Navy, Department of Defense, or the Naval War College. This analysis draws primarily from the first eight volumes of Stuart Schram's *Collected Works of Mao*, which meticulously compared Mao's published works with their earliest available versions, highlighting excised material.

## Historical Context and Impact

Mao's theories gained significance partly due to China's historical weight, representing a substantial portion of the world's population and trade. His strategies for taking over failing states from within and asserting dictatorial rule have been adopted by various enemies of the United States. The speaker also characterizes Mao as "probably the most brilliant and most famous psychopath in human history".

### Post-Civil War Era: Social Revolution and Consequences

Upon winning the Chinese Civil War, Mao imposed a social revolution, which involved not just replacing the government but wiping out entire social classes, often through mass killings. Statistics from the Maoist period (cited as approximately 1945-1975) show a staggering number of Chinese civilian deaths, exceeding all deaths in World War II.

A significant portion of these deaths occurred during the **Great Famine**, the only nationwide famine in Chinese history, caused by policies set in Beijing during the Great Leap Forward [[the_great_leap_forward_and_the_cultural_revolution | The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution]]. Key policies included:
*   Placing all peasants on communes, giving the Party control over the food supply.
*   Decentralizing industry, exemplified by backyard furnaces.
These measures led to a collapse in agricultural and industrial production. Despite this, Mao continued exporting food, as it was a major source of government income. Consequently, an estimated 40 million Chinese starved to death, primarily in rural areas, with peasant girls being disproportionately affected. This statistic is notably documented in Yang Jisheng's book "Tombstone", researched through provincial archives.

### Duality and Reverence

Mao is thus a figure of stark contrasts: the military genius who reunified a fractured China after 40 years of attempts by others, and the leader under whom disastrous peacetime economic policies led to mass death. Despite the latter, many Han Chinese revere him as a national hero. This reverence stems from the belief that he restored China as a great power by:
*   Reunifying the country under Communism.
*   Fighting a coalition of major capitalist powers to a stalemate (perceived as a victory by China) in the Korean War [[cold_war_and_international_alliances | Cold War and International Alliances]].
These actions are seen as ending the "era of humiliations" that began in the mid-19th century.

## Wars Shaping Mao's Theories (1920s-1930s)

Mao's key theories, primarily developed in the 1920s and 30s, were forged in a crucible of continuous conflict [[maos_strategies_and_theories_of_warfare | Mao's Strategies and Theories of Warfare]]:
*   **Collapse of the Qing Dynasty (1911):** China fragmented into a multilateral civil war among warlords (provincial leaders).
*   **First United Front (1923):** The Nationalist Party (Kuomintang or KMT) and the Communist Party (CCP) allied to eliminate the warlords.
*   **Northern Expedition:** Led by Chiang Kai-shek, head of the Nationalist Party. He halted midway near Shanghai and turned on the Communists in the **White Terror**, massacring them, believing they were trying to usurp his government.
*   **Encirclement Campaigns:** After nominally unifying China, Chiang launched five campaigns to eliminate Communist base areas in South China, primarily the Jiangxi Soviet. The fifth campaign succeeded, forcing the Communists on the **Long March** (described as a "Long Rout" where 95% of forces were lost) to Yenan in the north.
*   **Japanese Invasion of Manchuria (1931):** Following Western protectionist tariffs (e.g., Hawley-Smoot), trade-dependent Japan sought autarky through empire, leading to the invasion [[japanese_warfare_strategy_and_tactics_during_world_war_ii | Japanese Warfare Strategy and Tactics During World War II]]. This divided Chiang's attention between the Japanese and the Communists.
*   **Second United Front (December 1936):** Facing increasing Japanese aggression (beyond Manchuria, down the coast, and up the Yangtze River after 1937), the Nationalists and Communists formed a second alliance, brokered during the Xi'an Incident.
*   **Pearl Harbor:** Japan attacked Pearl Harbor to cut Western aid to China, aiming to keep Americans out of Asia. This, along with Nazi Germany's declaration of war on the US, merged regional conflicts into a global World War [[allied_versus_axis_strategies_during_world_war_ii | Allied Versus Axis Strategies During World War II]].

Mao understood he was operating within **nested wars**: a civil war against the Nationalists, within a regional war against Japan, which later became part of a global war and then a Cold War. His pre-Pearl Harbor writings focused on the first two layers. After WWII, the Japanese defeat significantly weakened the Nationalists, allowing Mao to win the resumed civil war.

The concept of **Triangle Building**, borrowed from Clausewitz (who associated passion with the people, creativity with the military, and rationality with the government), was central to Mao's approach. As an insurgent, Mao had to build these institutions and connections from scratch, creating a shadow government to eventually seize power. Many decolonizing nations, particularly agricultural and underdeveloped ones, found Mao's model more relevant than the Soviet one, as Russia had a more established industrial base.

## Framework for Analyzing Mao: Clausewitz's Great Leadership

To understand Mao's theories, a simple framework based on Clausewitz's definition of great leadership is used. Clausewitz identified two indispensable qualities in a general:
1.  **Coup d'oeil:** An intellect that retains "some glimmering of inner light, which leads to truth" even in the darkest hour.
2.  **Determination:** The courage to follow that faint light.

Mao's leadership will be analyzed through four lenses:
1.  Mao the Propagandist
2.  Mao the Social Scientist (data collection and analysis)
3.  Mao the Operational Military Leader
4.  Mao the Grand Strategist

## Mao the Propagandist

Mao began his public service career as a propagandist [[the_psychological_manipulation_and_indoctrination_in_totalitarian_regimes | The Psychological Manipulation and Indoctrination in Totalitarian Regimes]].

### Early Life and Career

Born in 1893 to a prosperous peasant father, Mao disliked farming and left home early. After a brief stint as a soldier post-1911 revolution, he tried various vocational schools (merchant, lawyer, soap maker) before earning an education degree and becoming a primary school principal. He joined the Communist Party and, during the First United Front, also the Nationalist Party, holding key roles such as minute-taker at the KMT central headquarters and acting head of their propaganda department. He believed the Communist Party could "overthrow the enemy only by holding propaganda pamphlets in one hand and bullets in the other". The propaganda department was one of only six in the early shadow Communist government, highlighting its importance.

### Strategic Communication: Messenger, Message, Medium

The analysis uses a framework of messenger, message, and medium.

#### Messengers

Messengers were the Communist Party's delivery system to reach and mobilize the population.
*   **Role:** Identify local grievances for the Party to address, thereby generating loyalty.
*   **Activities:** Identifying local bullies, organizing mass rallies, doubling as medics during battles, propagandizing POWs after battles, and maintaining troop morale between battles. Crucially, they reported back to Communist Central on local conditions.
*   **Civil Messengers:** Activists in local government, labor unions, peasant organizations, women's organizations.
*   **Military Messengers:** Each military unit had a propaganda team of about 20 members. Mao considered the Red Army's propaganda work its "first-priority work".
*   **International Messengers:** Foreign journalists, like Edgar Snow, were crucial. Snow, the first in and last out of Yenan, conducted extensive interviews with Mao. His book, *Red Star Over China*, became a foundational, widely cited source on Mao, effectively getting Mao's message to an international audience.

#### Message

Mao advocated for simple, epigrammatic messages that could be quickly understood, akin to newspaper headlines or modern tweets [[open_source_ai_models_and_their_implications | Open Source AI Models and Their Implications]].
*   **Slogans:** Matching slogans provided a lens for understanding events. Examples: "Arm the peasants" during the White Terror; "Down with imperialism and the Nationalist Party too" after the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria.
*   **Poetry:** Mao, a popular poet, wrote simple couplets accessible to the semi-literate. He also produced complex "grass writing" calligraphy and poetry to appeal to intellectuals, whose support was initially vital. Setting poems to familiar tunes allowed people to learn them by singing.
*   **Managing the Message:** This involved political mobilization, clearly stating policy objectives (e.g., abolishing imperialism, feudalism, and the landlord class), and presenting a strategy to achieve them.

#### Medium

Mao utilized various media:
*   Written and spoken word, dramatic arts.
*   **Education:** This was a key institutional medium.
    *   Mao, the former primary school teacher, understood how to reach the largely illiterate army through political commissars (paired with military commissars, the political ones had a direct line to the secret police).
    *   Social services, including medical care and education for peasant children (a first in Chinese history) and their parents (during the winter slack season), were offered. While Nationalists also tried to improve education, they had to drop it due to fighting the Japanese conventional armies, whereas the guerrilla Communists operating behind enemy lines could continue offering services, making the choice clear for many peasants.
    *   Professional military education was emphasized to transform peasants into cadres, guerrillas, and conventional soldiers, with political work being a core department in institutions like the Northwest Counter-Japan Red Army University [[the_impact_of_design_and_technology_in_education | The Impact of Design and Technology in Education]].

## Mao the Social Scientist

Mao believed, "The peasant problem is the central problem of the national revolution".

### Focus on the Peasant Problem

During the First United Front, Mao headed the Nationalist Party's Peasant Institute in Guangzhou and their Central Commission on the Peasant Movement. After the White Terror, he fled to the Jiangxi Soviet, becoming political commissar of the 4th Army and taking charge of land reform.

### Data-Driven Surveys

Between 1926 and 1933, Mao conducted numerous data-driven surveys to understand rural China: who owned what, who worked for whom, and inventoried resources down to the "last pitchfork and last chicken".
*   **Findings:** He concluded that 6% of the rural population owned 80% of the land, while 80% of the population owned only 20%. His solution was revolution.
*   **Classifications:** He identified 70% as poor peasants, 20% as middle peasants (like his father, tilling their own land), and 10% as exploitative landlords.
*   **Goal:** To incentivize 80% of the people to actively participate in the revolution by mobilizing the bottom of the social pyramid to crush the top.

### Land Reform

This was to be achieved through a **Land Investigation Movement**, described by Mao as "violent and ruthless".
*   **Process:** Involved determining class status, confiscating land, and redistributing it to invert the social pyramid.
*   **Peasant Allegiance:** Land reform was deemed essential for peasant allegiance. It was approached sequentially: propaganda first, then land distribution.
*   **Class Status Approval:** A bureaucratic process, a "life-and-death decision," starting with a local vote, moving through party approval layers, then back to the local level to announce who gets land and who faces execution.
*   **Recruitment:** Enthusiasm from land recipients was leveraged for Party and army recruitment.
*   **Strategic Duplicity:**
    *   The ultimate goal was collectivization, but Mao initially gave peasants land because they "desperately want land," securing their support.
    *   Rich peasants were kept around temporarily because their "production is indispensable" (a deleted portion from collected works) until the civil war was won [[geopolitical_strategies_and_historical_conflicts | Geopolitical Strategies and Historical Conflicts]].
    *   Middle peasants were subject to a "bait and switch"; they received land only to lose it later during collectivization.
*   **Red Terror:** Mao advocated for "red terror" to achieve land reform. His Hunan peasant movement report (while still with Nationalists) detailed taking land from landlords and shooting them—a program the Nationalist army, with its landlord officers, would not tolerate. Coercion was integral to his program.

## Mao the Military Leader

Mao famously stated, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun". His military views were often in the minority initially but were vindicated by events.

### Critics and Their Failed Strategies

*   **Li Lisan:** De facto CCP head (1928-30), advocated taking cities per Moscow's directive. His attempts (Nanchang Uprising 1927, Changsha Uprising 1930) were disastrous. Mao believed Li misunderstood the protracted nature of the Chinese Civil War, trying for decisive battles too early.
*   **Xiang Ying:** Sent by Communist Central (Shanghai) to fire Mao in the Jiangxi Soviet. Mao advocated luring enemies deep into favorable terrain, then annihilating them. Central preferred not ceding territory. Xiang Ying's strategy of defending territory led to the Long March disaster (95% losses), highlighting Mao's foresight.
*   **Zhang Guotao:** Military commissar of the 4th Army, disagreed with Mao's choice of Yenan (near the Soviet border, a key benefactor) as the Long March's terminal point. Zhang preferred Western Sichuan (Han lands), suffered defeats, and eventually defected to the Nationalists.

### Mao vs. Clausewitz on War

*   **Clausewitz:** "War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will."
*   **Mao:** "War is politics by other means... used to achieve political ends." Crucially, Mao added, "A revolution is an uprising, an act of violence whereby one class overthrows the power of another." This class warfare dimension was absent in Clausewitz [[comparisons_between_atomic_bomb_development_and_modern_ai_advancements | Comparisons Between Atomic Bomb Development and Modern AI Advancements]].

Mao saw landlords as the linchpin of the social order and aimed to "detonate" them through peasant-led terror in rural areas, which Nationalists opposed.

### Nested Wars and Defeating Japan

Mao identified three conditions to defeat Japan:
1.  Progress by China (winning the civil war – the primary thing).
2.  Difficulties for Japan (the regional war).
3.  International support (a "big friend") [[sinoindian_and_sinosoviet_relations | Sino-Indian and Sino-Soviet Relations]].

### Civil War Strategy

#### Base Areas (Soviets)

*   **Location:** Often on provincial boundaries, in difficult, defensible terrain beyond easy governmental reach.
*   **Prerequisites:** Strategic terrain, strong Red Army presence, numerous organized workers and peasants (local support), and a good party organization.
*   **Unit Deployment:** Red Army in safe base areas, guerrilla detachments in the interface (guerrilla areas), only small units in enemy territory.
*   **Prerequisites to Fight:** At least two of six conditions met, with active popular support being the most important. Terrain choice was immutable and critical.

#### Strategy of Annihilation

When weak, annihilate one small enemy unit at a time; cumulative effects change the balance of power. Only strong forces can sustain attrition.

#### Triangle Building

Guerrilla detachments operate in the interface. If successful, they could form a new base area or expand an existing one. These groups toughened party members, trained cadres, and consolidated organizations. Success brought in the Red Army for higher-level institution building [[grand_strategy_and_national_power_coordination | Grand Strategy and National Power Coordination]].

#### Two Military Services: Guerrilla vs. Conventional

*   **Guerrilla Forces:** Operate in the enemy's rear, creating instability. They exterminate small enemy forces, weaken larger ones, attack lines of communication, establish bases, and force enemy dispersal, all in coordination with conventional forces.
*   **Conventional Forces:** Mao stressed, "Regular forces are of primary importance because it is they who alone are capable of producing the decision" (winning the war). Guerrilla warfare alone cannot win a war.

#### Fire Escape

A pre-planned terminal point of retreat for base areas if things went wrong (e.g., Yenan for the Long March).

#### Cultivating Allies

Mao assembled an unprecedented coalition:
*   **Peasants:** Won through education, land reform, and strict Red Army discipline (Three Rules, Six Points for Attention, enforced until 1949 to avoid alienating the peasantry).
*   **Women:** Recognizing them as half the population and miserably treated, Mao saw them as natural revolutionaries. He offered them "absolute equality," the right to vote, be elected, and participate in government—far ahead of his time. Women were also crucial for base area building activities when men were fighting.
*   **Minorities:** Offered self-determination, a promise that proved unenforceable after the Communists consolidated power (e.g., Tibetans, Uyghurs).
*   **Enemy Army:** Disintegrated through:
    *   Insinuating agents (workers, peasants, often women operating "below the radar") as soldiers, porters, cooks to erode from within.
    *   Leniency to POWs: Propagandize, recruit the willing, release the unwilling. This contrasted starkly with Nationalist brutality and avoided putting enemies on "death ground" (a Sun Tzu concept where cornered enemies fight desperately).

### Regional War (vs. Japan) Strategy

#### Assessment of China's Characteristics

Mao analyzed China as:
1.  A large, semi-colonial, undeveloped country.
2.  Facing a very strong enemy (Japan).
3.  Having a weak Red Army.
4.  Undergoing an agrarian revolution.
From this, he concluded revolution was possible but would take a long time, necessitating a strategy of **protracted warfare**.

#### Leveraging Japan's Weaknesses

*   Inadequate manpower to garrison vast China, allowing guerrillas to roam behind lines.
*   Brutality and foreignness, naturally pushing the peasantry towards the Communists.
*   Gross underestimation of the Chinese, leading to errors and internal quarrels the Communists could exploit.

#### Three Stages of People's War

This is Mao's most famous paradigm:
1.  **Strategic Defensive (Prevent Defeat):** Focus on peasantry, popular mobilization, base area building, triangle building, guerrilla warfare. Activities from this phase continue throughout.
2.  **Strategic Stalemate/Equilibrium (Transition):** Add mobile warfare, initial attempts at conventional warfare, diplomacy. This phase is dangerous as the insurgency is no longer "under the radar" but in the regime's crosshairs, while still relatively weak. Mao warned against being lured into decisive engagements by the stronger enemy during stages one and two, advocating fighting only when sure of victory.
3.  **Strategic Offensive (Deliver Victory):** Annihilate the enemy army through positional warfare and war-winning battles.

*   **Transitions:**
    *   Phase 1 to 2: Achieved with a critical mass of base areas, cadres, and armed forces.
    *   Phase 2 to 3: Requires a "big friend" (like the Soviet Union) to supply conventional armaments, as underdeveloped countries like China lack the industrial base to produce them [[economic_and_strategic_implications_of_energy_resources | Economic and Strategic Implications of Energy Resources]]. This was why Yenan, near the Soviet border, was crucial.

The People's War theory, while claimed for the war against Japan, actually applied more to the Civil War against the Nationalists. The Nationalists did almost all the conventional fighting against Japan. Mao's one major offensive, the Hundred Regiments Campaign (1940), provoked a devastating Japanese "three alls" campaign (kill all, burn all, loot all) that wiped out many Communist base areas in North China. Mao never tried this again or wrote about the failure [[cold_war_nuclear_weapon_developments_and_global_politics | Cold War Nuclear Weapon Developments and Global Politics]]. While Nationalists fought and were weakened by Japan, the Communists, largely pretending to fight Japan (and later taking credit), focused on rural mobilization and strengthening their own forces for the resumption of the civil war.

## Mao the Grand Strategist

Grand strategy involves linking all elements of national power. Mao's instruments included: the peasantry, propaganda, land reform, base areas, institution building, warfare, and diplomacy. This contrasts with the US military's DIME framework (Diplomacy, Intelligence, Military, Economics), highlighting the need to understand an adversary's unique sources of power.

Mao's **sinification of Marxism** made his ideology more applicable to newly independent, agricultural countries after WWII, positioning him to replace Stalin (d. 1953) as a leading figure in global communism [[comparisons_of_different_regimes_and_the_global_impact_of_maos_policies | Comparisons of Different Regimes and the Global Impact of Mao's Policies]].

### Prescience

Mao demonstrated foresight in:
*   The centrality of the peasantry.
*   The importance of women [[perspectives_on_feminism_and_gender_equality | Perspectives on Feminism and Gender Equality]].
*   The strategic use of minorities and POWs.
*   His military strategy, embodying *coup d'oeil* and determination.
*   Anticipating the stalemate in the Sino-Japanese War and, to an extent, US entry into the war in Asia.

### Concepts for Insurgents (and Counterinsurgents)

Mao developed several enduring concepts useful for insurgencies aiming to take over a "host from within":
*   **Rural Mobilization:** Highly successful in China and by North Vietnam. Less so for North Korea in South Korea, partly due to Syngman Rhee's immediate land reform.
*   **Base Areas:** Used effectively by North Vietnamese. North Korea struggled due to peninsular geography (US Navy cutoff) and cold climate. For Al Qaeda ("the base") or ISIS, Mao's prerequisites (defensible geography, party organization, local support, military forces) remain relevant for analysis.
*   **Luring the Enemy Deep:** Successful in early encirclement campaigns and the final phase of the Civil War (luring Nationalists into Manchuria). Also used against General MacArthur in the Korean War (infiltrating 350,000 troops). This poses a consideration for the US Navy regarding potential traps in the South and East China Seas [[impact_of_cultural_values_on_war_conduct | Impact of Cultural Values on War Conduct]].
*   **Terminal Point of Retreat:** Yenan and Siping worked for Mao. Manchurian cities failed as retreat points for Chiang Kai-shek due to predictable railway access easily cut by Communists. Counterinsurgents should consider where insurgents might go if dislodged.
*   **Disintegrating Enemy Forces:** Seen with the Nationalists (rapid collapse after one defeat in Manchuria in 1948, despite long fighting history), South Vietnamese, and Japan in WWII (surrender without home island invasion). Often occurs after prolonged, ruinous warfare.
*   **Three Stages of People's War:** Can be viewed not just sequentially but as a metric for an insurgency's ebb and flow (e.g., ISIS moving between stages).

### Duality in Mao's Thinking

Mao's writings are replete with dualities, likely influenced by traditional Chinese Yin-Yang philosophy.
*   Triangle building is discussed in terms of presence/absence of factors (e.g., political power, Red Army).
*   Concepts like "defend in order to attack, retreat in order to advance" are common.
*   He advocated "uphold the strategy of a protracted war in a short campaign".
Brigadier General Samuel B. Griffith (translator of Sun Tzu) articulated this as: "In every apparent disadvantage, some advantage is to be found... It is only the wise general... who is able to recognize this fact and turn it to good account". Mao excelled at this. However, in peacetime, choices are graduated, and evolution, not revolution, is more conducive to economic development [[economic_impacts_of_ai_and_automation | Economic Impacts of AI and Automation]].

## Post-Presentation Discussion Insights

### Mao's Shrewdness vs. Great Leap Forward Failures

The apparent contradiction between Mao's early shrewdness and the disastrous Great Leap Forward can be understood through several factors:
*   **Primary Objectives:** Mao's main goals were staying in power, ensuring Communist Party dominance, and furthering his revolutionary vision, not necessarily the immediate welfare of the people.
*   **Flawed Ideology:** The basic communist economic theories being implemented were incorrect.
*   **Limited Individual Expertise:** A successful wartime leader is not automatically a competent peacetime economist (e.g., Winston Churchill voted out post-WWII).
*   **Control:** Communes, while aligning with communist ideology, also served as a powerful mechanism for party control over the vast peasant population by controlling food supply [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | Impact of AI on Future Technology and Society]].
*   **Loss of Situational Awareness:** By the Great Leap Forward, Mao was more isolated. Early successes involved ideas from others (e.g., Peng Dehuai's contributions to "On Guerrilla Warfare"). After the Korean War, Mao purged many, reducing counterarguments and solidifying his "Emperor"-like status.

### Comparison with Stalin

While both caused immense suffering, differences include:
*   **Intentionality of Famines:** Stalin's Holodomor (3 million deaths) was arguably more targeted at eliminating kulaks, whereas the Great Leap Forward's tens of millions of deaths were more a result of disastrous policy.
*   **National Context:** Russia was more developed with more established institutions than China, giving Stalin more tools. China had endured immense devastation from 19th-century peasant rebellions (e.g., Taiping Rebellion, 20-30 million deaths), warlordism, civil war, and Japanese invasion, creating a "massively trashed country" [[the_impact_of_diseases_like_yersinia_pestis_on_historical_population_changes | The Impact of Diseases Like Yersinia Pestis on Historical Population Changes]].

### US Policy Towards China Post-WWII

The discussion touched on whether the US "failed" to adequately support the Nationalists:
*   **Nation-Rebuilding vs. Nation-Building:** The Marshall Plan worked in Germany and Japan because they were rebuilding existing modern institutions. China lacked these, had high illiteracy, and no indigenous expertise for such a rapid transformation.
*   **Contemporary Assessments:** US Foreign Service officers in China at the time (often children of missionaries, fluent in Chinese) largely considered Chiang Kai-shek's cause hopeless due to peasant hatred stemming from KMT practices (dragooning soldiers) versus Communist offerings (land, education).
*   **US Priorities and Resources:** Post-WWII, the US was focused on Europe, fearing Communist takeovers in Italy and France, and had limited resources. Domestic appetite for further engagement in Asia was low.
*   **Marshall's Halt Order (1946):** Some argue that George Marshall advising Chiang to halt his advance into Manchuria when KMT forces were doing well was a critical error. Others counter that Chiang's forces were overextended in a predictable salient. The US mistake was trying to force a coalition between implacable adversaries [[the_role_and_future_of_microsoft_in_the_context_of_global_technological_advancements | The Role and Future of Microsoft in the Context of Global Technological Advancements]].

### Mao's Enduring Power and Legacy

*   **Lack of Insurgency/Coups:** The Communist commissar and party system proved highly effective at seizing and maintaining power, even if it delivered poverty (e.g., North Korea).
*   **Cultural Revolution:** Launched by Mao when he was being sidelined by figures like Liu Shaoqi and Peng Dehuai (who had criticized the Great Leap Forward). Mao rallied the youth (Red Guards) to oust his rivals, which was personally successful for him but ruinous for China.
*   **Contemporary Chinese View of Mao:** Reverence is tied to national pride, Mao's role in ending the "era of humiliations," and the difficulty of confronting a nation's dark history. There's a desire to be proud of leaders despite atrocities. Xi Jinping, despite his family's suffering during the Cultural Revolution, reportedly reveres Mao [[international_perceptions_of_maos_china_and_western_misunderstandings | International Perceptions of Mao's China and Western Misunderstandings]].

### Chiang Kai-shek's Anti-Communism

Chiang initially showed interest in communism (sending his son to study in Russia), but grew to see it as a "disease of the soul," more dangerous than the Japanese ("disease of the flesh"). He preferred to eliminate the Communists before tackling Japan but was forced into the Second United Front by popular pressure.

### Western Journalists and Mao

Edgar Snow's sympathetic portrayal in *Red Star Over China* is attributed to his youth, naivete, and Mao's skillful manipulation. Mao sought a "Jack Reed" figure to popularize his cause internationally. Snow was granted extensive access, shown a curated reality, and his work was subject to Mao's approval. He maintained this narrative, omitting inconvenient truths (like purges of people he knew or the Great Famine), for the rest of his life as it was the basis of his importance.

AI progress forecasting is a challenging and often speculative field that attempts to predict the development trajectory of artificial intelligence technologies. In a recent discussion, Scott Alexander and Daniel Kokotajlo delved into their ambitious project "AI 2027," which serves as an illustrative forecast of AI advancements leading up to the year 2027. This article explores key insights and methodologies associated with AI forecasting as explained by the two thinkers.

## AI 2027: The Forecast Project

AI 2027 is a scenario-building exercise designed to project the advancements of AI over the next few years. As Alexander explains, the initiative seeks to provide a concrete narrative to bridge the gap between the current state of AI and the anticipated emergence of [[challenges_and_considerations_for_achieving_agi | artificial general intelligence (AGI)]] by 2027, and possibly superintelligence by 2028 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The project involves crafting a month-by-month story that not only imagines the technological breakthroughs but also aims for accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Methodologies and Challenges

### Forecasting Speed and Scenarios

The AI 2027 project uses historical data, current AI research trends, and expert forecasts to model potential timelines of AI development. Alexander notes the challenges in forecasting AI progress, as the most common outcome tends to be "total humiliation" when things do not unfold as predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, Kokotajlo points to the success of his previous forecast, "What 2026 Looks Like," which he claims held up remarkably well [[ai_scaling_and_its_effectiveness | considering the scale and effectiveness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Potential Outcomes and Transitional Effects

AI forecasts often include outlining potential outcomes and the transitional technologies leading to major advances. Kokotajlo discusses how gradual improvements in coding and agency training could lead to significant capabilities by 2027, emphasizing the role of what he calls the "R&D progress multiplier," a concept that quantifies the acceleration in research progress due to AI assistance [[role_and_impact_of_reinforcement_learning_with_human_feedback_rlhf | through innovative methods such as RLHF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Key Concepts in AI Forecasting

### Intelligence Explosion

A significant focus of the AI 2027 scenario is the concept of the "intelligence explosion," where AI systems themselves contribute to accelerating their development. Kokotajlo and Alexander explore how [[intelligence_explosion_and_ai_progress | AI agents could progressively take over]] aspects of AI research and development, leading to rapid advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Factors Influencing AI Progress

The dialogue highlights several factors that could influence AI progress, including computational power, data availability, algorithmic advancements, and [[us_and_china_competition_in_ai_development | ecosystem dynamics such as competition among AI labs]] and geopolitical considerations. Alexander stresses the importance of these elements by referencing previous historical transitions like the [[geopolitical_strategies_during_the_cold_war | industrial and agricultural revolutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

## Challenges to AI Forecasting

### Overcoming Skepticism and Bias

Despite tools like Metaculus providing aggregate AI timelines, the discourse makes it clear that many still underestimate the pace of AI advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Kokotajlo argues that while there's a tendency towards pessimism, the unprecedented nature of AI progress requires [[challenges_in_modeling_and_predicting_ai_timelines | agile updating of predictions]] and openness to rapid changes.

### Balancing Technical Improvements and Human Policy

One of the most pronounced aspects of forecasting is balancing anticipated technical improvements with likely human response, such as policy and governance adjustments. The discussion broaches the difficulty of predicting how different stakeholders (e.g., governments, companies) might react to transformative AI [[societal_and_governmental_response_to_ai_risks | considering the societal and governmental responses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.

> [!info] Conclusion
>
> AI progress forecasting encompasses constructing plausible scenarios, evaluating technological capabilities, and predicting human behavioral responses. It combines both technical insight and speculative vision to map out the potential future landscape of AI, as evidenced by Scott Alexander and Daniel Kokotajlo's AI 2027 project. As forecasts can be inherently uncertain, ongoing dialogue and scenario updates are crucial for refining expectations and strategies for AI development.

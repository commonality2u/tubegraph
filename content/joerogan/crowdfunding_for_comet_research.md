The fascinating and potentially life-saving field of comet research is gaining significant attention, thanks primarily to the efforts of the [[comet_impacts_and_extinction_events | Comet Research Group]] as well as the support of voices like Graham Hancock. This dedicated group of scientists is exploring the profound impact comets have had on Earth's history as well as the future risks they might pose. 

## The Comet Research Group

The Comet Research Group is composed of major, highly credentialed scientists who have devoted the last decade to studying the extraordinary story of a series of [[comet_impacts_and_global_cataclysms | comet impacts]] on the North American ice cap 12,800 years ago. This event is believed to have been a [[impact_of_comets_on_earth_and_civilizations | global cataclysm]] that wiped out a significant portion of prehistorical civilization. The group's work aims to shed light on these past events, thus expanding our understanding of the Earth's history and possibly its future.

## The Role of Crowdfunding

Due to persistent skepticism and opposition from some quarters of the scientific community, largely because of vested interests in competing theories, the Comet Research Group has struggled to secure official funding for their groundbreaking research. This is where crowdfunding comes into play. Inspired by Graham Hancock’s appearances on platforms such as the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the group launched a crowdfunding campaign to gain the resources needed to expand their research efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## How the Funding Helps

The resources gathered from crowdfunding are being used for extensive fieldwork and further research. This includes returning to Greenland to search for evidence of nano-diamonds in the ice cores, which provide critical evidence of past comet impacts. There are also plans to investigate ancient city sites, which researchers suspect were wiped out by comet impacts approximately 4,500 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## The Big Picture

The Earth has been hit by a multitude of large cosmic objects, but these events are rarely discussed in the mainstream. Giant comets from the [[comet_impacts_and_global_cataclysms | torrid meteor stream]] pose an ongoing threat, as evidenced by significant impacts such as the Chelyabinsk meteor in 2013. Heightening awareness and increasing scientific funding through public support can help make it possible to prevent or mitigate the impact of future strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>.

## Call to Action

The effort to understand and prepare for potential cosmic threats is a prudent and rational action for the well-being of the human species. Through public support and involvement, the Comet Research Group hopes to elevate the significance of these studies, thus influencing public policy and enhancing scientific preparedness. Enthusiasts and citizens who wish to support this cause can visit Graham Hancock’s website to access the fundraising platform and contribute to this crucial research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:19">[03:36:19]</a>.

The discussion of prehistoric civilizations often brings to the forefront the ideas of prominent writers and researchers such as [[lost_civilizations_and_graham_hancocks_theories | Graham Hancock]]. Hancock is well-known for his books and theories that challenge conventional historians and archaeologists by proposing the existence of a lost civilization that predates known ancient cultures.

## Theories of a Lost Civilization

In his seminal work, *Fingerprints of the Gods*, published in 1995, Hancock propounds the idea that an advanced civilization existed thousands of years before the recognized emergence of modern civilizations. He suggests that a cataclysm, possibly triggered by asteroidal impacts or other [[cataclysmic_events_and_ancient_history | cataclysmic events]], obliterated this civilization, erasing much of its evidence from the Earth's surface. Hancock's theories draw heavily on the apparent lack of concrete evidence, such as pottery and carvings, suggesting that such artifacts were lost due to these catastrophic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Landscape of Catastrophes

Randall Carlson, a geologist who often collaborates with Hancock, mentions taking Hancock on a tour of what he terms "Landscapes of Catastrophe" as part of research for Hancock's sequel to *Fingerprints of the Gods*. This trip underscores Hancock's theory: landscapes across the globe bear marks of cataclysmic events, possibly supporting the idea of a sophisticated civilization that was erased from history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Cataclysmic Events and Geological Evidence

Carlson emphasizes the dramatic geological changes that occurred 11,000 to 14,000 years ago, a period he refers to as "deep history." Rapid climate fluctuations, colossal melting of glaciers, and rising sea levels reshaped Earth dramatically, supporting Hancock's assertions of periodic cataclysmic events that could erase civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Archaeological Discoveries and Hancock’s Theories

Significant archaeological finds, such as those at Göbekli Tepe and Gunung Padang, noted for their construction dates around 11,000 to 12,000 years ago, bolster Hancock's theories. These sites may serve as evidence for his claims of a sophisticated society predating known ancient civilizations. Hancock argues that these structures, deliberately buried and yet only partially excavated, could indicate a civilization's attempt to preserve its knowledge from impending disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## The Age of Catastrophes and Rebooting of Civilization

Hancock and Carlson draw connections between the geological evidence of worldwide cataclysms and the oral traditions that have survived as myths and legends. They suggest that modern civilization is not the outset of human advancement but rather a "reboot" of a civilization that existed before these global disasters. This reboot theory posits that the cultural and technological advancements we trace to around 9,000 years ago are the remnants of older knowledge coming back into human consciousness after a period of dormancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

Through collaborative efforts with researchers like Carlson, Graham Hancock continues to challenge the academic community by proposing and reinforcing theories of lost civilizations with geological, archaeological, and cultural evidence. His work encourages the reevaluation of human history and the potential of ancient civilizations' impact on our understanding of the past.

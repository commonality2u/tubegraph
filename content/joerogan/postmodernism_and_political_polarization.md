In recent years, the term postmodernism has gained traction, particularly in discussions surrounding political and societal dynamics. Postmodernism, a complex and often controversial philosophical movement, is intricately linked to the growing phenomenon of political polarization. 

## Understanding Postmodernism in Modern Context

Postmodernism challenges traditional narratives and ideologies, presenting a worldview where objective truths are subjective and ever-changing. This philosophical approach argues that the social constructs we rely on, such as language, identity, and cultural norms, are all fluid and open to interpretation. It posits that absolute truths are illusions and embraces the idea of multiple realities coexisting simultaneously [00:03:00].

Bret Weinstein highlights that one of the core tenets of postmodernism being taught in universities is the idea that "there's nothing but power" mediating relationships between people. This notion is founded on the belief that all relationships are power dynamics, dismissing the existence of a real world and viewing everything as a landscape of conflict between groups. Postmodernism emphasizes power as the sole means of expression, leading to a cynical perspective that justifies the arbitrary use of power under any circumstances [00:04:00].

## Postmodernism's Role in Political Polarization

Postmodernism's rejection of universal truths can exacerbate political polarization by encouraging radical skepticism and undermining cohesive narratives. This skepticism towards objective reality creates an environment where political discourse becomes less about finding common ground and more about asserting fragmented, subjective truths.

Jordan Peterson argues that postmodernism leads to a disregard for the foundations of Western society, such as individualism. He suggests that postmodernism and its offspring—the radical left—threaten societal stability. This threat arises from postmodernism's challenge to the core tenets of enlightenment thought, which have historically underpinned democratic and liberal societies [00:10:00].

The postmodern perspective is often married to neo-Marxist ideologies, transforming the struggle between oppressors and the oppressed into a lens through which all social issues are viewed. This perspective contributes to moral absolutism where dissent is often viewed as morally reprehensible rather than a point of debate [01:55:00].

## Universities as Hotbeds for Postmodern Ideology

The academic landscape, particularly in the social sciences and humanities, has seen a significant shift towards postmodern ideologies. Many educators and institutions are seen as promoting perspectives that align with postmodernist doctrines. This tilt has contributed to an environment that stifles debate and promotes an echo chamber effect, further driving political polarization [01:58:00].

The imbalance in academia has been attributed to hiring practices that favor left-leaning ideologies, resulting in a feedback loop where only similar perspectives are represented and reinforced. Jordan Peterson and Bret Weinstein emphasize that such an environment inhibits true scholarly inquiry and impedes the university's role as a marketplace of ideas [01:58:00].

## Consequences and Solutions

The fusion of postmodern and Marxist thought has led to societal tensions, creating a divide where dialogue becomes challenging. Instead of fostering an environment for open discourse, this combination promotes an adversarial climate where ideological purity is pursued at the expense of nuanced discussion.

Peterson and Weinstein contend that the solution lies in re-emphasizing the importance of individual responsibility and the value of free speech as means to bridge divides and create a more cohesive society. By fostering environments where diverse viewpoints can coexist and be challenged, the destabilizing effects of political polarization can be mitigated [02:00:00].

From: [[joerogan]] <br/> 

In the narrative of Bob Lazar, Element 115 holds a special position due to its alleged properties and potential applications in advanced propulsion systems and possibly other technologies. Lazar claims that during his time working in a secretive government project, he encountered use of Element 115, which was critical for the operation of extraterrestrial technology, specifically for manipulating gravity waves which allow for advanced propulsion technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.

## The Discovery and Characteristics of Element 115

Element 115, known as Moscovium in the periodic table, was not officially recognized until it was first synthesized in a lab in 2003 by a team of Russian and American scientists. The few atoms created lasted only milliseconds before decaying, indicating that Moscovium's most stable isotope is still highly unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

> The first successful synthesis of Element 115 occurred at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. They observed its decay, which formed heavier elements like berkelium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

## Bob Lazar's Claims About Element 115

Lazar's account places Element 115 as a stable element with properties unknown to modern science. He claims that this element was used as fuel for the propulsion systems of alien crafts, generating gravitational waves and thus enabling these crafts to perform maneuvers that defy typical aeronautical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. According to Lazar, this element was not only stable in the environment in which he worked, but also integral for the negative gravity propulsion engines of the craft he studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Applications in Propulsion

In terms of propulsion, Lazar described this technology as capable of creating its own gravitational field, much like how electromagnetic fields are produced by electromagnets. This gravitational manipulation theoretically allows for bending space-time, offering an explanation for how these crafts could seemingly violate the speed of light limitation and perform rapid movements without concern for g-forces on occupants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Scientific Scrutiny and Skepticism

The scientific community remains skeptical about these claims, primarily due to the instability observed in Earth-based synthesized isotopes of Element 115. Critics of Lazar’s story question the feasibility of Element 115 as a stable element in any natural form different from the isotopes synthesized on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

Moreover, the concept of using exotic elements as a fuel source for spacecraft propulsion has not been replicated or evidenced in any other acknowledged scientific research or project currently known to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Potential Implications and Conclusions

If Lazar's claims about Element 115 and its properties were to be true, such a discovery would imply significant advancements in energy production, propulsion technology, and potentially even time manipulation. However, without further empirical evidence and validation through scientific procedures, these remain speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:14">[01:22:14]</a>.

The discussion around Element 115, made notable by Lazar’s testimony, continues to fascinate enthusiasts and generate discussions in the fields of advanced theoretical physics and extraterrestrial life inquiries. How this element fits into the broader category of research into [[the_nature_and_implications_of_advanced_propulsion_systems | advanced propulsion systems]] continues to pique the interest of those intrigued by the potential existence and reverse engineering of otherworldly technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.

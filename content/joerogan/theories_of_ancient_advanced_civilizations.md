Theories regarding ancient advanced civilizations have long intrigued those fascinated by the mysteries of our past. Prominent figures like [[graham_hancocks_theories_and_prehistoric_civilizations | Graham Hancock]] have explored these ideas extensively, proposing scenarios that challenge mainstream historical narratives. In this article, we'll explore the claims and evidence surrounding the potential existence of sophisticated societies in prehistoric times, particularly focusing on global cataclysmic events and the historical impact they may have had.

## Cataclysmic Events and Lost Civilizations

One of the core components of theories about ancient advanced civilizations is the impact of cataclysmic events on our historical trajectory. Hancock posits that between 12,800 and 11,600 years ago, North America - and indeed the world - was at the epicenter of a significant [[cataclysmic_events_and_ancient_history | cataclysmic event]] involving catastrophic flooding and comet impacts. This is said to have caused dramatic changes in the global climate, as well as massive extinctions among large mammals and potentially humans themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Evidence of Ancient Floods

In a research trip across the Channel Scablands of Washington State, evidence was presented of irrefutable cataclysmic flooding. This visit illuminated massive currents flowing from the melting ice sheets, which were so immense that they left behind large geological formations like The Kamas Prairie's 50-foot high ripples, indicative of gigantic receding floodwaters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. These floods are believed to have been triggered by impacts from fragments of a giant comet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## The Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis

The Younger Dryas impact hypothesis suggests that during the period 12,800 to 11,600 years ago, pieces of a disintegrating comet struck the Earth, dramatically altering the climate and catalyzing the collapse of existing ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. This proposal supports the notion that any advanced civilization at that time would have been wiped out or severely disrupted.

## Megalithic Structures and Lost Knowledge

As new archaeological findings surface, such as GÃ¶bekli Tepe in Turkey, where giant megaliths have been dated to around 11,600 years ago, assumptions about the beginnings of civilization are being contested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Similar advanced structures in other parts of the world, such as the submerged site found underwater in the Sicily Channel, estimated to be at least 10,000 years old, suggest a level of sophistication previously unattributed to ancient peoples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

## Recovering Lost History and Technology

These findings imply that mainstream archaeology has underestimated the complexity of early human societies. Hancock argues that this new evidence requires a reevaluation of our understanding of human history to include the possibility of previous advanced civilizations that might have mastered astronomy and megalithic engineering long before recorded history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

## Cultural Memory and Mythology

Theories of ancient advanced civilizations often delve into how myth and tradition preserve the memory of these lost societies. Myths of global floods and fears of comets found in cultures across the globe might represent cultural echoes of these cataclysmic events. Hancock asserts that these stories encode real events experienced by ancestors, passed down through generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.

Understanding the theories of ancient advanced civilizations invites us to rewrite parts of our historical narrative and consider the factors that may have led to the rise and fall of previous societies. This ongoing inquiry not only challenges established thinking but enriches our comprehension of humanity's epic journey through the eons.

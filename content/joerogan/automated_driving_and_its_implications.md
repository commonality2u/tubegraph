Automated driving technology is poised to revolutionize transportation over the next century, bringing about significant changes in how society approaches vehicle use and road safety. As technology progresses, the conversation around automated vehicles touches on various aspects of control, safety, economics, and societal impacts.

## The Transition to Automated Driving

In the next 100 years, it is expected that automated driving will become mandatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37">[06:37]</a>. This transition is driven by the potential to significantly reduce or even eliminate vehicle crashes and highway fatalities. By removing human error from driving, autonomous vehicles promise to enhance safety on the roads.

## Safety and Control

The control over vehicles will transform with the advent of automated systems. No longer will individuals have personal control over their vehicles, but instead, vehicles will operate under a systemized network that can intervene as needed. This includes the ability of authorities to remotely control or disable vehicles to prevent chases or stop vehicles during emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26">[06:26]</a>. Such control raises questions about privacy and autonomy, as individuals might need to relinquish some freedoms in exchange for safety and security.

## Economic and Practical Considerations

Automated driving also presents considerations around economic impacts and convenience. Financial benefits are often promoted to encourage public acceptance of such technologies. However, the technological and infrastructural investments required to support autonomous vehicles are significant. The technology's implementation will likely come with practical reasons to encourage subscription and compliance, such as reduced insurance costs and increased safety for all road users.

## A Step Towards Futuristic Technology

The progression towards a fully automated driving environment can be seen as part of a broader trend towards [[future_of_technology_and_society_with_ai_and_robotics | adopting technology]] for societal improvement. Automated driving aligns with the goals of creating safer, interconnected, and more efficient urban landscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55">[03:55]</a>.

## Unintended Consequences and Speculations

While the potential benefits of automated driving are prominent, there are also speculations and concerns regarding its implementation. For instance, such technology could be misused for control or surveillance, as vehicles could be tracked and managed remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26">[06:26]</a>. Moreover, transitioning to automated systems involves overcoming significant technical and ethical hurdles.

## Conclusion

Automated driving technology marks a significant leap in [[perspectives_on_groundbreaking_technology_in_transportation_and_communication | transportation technology]], promising considerable benefits in safety and efficiency. However, as it becomes more prevalent, it is crucial to navigate the challenges it presents thoughtfully, balancing safety, personal freedom, and societal needs. Such advancements promise a future where technology takes the wheel, transforming our experiences and interactions with vehicles and transportation systems.

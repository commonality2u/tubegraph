The exploration of ancient civilizations in the Americas has revealed a complex history suggesting a significant human presence long before the traditionally accepted timelines. Recent archaeological discoveries and scientific evidence are challenging long-held assumptions about the peopling and early cultures of the American continents.

## Ancient Civilizations of the Americas

Graham Hancock, a prominent author, has long been at the forefront of discussing [[lost_civilizations_and_archaeology | lost civilizations]]. His work has brought significant attention to an earlier chapter in human history that may have existed in the Americas before known history.

## Evidence of Human Activity

The concept of [[lost_civilizations_and_graham_hancocks_theories | unexplored archaeological layers]] under the surface has been gaining traction due to discoveries such as the Clovis culture and other pre-Clovis findings. Scientists increasingly suggest that human presence in the Americas could date back as far as 130,000 years, based on evidence like the discoveries at Cerutti Mastodon site and Topper site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

### Clovis and Beyond

For decades, the "Clovis first" model stated that the earliest inhabitants of the Americas arrived around 13,400 years ago. However, this perspective has gradually shifted due to significant archaeological findings that predate Clovis sites. Notably, the work of scientists at the Topper site in South Carolina has found artifacts dated to more than 50,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Discoveries in the Amazon

Recent archaeological work in the Amazon Basin has revealed evidence of [[theories_of_ancient_advanced_civilizations | advanced ancient civilizations]], including the creation of terra preta, a fertile man-made soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. This suggests sophisticated agricultural practices, enabling large populations to thrive in otherwise challenging environments.

Additionally, geoglyphs and henge-like structures within the Amazon offer hints of organized societies with complex geometrical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

## Connections Across Continents

Hancock's exploration also highlights genetic evidence linking populations in the Amazon to those in Australasia, suggesting potential prehistoric trans-oceanic contact. Richard Skell Willerslev of the University of Copenhagen noted that groups might have traversed the Pacific Ocean during the last ice age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>.

## Cataclysmic Events and Civilization Collapse

The [[cataclysmic_events_and_ancient_history | Younger Dryas impact hypothesis]] posits that cataclysmic comet events occurred around 12,800 years ago, drastically altering Earth's climate and possibly eradicating a [[graham_hancocks_theories_and_prehistoric_civilizations | prehistoric civilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00">[09:00]</a>.

This period saw rapid changes, including mass extinctions and a severe drop in temperatures, supporting Hancock's theory of a significant reset in human civilization that may have occurred due to such a catastrophic event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08">[12:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

The ongoing research and discoveries in the Americas are reshaping the understanding of ancient human history on the continents. Hancock's work underscores the need for a greater focus on regions like the Amazon, where untapped archaeological treasures await exploration. As more evidence comes to light, the history of ancient civilizations in the Americas continues to be rewritten, offering tantalizing glimpses of forgotten chapters in human history.

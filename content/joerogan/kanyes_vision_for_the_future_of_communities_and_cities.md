## Introduction
In a lengthy discussion about his ambitions and ideas, [[kanye_wests_presidential_run | Kanye West]] articulates his vision for designing future communities and cities. His approach combines elements of innovation, spirituality, and a holistic understanding of human needs in an effort to redefine how communities are structured.

## The Philosophy Behind the Vision
Kanye believes that modern cities have been designed predominantly around industrial efficiency rather than prioritizing human happiness and well-being. He argues that this has led to a societal structure that keeps the wealthy in power and the poor in cycles of poverty, as highlighted during his discourse on wider societal issues.

> There's this paradigm shift in our existence. Cities have been designed to promote industry and just to make more money; they haven't been designed to promote happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10">[34:10]</a>.

Kanye emphasizes the importance of returning to a more balanced and spiritually guided way of living, which he believes can be achieved by redesigning our environments and societal frameworks.

## Key Components of the Vision

### Sustainable Design and Resources
At the heart of Kanye's vision is sustainability. He advocates for communities that are self-sufficient in terms of food, energy, and shelterâ€”a stark contrast to current dependency on external sources. He is inspired by the potential of innovations in [[perspectives_on_groundbreaking_technology_in_transportation_and_communication | groundbreaking technology]] and believes that the adoption of such technology is crucial.

> The future communities should fully integrate innovative practices in food production, energy use, and transport systems, ensuring self-sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00">[32:00]</a>.

### Harmonious Living
Kanye envisions communities where the design harmonizes with human life and vibrations, reflecting his spiritual and [[kanyes_thoughts_on_religion_and_spirituality | religious views]]. Structures should encourage harmonious living, blending aesthetic and natural elements that promote health and well-being.

> The homes and communities will resemble a more fluid, organic structure, inspired by the natural landscape and harmonious to live in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05">[17:05]</a>.

### Integration of Arts and Humanities
Reflecting his background in the creative arts, Kanye stresses the role of artists in designing spaces. He believes that art should be central to community design, bringing together aesthetics with functionality to enrich the human experience.

> Art and creativity must be central in building cities; they're what define cultures and set the standard for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20">[14:20]</a>.

### Education and Communal Living
The vision extends to innovative education systems that go beyond traditional curriculums, focusing on physics, farming, and other practical skills. Kanye imagines a future where children are educated in a way that prepares them not only professionally but also spiritually and communally.

> The schools will focus on what children really need to learn and will bring them closer to nature and sustainable living practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00">[31:00]</a>.

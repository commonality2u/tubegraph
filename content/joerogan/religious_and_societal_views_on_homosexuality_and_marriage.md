The conversation between Joe Rogan and [[skepticism_and_views_on_religion | Ben Shapiro]] delves into complex topics related to religious and societal perspectives on homosexuality and marriage. The discussion sheds light on the interplay of religious beliefs, societal norms, and personal freedoms, while highlighting the nuances in these controversial and sensitive subjects.

## Religious Perspectives

### Judaism and Sexual Orientation

From an [[skepticism_and_views_on_religion | Orthodox Jewish]] standpoint, Shapiro illustrates the religious teachings that separate biological drives from the actions one ought to take. In Judaism, it is not the biological drive or orientation that is considered sinful but rather the actions that contradict religious commandments. Shapiro emphasizes that within Judaism, the focus is on the activity: acting on homosexual inclinations is considered a violation of religious law. This traditional stance is informed by the scripture which prohibits certain activities, not the mere existence of inclination or orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.

### Broader Religious Context

Shapiro articulates that many religions, including Christianity, feature commandments that emphasize restraint and self-control over oneâ€™s desires, whatever those desires may be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>. The challenges faced by individuals who identify as homosexual are seen as personal challenges to be managed within the framework of their faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:40">[02:14:40]</a>.

## Societal and Legal Views

### Secular Perspective on Marriage

In the secular view, particularly in the context of the United States, legal recognition and rights associated with marriage are crucial. Shapiro acknowledges a shift from understanding marriage as purely for producing and rearing children to recognizing marriage as a loving union between two people, which has broadened societal acceptance of same-sex marriages. Though from a religious perspective he may value traditional marriage, he supports the legal rights of individuals to engage in same-sex marriage without government intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>.

### Freedom and Plurality

The conversation brings to light the nuances of living in a pluralistic society where freedom should allow individuals to make choices according to their beliefs, as long as they do not harm others. Shapiro posits that it should not be his responsibility to police or approve of people's personal behaviors that do not affect him, advocating for personal freedom and reduced government involvement in personal choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:58">[02:10:58]</a>.

## Cultural Insights

### Identity and Activity

Joe Rogan challenges the traditional views with the perspective that homosexuality is not simply an activity or choice but a core part of one's identity. The discussion underscores the tension between religious doctrines and the acceptance and affirmation of diverse identities in the modern age. This conversation brings to the forefront the compatibility of personal truths with societal norms and the search for individual validation and acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:07">[02:14:07]</a>.

### Community and Acceptance

A recurrent theme is the balance between personal beliefs and community acceptance. Shapiro argues that while he interprets religious texts in a traditional way, it does not stop him from engaging with and supporting people in different communities, such as being friends with individuals like [[discussing_relationships_and_marriage | Dave Rubin]], a married gay man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>.

**Leah Remini** has been a prominent figure for her outspoken critiques of the Church of Scientology. Her journey out of the church, which she was once deeply involved with, represents a profound personal transition towards rediscovering her individual identity and beliefs.

## Early Life and Involvement in Scientology

Remini was introduced to Scientology at the age of nine when her mother joined the church. From this young age, Leah was enveloped in its teachings, believing wholeheartedly in its principles and the mission to "save mankind" and clear the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The church's tenets became the foundation of her life's mission, offering her a sense of purpose and importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Life Within Scientology

Living under the jurisdiction of the [[the_role_of_celebrities_in_scientology_and_the_influence_within_the_church | Scientology]], Remini engaged in rigorous study and practice, contributing both time and a significant amount of money to the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. Her belief in its mission was unwavering, even though it required self-brainwashing and adhering strictly to the policies dictated by L. Ron Hubbard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:46">[02:08:46]</a>.

These sessions required a daily commitment and involved regimens including reading policies and using the E-meter to investigate her "reactive mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.

## The Journey Out

Leah's skepticism grew over time, triggered by events like the disappearance of Church leader David Miscavige's wife, which led to discrepancies and questions within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>. Her investigations into the internet's reports revealed abuses and discrepancies that the church could not satisfyingly address, leading to a prolonged sense of disillusionment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>.

Her eventual decision to leave was not the result of a single event but an accumulation of experiences and revelations, taking over six years to fully unravel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>. Despite significant pressure and the church's attempts to hold her by labeling her a "suppressible person," she managed to break free from the grips of the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:41">[01:54:41]</a>.

## Redefining Personal Identity

Leah's exit from Scientology marked the beginning of a transformative period in her life. Free from the confines of the church, she embarked on a journey to rediscover her own beliefs and self-identity. She began therapy, which was a completely new experience, allowing her to explore her thoughts and emotions without the groundwork laid by Scientology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:07">[01:59:07]</a>.

This path included re-evaluating lessons and internal narratives developed over her years in Scientology and attempting to form her convictions and beliefs based on personal truths rather than institutional ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:53">[01:29:53]</a>.

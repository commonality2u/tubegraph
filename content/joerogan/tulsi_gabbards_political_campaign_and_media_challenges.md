## Introduction

Tulsi Gabbard, a prominent political figure and a veteran, gained significant attention for her bold stances and unique position within the political landscape. Known for her advocacy for anti-establishment policies and an emphasis on direct voter engagement, Gabbard has faced numerous challenges from within her party and the media. Her campaign's focus on transparency and her direct approach have both catalyzed support and sparked substantial controversy.

## Campaign Background

Gabbard's campaign is markedly defined by its independence from corporate political action committees (PACs) and lobbyists. Instead, it relies heavily on contributions from individual supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This approach underscores her commitment to a campaign that prioritizes the interests of the American people over entrenched political interests.

### Political Stances

Gabbard's platform is built on challenging the status quo, with a sharp critique of the United States' interventionist foreign policy. She has consistently called for the cessation of regime change wars, emphasizing the destructive impact they have on both the United States' and global stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. Her stance on non-interventionism differentiates her from many mainstream politicians, appealing to a diverse coalition of Democrats, Republicans, and independents.

## Media Challenges

### Misinformation and Media Narratives

Gabbard has been a vocal critic of the media, particularly its role in perpetuating biased narratives. She has frequently been the target of misinformation, including unfounded accusations of being a Russian asset, which have been propagated by prominent political figures such as Hillary Clinton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:08">[01:44:08]</a>. The labeling of Gabbard as an Assad supporter and other misleading narratives have negatively impacted her public perception, creating a significant hurdle for her campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

### Influence of Big Tech

In a notable incident, Gabbard's Google ad account was suspended during a critical time in her campaign without clear explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:33">[01:32:33]</a>. This led to a lawsuit against Google, underscoring the outsized influence tech giants can wield over political campaigns.

This approach is part of a broader trend in modern political campaigns, reflecting the significant [[role_of_social_media_in_political_discourse]].

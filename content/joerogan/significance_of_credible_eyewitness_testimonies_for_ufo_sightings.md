The exploration of unidentified flying objects ([[the_exploration_of_potential_ufo_and_alien_encounters]]) has captivated the imagination of many for decades. The incident involving Commander David Fravor in 2004, often referred to as the "Tic Tac UFO" encounter, elevated the discourse surrounding UFO sightings due to the credibility of the source.

## The Credible Testimony of Commander David Fravor

Commander David Fravor, a seasoned military pilot with over 24 years of experience, provided a testimony about an encounter with a UFO that defied the known limits of aerodynamics. This encounter occurred on November 14, 2004, off the coast of California and involved multiple radar systems aboard the USS Princeton tracking unidentified objects descending from 80,000 feet to 20,000 feet, and then disappearing only to reappear elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Why Commander Fravor's Testimony Matters

Commander Fravor's testimony holds substantial weight due to several factors:

The Legends Only League is an innovative concept founded by former heavyweight champion, Mike Tyson, aimed at reviving the competitive spirits of legendary athletes from various sports and providing a platform for them to showcase their skills once more. This initiative is not just about competition but also about creating a nostalgic experience for audiences and giving athletes an opportunity to demonstrate their lasting prowess.

## Origins and Vision

The idea of the Legends Only League was birthed as a collaboration between Mike Tyson and business partners such as Eros Innovations. Tyson, who has always been an iconic figure in the boxing world, saw the potential to create something unique – a league that would not only entertain but also inspire and invigorate retired athletes who still have the passion and capability to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

The league's debut was marked by Tyson's highly anticipated exhibition bout against Roy Jones Jr., planned for November 28th, 2020.

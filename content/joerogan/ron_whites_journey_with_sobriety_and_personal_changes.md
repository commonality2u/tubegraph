Ron White, a well-known stand-up comedian, has undergone several personal changes, especially during the COVID-19 lockdown. This period marked significant moments in his life, notably his attempt at moderating his alcohol consumption rather than pursuing complete sobriety. White humorously refers to this initiative as the "dial it back a little bit" program, which includes steps aimed not at getting completely sober, but reducing excessive drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Six-Step Program

White began this journey by addressing his consumption habits, such as reducing his intake from half a bottle of tequila a night to something more manageable like a third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This lighter approach to sobriety reflects his characteristic comedic style while addressing a personal issue.

## Life in Austin and the Impact of COVID-19

During the lockdown, White relocated to Austin, a city he has been familiar with since he was 15. This move coincided with his evolving lifestyle and his comedic career put on hold due to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The pandemic had a profound impact on his performances, with live shows being canceled and a significant shift in his career trajectory, leading him to consider retirement from stand-up comedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the way humans interact. The imposition of lockdowns and the practice of social distancing have had profound effects on human contact and social behaviors. This article explores the impact of these changes during the early stages of the pandemic, focusing on human touch, social behaviors, and the psychological implications of long-term isolation.

## Changes in Social Behaviors

The pandemic introduced a new normal where common social practices were reevaluated. The necessity to maintain distance altered fundamental human interactions. For instance, people became wary of approaching each other:

> "It's crazy to see another human being. Everyone's across the street, hi, and I'm a hugger, right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>

In this context, physical touch, a critical component of human interaction and communication, was minimized. Huggers faced an internal conflict, as innate instincts are suppressed by external circumstances:

> "I'm a hugger in California, and all of my instincts are wrong. Everything's all messed up. Everyone's confused." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

## Impact on Human Connection

The lack of physical touch led to a metaphorical starvation for human contact:

> "The ideas were also starved for touch. We're gonna have a Jubilee like you've never seen. People are gonna greet each other with tongues who are almost like just acquaintances." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>

These sentiments highlight an emotional and psychological need for interaction that was starkly unfulfilled during lockdowns, leading to a significant longing for connection once restrictions were lifted.

## Psychological Effects of Isolation

Psychologically, the impact of social distancing and lockdowns created a state of confusion and distress among people. The stress of isolation, coupled with the fear of the virus, exacerbated mental health issues:

> "Everybody's losing their [\h__\h]. They definitely are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>

The health autarky further extended beyond physical health safeguards, affecting mental well-being due to the lack of normal social contact and routine human behavior, raising concerns about each personâ€™s psychological resilience in isolation.

## Fear and Preparedness

The pandemic lockdown also highlighted the extent of global unpreparedness for such a public health crisis. It revealed systemic weaknesses in leadership and a lack of preparedness, as people navigated through a world where simple social acts had become potential health risks:

> "It's good to remember also that this stuff is live and real and it has always been live and real." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>

Moreover, preparedness became a focal point as different regions and their differing responses implicitly called for an evaluation of the adequacy of their health safeguards and the truthfulness of official narratives amid emergent scientific and health information.

## Conclusion

The pandemic's imposition of social distancing and lockdowns brought about significant changes in societal norms and human interactions. The prolonged lack of intimate, face-to-face contact pushed many toward a desire for tangible connection that some predict could result in unprecedented displays of affection once it's safe to resume typical social interactions. This period highlighted vulnerabilities in societal structures, emphasizing the need for both tangible preparedness and psychological resilience in the face of unprecedented challenges.

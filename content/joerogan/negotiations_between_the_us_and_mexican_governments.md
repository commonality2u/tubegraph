The negotiations between the US and Mexican governments have been a complex interplay of diplomatic and political maneuvering, especially in the context of [[political_influence_and_corruption_in_mexican_government | corruption]], [[cartel_impact_on_economy_and_illegal_drug_trade | cartel influence]], and the designation of cartels as terrorist organizations.

## Cartels and Terrorist Designation

The potential designation of Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations was a significant diplomatic tension point. When President Trump threatened to label the cartels as terrorist groups, it suggested a pathway for direct military intervention by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30">[03:30]</a>. This proposal was controversial and prompted discussions between Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) and US officials. Such a designation would not only permit direct military actions like airstrikes without Mexican permission but also target cartel financial networks aggressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25">[09:25]</a>.

## Diplomatic Maneuvers

The talks resulted in some concessions from the Mexican government. A significant diplomatic outcome was the withdrawal of asylum to Evo Morales, deposed president of Bolivia, who had been granted asylum by AMLO after his ousting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06">[04:06]</a>. Additionally, former Mexican officials associated with cartel activities have faced consequences, like the arrest of the former head of public security, Genaro García Luna, accused of taking payoffs from cartels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44">[04:44]</a>.

## Mexican National Guard and Border Security

Part of AMLO's strategy involved creating a National Guard to replace the military’s role in the drug war and refocus efforts on border security tasks. This shift was aimed at reducing the direct confrontation between the military and cartels, aligning with his campaign promise of "hugs not bullets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44">[05:44]</a>. However, a significant part of this force’s deployment has focused on controlling immigration, a priority for the US government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30">[06:30]</a>.

## Cartel Influence and Economic Interests

The negotiations also intersect with economic interests. One consideration is [[cartel_impact_on_economy_and_illegal_drug_trade | lithium deposits]] in regions like Sonora, vital for industries dependent on lithium, such as battery manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02">[13:02]</a>. Post the Mormon massacre, this region's strategic importance has grown, complicating US-Mexico relations further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43">[12:43]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

The complexity of US-Mexican negotiations is exacerbated by the interconnected issues of [[cartel_violence_and_roadblocks_in_mexico | cartel violence]], [[political_influence_and_corruption_in_mexican_government | political influence]], and security challenges. The socio-economic ties and border security demands form a tightrope that both countries must navigate carefully. 

As the landscape evolves with new administrations and ongoing cartel activities, the negotiations are expected to continue shaping policy affecting not only national security but also regional stability and economic cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:03">[42:03]</a>. The ongoing challenges illustrate the need for strategic collaboration and comprehensive solutions to the issues impacting both nations.

> [!info] Contextual Considerations
> 
> - **Influence of Cartels**: Unlike typical terrorist organizations, cartels are primarily driven by economics rather than political ideology, complicating traditional counter-terrorism approaches.
> - **Economic and Social Effects**: The interconnected economies and cross-border social dynamics between the US and Mexico add layers of complexity to these negotiations.

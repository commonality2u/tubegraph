Stephen Gilchrist Glover, famously known as [[SteveOs stunts and injuries | Steve-O]], is renowned for his outrageous stunts and comedy. However, his life off-camera has been just as eventful and, at times, perilous, involving frequent encounters with the legal system and time spent in jail.

## Steve-O's Arrests

Steve-O's legal issues began as early as his teenage years. His first encounter with the law happened when he was caught with marijuana while attending high school in England<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Over time, he has been arrested in various countries, including Canada, England, the United States, and Sweden<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Notably, his arrest in Sweden was for international drug smuggling, which involved swallowing a package of marijuana to transport it across international borders<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Notable Jail Sentences

- **Orlando 1996**: Steve-O was sentenced to 10 days for drunk driving, which he negotiated so he wouldn't have to return to face further legal proceedings<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
- **Los Angeles County**: He was jailed for charges including felony obscenity and principal to second-degree battery following a stunt-gone-wrong during one of his performances<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Steve-O’s Crane Stunt and SeaWorld Protest

Perhaps one of the most publicized incidents was his protest against SeaWorld, where he altered a highway sign to read "SeaWorld Sucks" and climbed a 150-foot crane in Los Angeles<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This protest was against animal captivity, aligning with his strong activism in this area, notably mentioned in [[SteveOs protest against SeaWorld]].

As a result, Steve-O faced legal charges and insisted on jail time to align with his protest theme of experiencing captivity<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Steve-O has also been caught up in violent incidents on stage, leading to legal issues.

Steve-O, famously known for his daring stunts on the MTV series *Jackass*, has lived a life full of extreme antics, substance abuse, and legal troubles. However, Steve-O has turned his life around and embarked on a journey towards [[mental_health_sobriety_and_personal_growth | sobriety and personal growth]].

## Substance Abuse and Legal Issues

Steve-O's substance abuse history is extensive. He was open about his struggles with drugs and alcohol, which led him to numerous arrests and reckless behavior. For instance, he mentioned being arrested multiple times - from possessing drugs to causing disturbances in various countries, including Canada and England. Some of these incidents were linked to his participation in drug smuggling and public indecency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

One particularly notable event was his infamous protest against SeaWorld, where he climbed a 150-foot crane in Los Angeles with an inflatable killer whale. This stunt resulted in him being sentenced to jail for 30 days, a consequence he specifically requested as a form of captivity to reflect the message of his protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. His dedication to this cause is detailed further in [[steveos_protest_against_seaworld | SteveO's protest against SeaWorld]].

## The Turning Point

The turning point for Steve-O came when his friends, including fellow *Jackass* star Johnny Knoxville, staged an intervention. Steve-O had been sending mass emails detailing his self-destruction, which concerned those around him. Knoxville and others intervened, leading to Steve-O's admittance into a psychiatric ward under a 72-hour hold, known as a 5150 assessment. This moment of intervention was critical in forcing Steve-O to confront the severity of his addiction issues and consider rehabilitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>.

## Path to Sobriety

Following his release from the psychiatric ward, Steve-O entered rehab, where he committed to a program that significantly extended beyond the initial requirements. Dr. Drew Pinsky was instrumental in advising Steve-O to stay longer in treatment to better his chances of a successful recovery. Steve-O took this advice to heart, staying in sober living environments for extended periods and fully engaging in the 12-step program to address his addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>.

While in recovery, Steve-O focused on facing the root causes of his addiction, including his history of reckless behavior and mental health challenges. He participated in therapy and group sessions, and he committed to changing his lifestyle profoundly.

## Continuing Commitment to Sobriety

Today, Steve-O has maintained sobriety for over seven years. His lifestyle changes include adopting a vegan diet and focusing on healthy living. He is also active in the recovery community, sponsoring others on their journeys to sobriety and sharing his story to inspire and motivate others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

Steve-O's journey is also marked by his willingness to share his progress publicly, often through comedy and storytelling. His stand-up comedy and specials, such as [[steveos_comedy_tour_and_special | SteveOs comedy tour and special]], reflect his past experiences and his efforts to grow beyond his former lifestyle.

## Conclusion

Steve-O's journey to sobriety is a testament to resilience and personal growth. It's an ongoing commitment to not only maintaining sobriety but also to using his platform to help others struggling with similar issues. His story is a powerful example of transformation and the ability to reclaim one's life from the grips of addiction.

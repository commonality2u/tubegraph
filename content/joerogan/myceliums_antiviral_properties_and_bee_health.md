Mycelium, the vegetative part of fungi, plays a crucial role in ecosystems as well as having potential benefits for [[the_seriousness_and_impact_of_infectious_diseases | combating viruses]]. Recent research suggests mycelium could play a pivotal role in addressing the colony collapse disorder affecting bee populations globally.

## Colony Collapse Disorder and its Impact

Colony collapse disorder (CCD) poses a significant threat to global food security as it decimates bee populations, which are crucial for pollination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. For example, in recent years, Oklahoma lost 85% of its bee hives, while Maryland lost 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. Bees are essential pollinators; one bee can pollinate up to a thousand flowers per day, making them invaluable to crops like almonds, which are heavily dependent on bee pollination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## The Mycelium Solution

Paul Stamets, a researcher with extensive experience in mycology, has discovered potential solutions using mycelium extracts to combat CCD. Inspired by various encounters and personal insights, Stamets hypothesized that mycelium could mitigate the viruses attacking bees, such as the deformed wing virus, by enhancing their immune systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

In a lucid dream—a state Stamets advocates for stimulating innovative thought—he amalgamated his knowledge of mycelium's properties with his observations of bee behavior and achieved a breakthrough insight into potential treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:23">[01:26:23]</a>.

## Research and Results

Stamets' research at Washington State University corroborated his theory: extracts from the *Amadou* mushroom (Fomes fomentarius), known for its antiviral properties, were shown to double the lifespan of bees and significantly reduce virus levels in their systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:11">[01:27:11]</a>. This has large implications for agricultural practices that rely on bees for pollination.

## Ecological Significance and Future Prospects

This discovery emphasizes the ecological importance of preserving fungal biodiversity. Mycelium acts as a critical component of the Earth's immune system, providing antiviral agents that are beneficial across various species, including bees, humans, and potentially for addressing [[transmission_and_incubation_of_respiratory_viruses | respiratory viruses]]. This underscores the necessity of protecting old-growth forests and diverse fungal species for their invaluable ecological functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

> Stamets' findings suggest we can use mycelium not just to aid in current agricultural dilemmas but also to forge new sustainable pathways by leveraging fungal intelligence. This aligns with strategies to counter biodiversity loss and improve food security globally.

In summary, mycelium's antiviral properties offer a promising avenue for combating colony collapse disorder, benefiting bee health and, by extension, global food security. This research highlights the untapped potential within fungi, marking a significant advance in ecological and [[historical_and_cultural_significance_of_fungi | cultural understandings of fungi]] today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>.

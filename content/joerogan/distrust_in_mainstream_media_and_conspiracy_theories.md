The relationship between mainstream media and the public has transformed significantly over the years, especially with the advent of social media and the rise of alternative media sources. A growing number of people express distrust in mainstream media, turning instead to [[conspiracy_theories]] and alternative narratives for information and understanding.

## Perceived Media Bias

Mainstream media is often criticized for having biases, whether political or commercial, which can influence public perception and foster distrust among audiences. The idea that significant parts of the story are being omitted or distorted leads some individuals to seek answers independently, often stumbling upon forums and groups that entertain [[conspiracy_theories_and_skepticism | conspiracy theories and skepticism]] about the official narratives.

> The influence of media bias on public perception cannot be underestimated. Individuals are increasingly aware of the potential for bias, leading them to question the validity of the information presented by major news outlets. This skepticism lays the groundwork for conspiracy theories to take hold, providing alternative explanations that fill the gaps left by perceived media omissions.

## Conspiracy Theories as Alternative Narratives

In the search for truth and alternative narratives, conspiracy theories thrive as they offer explanations for the unexplained or misunderstood events in the world. In some cases, these theories propose covert plans carried out by powerful groups, offering a narrative that exploits mistrust in authoritative sources such as government and traditional media. This skepticism is often fueled by ideologies that resonate deeply with individuals, regardless of their empirical validity.

Alternative theories are perceived as a counterbalance to a media landscape that some view as excessively controlled.

## Impact of Conspiracy Theories

While these theories can provide a sense of autonomy and understanding for individuals who feel marginalized or neglected by the mainstream, they also pose risks. The more harmful conspiracy theories can lead to public misinformation, contributing to societal discord and misinterpretations of critical issues, such as the response to pandemics or climate change.

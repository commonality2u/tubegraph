> "At first I was like I'm fine then I'm 42 then it's like let's try some ones then it's 1 to 5 and then it's 1/5 so no I stopped because I have so many glasses some of them are ones some of them are 2 fives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Focusing on Retaining What's Important

Despite the struggles with aging eyesight, Downey expresses a mindset of focusing on retaining the most critical aspects of life while letting go of others:

This suggests that while Downey is currently accepting the limitations of aging, he remains open to innovation that could restore vision in the future.

He appears to draw parallels between personal growth and the evolution of his career, implying a broader acceptance of life's challenges and changes.

The subject of comet impacts and extinction events captivates scientists and researchers due to its deep-rooted connections with global cataclysms and the genesis of civilization. The recent discussions by Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock shed light on the comet impact theory and its implications on Earth's history, particularly during the [[younger_dryas_cataclysm | Younger Dryas period]]. This article examines the evidence of comet impacts that led to cataclysmic events, potentially altering the course of life on Earth.

## The Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis

Between 12,800 and 11,600 years ago, Earth experienced a series of catastrophic events that had profound impacts on global climate and ecosystems. During this period, known as the Younger Dryas, North America became the epicenter of a global cataclysm attributed to the impact of several fragments of a giant comet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Scientific evidence supports that these comet impacts caused massive flooding, dramatic climate shifts, and widespread extinction.

## Evidence of Catastrophic Flooding

Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock embarked on a research trip across the Channel Scablands of Washington State, where they found irrefutable evidence of cataclysmic flooding. This involved documenting geological formations like The Kamas Prairie's gigantic ripples, which were 50 feet high and stretched hundreds of feet long. These flood formations serve as testimony to the power of the melting ice sheets and the deluge of water flowing across the land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Above the town of Wenatchee, they observed an 18,000-ton boulder, likely transported by Ice Age floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Impact on Animal Extinction

The comet fragments that triggered these cataclysmic floods also led to the extinction of numerous megafauna species. The black matte layer, rich in carbon soot from continent-wide wildfires, is a testament to these impacts. Below this layer, the bones of extinct animals, such as mammoths, are found, whereas above it, only extant mammal remains are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>. This extinction event drastically altered biodiversity, contributing to the disappearance of 75% of Mega mammals in North America alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

## The Global Memory of Comet Impact

Comet impacts have left engravings not only on the Earth's surface but also in cultural consciousness. Many cultures harbor myths linking comets with disaster, indicating an inherited memory of such impacts, possibly passed down by ancient survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. This collective memory tends to evoke fear of comets in diverse civilizations globally.

## Modern Implications and Lessons

The study of ancient comet impacts offers crucial lessons for our present and future. Despite their relatively rare occurrences, comet impacts pose a significant threat to Earth. Contemporary scientists acknowledge the need to monitor and potentially intercept objects from space that could threaten global civilizationâ€”tasks that require international cooperation and technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:58">[02:19:58]</a>.

> [!info] Call to Action
> 
> Hancock and Carlson advocate for a global effort akin to a "war on asteroids," redirecting resources often invested in military endeavors to safeguard the planet from cosmic hazards. This initiative highlights human capability and responsibility to protect Earth's future.

In conclusion, the study of comet impacts and their role in extinction events reveals critical aspects of our planet's history, reminding us of Earth's vulnerability to space phenomena. By improving our understanding and preparedness, we may prevent future cataclysms and preserve human civilization.

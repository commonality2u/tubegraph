Sleep is a complex state with various stages, each serving unique and essential functions for maintaining health and wellbeing. Two principal types of sleep are non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and REM sleep, often called "dream sleep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Non-REM Sleep Stages

Non-REM sleep is further divided into four stages, unimaginatively labeled as stages one through four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. These stages vary from light to deep sleep, with stages three and four representing the deep stages crucial for body replenishment, cardiovascular health, and metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

- **Stage 1**: Transition between wakefulness and sleep, light sleep where you can be easily awakened.
- **Stage 2**: Light sleep before entering deeper sleep, characterized by heart rate slowdown and a decrease in body temperature.
- **Stage 3 & 4**: Deep sleep stages essential for physical restoration and recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Interestingly, when sleeping in an unusual environment, such as a hotel room, half of your brain resists entering these deep stages of non-REM sleep, acting as a threat detection system by staying in lighter stages of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## REM Sleep

REM sleep, or dream sleep, is a state where vivid dreaming occurs. It's crucial for processing emotions and memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Unlike non-REM sleep, the body undergoes a form of temporary paralysis during REM to prevent you from acting out dreams, allowing safe processing of intense dream activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

### Impacts of REM Sleep Deprivation 

Substances like alcohol and marijuana can block REM sleep, leading to what is described as a REM sleep rebound effect. After coming off these substances, the brain, which has a built-up need for dream sleep, enters a state of intense dreaming to compensate for the lost REM sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. It's noted that studies have yet to fully explore the long-term effects of chronic REM sleep suppression due to marijuana use, although comparisons with alcohol suggest significant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Importance of Non-REM and REM Sleep Balance

All stages of sleep, from non-REM stages 1 through 4 to REM sleep, are critical for various bodily functions. Evolutionarily, if sleep was not absolutely necessary, it would not have been selected as a persistent behavior across species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. Both sleep types contribute to [[role_of_sleep_in_learning_and_memory | learning and memory]], emotional regulation, and overall [[effects_of_sleep_on_physical_and_mental_health | physical and mental health]].

Experts argue against the oversimplified view that certain substances or behaviors can bypass one type of sleep to the benefit of others; each stage complements the others in maintaining holistic health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>.

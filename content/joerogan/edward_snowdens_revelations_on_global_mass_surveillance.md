Edward Snowden, a former CIA and NSA contractor, rose to global prominence in 2013 when he disclosed massive amounts of classified information detailing the United States government's global [[privacy_and_mass_surveillance | mass surveillance]] programs. These revelations sparked a worldwide debate on [[nsa_and_illegal_mass_surveillance | privacy]], [[constitutional_violations_and_privacy_concerns | constitutional rights]], and government overreach. 

## The Background of Snowden's Whistleblowing

### Permanent Record

Snowden's book, *Permanent Record*, serves as both an autobiography and a detailed account of the changing landscape of technology and government [[privacy_concerns_with_technology_and_surveillance | post-9/11]]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. He emphasizes the dangers posed by unchecked [[government_secrecy_and_potential_coverups | government secrecy]] and the [[patriot_act_and_its_implications | post-9/11 legal framework]] that facilitated mass surveillance programs.

### The Unfolding of Global Surveillance

Before his revelations, Snowden worked within various intelligence agencies, witnessing firsthand how programs developed ostensibly for national security had grown into global [[technological_advancements_and_mass_data_collection | surveillance apparatuses]] that collected data indiscriminately on a mass scale<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## The Stellar Wind Program

### Initiation and Abuse of Surveillance

One of the central points in Snowden's revelations was the [[nsa_and_illegal_mass_surveillance | Stellar Wind]] program, a warrantless wiretapping operation that gathered phone records and internet communications of millions of Americans. Initiated by the Bush administration after 9/11, it continued through subsequent presidencies despite being deemed illegal by various government audits<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>.

### Impact and Legal Battles

The programs revealed under Stellar Wind led to numerous legal challenges and public outcry. Institutions like the NSA were found to have violated privacy laws thousands of times, prompting debates over [[privacy_concerns_with_technology_and_surveillance | privacy]] and oversight<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:44">[01:40:44]</a>.

## Reaction and Legacy

### Government's Attempt to Silence

The U.S. government launched legal actions against Snowden, accusing him of violations under the Espionage Act. The actions primarily focused on restricting his earnings from his publications and preventing the dissemination of his book<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Global Discourse on Surveillance

Snowden's disclosures have had a lasting impact on the global discourse surrounding privacy and surveillance. They have spurred reforms and legislative changes worldwide, including in the United States, where they exposed how such programs violated privacy enshrined under constitutional rights<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:04">[02:49:04]</a>.

> "Patriotism is not about loyalty to government. Itâ€™s about loyalty to the country and the people" - Edward Snowden<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:48">[01:29:48]</a>.

## Additional Notes

- Snowden currently resides in Russia, having been granted asylum after the U.S. canceled his passport, which stranded him there<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:09">[02:17:09]</a>.
- Despite facing significant personal risk, Snowden continues to advocate for privacy and free expression online, frequently criticizing regimes, including Russia, for their surveillance policies<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:15">[02:15:15]</a>.

Snowden's actions and insights continue to be vital in the ongoing discourse about privacy, security, and freedom in the digital age. The scope of his revelations underscores the necessity of public oversight and the preservation of fundamental human rights.

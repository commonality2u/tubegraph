Graham Hancock is an author renowned for his controversial theories about [[lost_civilizations_and_archaeology | lost civilizations]] and their potential impacts on human history. He has been a prominent figure challenging established historical paradigms for decades, proposing that there might have been advanced prehistoric civilizations that mainstream archaeology has failed to account for.

## Gobekli Tepe and Megalithic Architecture

One of the keystones of Hancock’s arguments is the discovery of Gobekli Tepe in Turkey, which dates back to 11,600 years ago. It challenges the mainstream view that megalithic architecture appeared only about 6,000 years ago, such as the site called Gigantia in Malta, believed to be the oldest at roughly 5,800 years old. Gobekli Tepe, which appeared in a region with no prior evidence of agriculture, potentially supports [[theories_of_ancient_advanced_civilizations | theories of ancient advanced civilizations]] and raises questions about uncharted history that archaeology might have missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15">[06:15]</a>.

## Global Cataclysms and Impact Hypotheses

Hancock strongly posits the hypothesis of a global cataclysmic event, roughly 12,800 years ago, which he believes wiped out an advanced civilization. He suggests this theory in his book "Fingerprints of the Gods" and asserts that since 2007, a group of scientists has supported the notion that the Earth was bombarded by fragments of a giant comet, causing worldwide disasters. This theory helps explain rises in sea levels and extinctions at the end of the ice age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11">[08:11]</a>. This aligns with his ideas in [[cataclysmic_events_and_ancient_history | cataclysmic events and ancient history]].

## The Americas and Prehistoric Peoples

In his work, Hancock has challenged the long-held belief in the "Clovis first" model in American archaeology, which proposed that the Clovis people were the first inhabitants of the Americas, arriving around 13,400 years ago. New findings suggest that humans might have been present much earlier, possibly 130,000 years ago, with notable evidence including mastodon bones that experts claim were modified by humans. Such findings compel a revision of the narrative regarding the peopling of the Americas and understanding the continent's role in the broader scope of human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00">[17:00]</a>.

## The Mysterious Amazon

Hancock's research extends to the Amazon, which covers a massive, largely unexplored region roughly the size of the Indian subcontinent. Traces of ancient cities, roads, and biochar known as "terra preta" suggest a sophisticated level of habitation and environmental manipulation. The vast extent of these features contradicts previous beliefs that the Amazon was sparsely inhabited, redefining it as a potentially rich center of prehistoric civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31">[34:31]</a>.

## Sky Connections and Astronomical Alignments

Hancock also explores the alignment and purpose of ancient structures in relation to the heavens. Sites like Serpent Mound in Ohio, with its summer solstice alignment, suggest these constructions reflected a deep understanding of astronomy, reinforcing [[ancient_civilizations_and_historical_mysteries | historical mysteries]] in ancient cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:18">[33:18]</a>.

## The Impact of Hancock’s Work

Despite facing criticism and skepticism from mainstream academia, Hancock’s works like "America Before" invite readers and researchers to reflect critically on how history is written. His ideas foster debate and have bolstered interest in the potential depth and diversity of [[graham_hancocks_theories_and_prehistoric_civilizations | Graham Hancock's theories and prehistoric civilizations]].

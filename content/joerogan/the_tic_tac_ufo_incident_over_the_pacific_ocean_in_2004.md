The Tic Tac UFO incident is one of the most compelling cases involving unidentified aerial phenomena observed by military personnel. It occurred on November 14, 2004, involving the U.S. Navy off the coast between San Diego and Ensenada, Mexico. The incident has garnered significant attention due to the credentials of the witnesses and the availability of corroborating evidence.

## Background

The event took place during routine training exercises of the USS Nimitz Carrier Strike Group. Commander David Fravor was the commanding officer of VFA-41, a Navy fighter squadron known as the Black Aces, stationed aboard the USS Nimitz at the time. Cmdr. Fravor, who had served 24 years in the military and was an experienced pilot, has provided detailed accounts of the incident that defy conventional understanding of aviation and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Narrative of the Incident

During the exercises, Cmdr. Fravor and his squadron were vectored from their mission to investigate mysterious radar contacts that had been detected by the USS Princeton, a cruiser equipped with the advanced SPY-1 radar system. These unexplained objects were observed descending from approximately 80,000 feet to 20,000 feet and then hovering before rapidly ascending again. This had been happening intermittently over two weeks before the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Cmdr. Fravor and his wingman were directed to these coordinates and, upon reaching the location, Fravor described witnessing a disturbance in the water below, suggesting something was just beneath the surface. Above this disturbance, he observed a "Tic Tac" shaped object, around 40 feet in length, maneuvering erratically but with purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

The object then started to mirror the maneuvers of Cmdr. Fravor's aircraft, before suddenly accelerating away at immense speed that Fravor described as unlike anything he had seen before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

## Video Evidence

Following Cmdr. Fravor's observation, another aircraft equipped with an advanced camera, known as an ATFLIR pod, was able to capture video of the object. This footage has become widely known as the "Tic Tac video". The video, which was later publicly released, shows the object moving at high speeds with no visible means of propulsion, and it actively jammed the radar systems of the pursuing aircraft, which is classified as an act of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

> The videos and reports of the incident were eventually made public largely due to efforts from various individuals, including Jeremy Corbell and investigative journalist George Knapp. Their work has been instrumental in bringing military UFO encounters to the mainstream audience, influencing public and governmental attitudes towards UFO research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

## Implications and Responses

The incident prompted discussions about UFOs at high levels of government. Cmdr. Fravor and other witnesses have since briefed government officials on their experiences, underscoring the potential need for more robust procedures for reporting and investigating such encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

This event, along with others such as the [[gimbal_video | Gimbal]] and [[go_fast_video | Go Fast]] videos, has influenced policies regarding military engagements with unexplained aerial phenomena, leading to more open acknowledgment of the existence of UFOs by military organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Tic Tac UFO incident continues to be a focal point in discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena due to its credible witnesses, available video data, and the subsequent changes it has sparked in governmental approaches to UFO investigation and disclosure.

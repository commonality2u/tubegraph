Commander David Fravor is a highly experienced military aviator with a distinguished career in the United States Navy. However, he is perhaps best known for his direct involvement in a highly publicized and much-debated UFO encounter.

## Military Background

Commander Fravor served for 24 years in the military, beginning as an enlisted Marine before attending the Naval Academy. He spent 18 years as a pilot for the Navy, operating various aircraft including the A-6, F/A-18 Hornet, and F/A-18 Super Hornet. Throughout his career, Fravor completed every qualification available for his aircraft, including NVG high/low training, and attended Top Gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. At the time of the UFO incident, he was the commanding officer of VFA-41, the Black Aces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. His career, marked by extensive flying experience, lent significant weight to his later encounter with an unidentified flying object (UFO).

## The UFO Encounter

### The Incident

On November 14, 2004, while conducting training exercises for the 2005 deployment, Fravor and his squadron were operating off the coast between San Diego and Ensenada, Mexico. During an air defense exercise, they were redirected by the USS Princeton to investigate unidentified objects that had been tracked for two weeks, descending from above 80,000 feet to 20,000 feet and hovering for hours before ascending again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This was unknown to Fravor and his team as they conducted their routine training exercises.

Upon receiving a real-world vector task from the Princeton's controller, Fravor and his wingman flew to intercept one of these objects. They observed a 40-foot-long, white, tic-tac-shaped object moving erratically above a disturbance in the water, which disappeared when approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Notably, the object reportedly had no wings, rotors, or visible means of propulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

Fravor attempted to close in on the object, at which point it ascended at a rapid pace and disappeared. It then reappeared 40 miles away in under a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

### Aftermath

The incident was followed by a recorded video captured by a later flight team, famously dubbed the "Tic Tac" video. This video became a pivotal piece of evidence in the discussion of UFOs. Following the encounter, Commander Fravor's colleagues and their ships' crews quickly became aware of the event, as stories spread rapidly throughout the ships engaged in the exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

Fravor later reflected on the implications of the encounter for both science and military defense, noting the mysterious object's seemingly advanced technology and unknown origin, stimulating broader interest and intrigue in UFO phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:29">[01:31:29]</a>.

## Broader Impact and Continuing Discussions

Commander Fravor's encounter was widely covered in media, most notably by the New York Times in 2017. It is a significant part of ongoing public discussions and government investigations into UFOs. Fravor's testimony, along with radar and video evidence, has prompted further interest and inquiry into the nature of such phenomena. This has encouraged the military to take more serious steps in tracking and understanding these occurrences [[recent_ufo_sightings_and_military_involvement]].

Fravor's credibility as a military officer and pilot has added substantial weight to discussions about UFOs and their implications for future military and exploratory endeavors [[ufo_investigations]]. His firsthand account continues to inspire both governmental and private sector interest in potential technological advancements that could stem from such studies [[government_investigations_and_secrecy_surrounding_ufos]].

Commander Fravor's narrative remains an influential component of the broader conversation on UFOs, challenging both the skeptical perspectives and promoting deeper research into aerial phenomena [[the_exploration_of_potential_ufo_and_alien_encounters]].

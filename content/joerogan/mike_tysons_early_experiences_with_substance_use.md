Mike Tyson, widely known for his illustrious career in [[mike_tysons_boxing_career_and_unique_approach | boxing]], also had a complex past involving early exposure to substance use. Tyson's encounters with substances began at a notably young age, a testament to his tumultuous childhood and environment.

## Introduction to Substances

Tyson's first experience with drugs came at the tender age of nine or ten. He started with smoking and drinking, substances often deemed less potent but impactful for a child. By the age of 11, Tyson had already experimented with acid, an unusually early introduction to psychedelics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This early initiation into substance use set the stage for a life entangled with various substances.

## The Role of Environment

Tyson's environment played a significant role in his early exposure to drugs. Growing up in challenging conditions with a mother who was an alcoholic contributed to his early encounters. Tyson disclosed that his mother would provide him with liquor and marijuana in hopes that it would help him sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:46">[04:21:46]</a>. Such experiences illustrate the normalized use of substances in his upbringing.

## Impact on Tyson's Life

This early substance use had both immediate and long-term effects on Tyson's life. The early introduction to drugs and alcohol coincided with the trials and tribulations of a chaotic youth. Despite the difficulties associated with his early experiences, Tyson's life took a transformative turn as he progressed in his boxing career under the mentorship of Cus D'Amato.

However, Tyson's relationship with substances was not limited to his youth. As an adult, he would continue to navigate this complex relationship, notably through his involvement in the cannabis industry later in life, as seen in [[mike_tysons_involvement_with_cannabis_and_its_effects]].

The topic of free speech and the practice of [[deplatforming_and_freedom_of_expression_on_social_media | deplatforming]] individuals on social media have become pivotal debates in recent years. These discussions center around the power and responsibility of social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube in regulating what can be said and who can have a voice on their platforms. 

## The Role of Social Media Platforms

Social media platforms wield significant influence over public discourse, raising the question: Do we want these companies deciding what can and cannot be said? The central issue is whether governance of speech should lie within private companies or with governmental bodies, as this dictates the nature of society we wish to live in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>.

## Origins of Deplatforming

The practice of deplatforming initially gained traction with the case of the Islamic State, whose members utilized platforms like YouTube and Twitter to broadcast violent acts. These platforms took steps to remove such content, which led to a precedent that could potentially apply to a broader range of content deemed undesirable or offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.

## The Slippery Slope of Censorship

There is a concern that once deplatforming becomes normalized for certain extreme cases, it could be expanded to target a wider array of speech, such as harassment, racism, or dissenting political opinions. When companies like Twitter and Facebook ban users for seemingly trivial reasons, like promoting a third-party political candidate or even [[free_speech_and_censorship_on_social_media_platforms | expressing unpopular opinions]], it sparks debates about the boundary between moderation and censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a>.

## The Effect of Algorithmic Amplification

Beyond outright bans, the algorithms that govern what content is surfaced can play a significant role in shaping public discourse. Platforms like YouTube suggesting one video over another can lead to a cognitive echo chamber, further polarizing users and limiting exposure to diverse opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>.

## Legal and Rights Concerns

The question arises of whether these platforms should be treated as public utilities, given their role in modern communication. This would involve considering the extension of First Amendment rights to digital platforms, providing users protections similar to those found in public discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>.

## Moving Forward with Solutions

While some suggest using stricter legislations or oversight bodies to regulate speech on these platforms, others advocate for fostering a culture that promotes [[free_speech_and_censorship_in_universities_and_online | civility and open dialogue]]. The fundamental idea is that no solution should undermine the principle of free speech, as it may result in unintended censorship against legitimate, albeit disagreeable, discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:31">[02:23:31]</a>.

Free speech and the implications of deplatforming on social media touch at the heart of democratic principles regarding communication and the dissemination of ideas. As society evolves alongside technology, the balancing act between healthy discourse and harmful rhetoric will remain a challenging, yet crucial, endeavor.

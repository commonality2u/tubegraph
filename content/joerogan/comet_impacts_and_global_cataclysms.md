Comet impacts have played a significant role in shaping Earth's geological and biological history. These cosmic events are not just remnants of fairy tales or mythological stories, but rather are scientifically significant events that have influenced and could continue to influence Earth's environment.

## Historical Evidence of Comet Impacts

Considerable evidence points to comet impacts as the cause of various cataclysmic events. Geologists and archaeologists have studied layers of earth known to contain impact proxies such as nanodiamonds and carbon spherules. These suggest a significant meteor or comet impact event occurred around 12,800 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47">[08:47]</a>. This catastrophic event is believed to coincide with rapid climate shifts, including global cooling known as the [[younger_dryas_cataclysm | Younger Dryas]].

### Greenland Crater

One particular site of interest is an enormous crater found beneath the ice in Greenland. Estimated to be 18 miles wide, it is speculated to have been formed by an iron impactor. Tentative dating suggests that this crater formed between 12,800 and 11,600 years ago during a period in history when massive cataclysms significantly impacted Earth's climate and possibly ancient civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02">[10:02]</a>.

## Cometary Influence on Human Civilization

The discovery of these events has vast implications for our understanding of early human civilization. Many cultures have passed down stories of great floods and destruction, narratives that might be remnants of the collective memory of such cosmic impacts. Sites like [[gobekli_tepe]] are evidence that advanced human societies may have existed much earlier than traditionally acknowledged, indicating that a global cataclysm might have destroyed an early human civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00">[13:00]</a>.

## Current Threats from the Toried Meteor Stream

The Toried meteor stream, remnants from ancient cometary fragments, poses a significant continuing threat. Our planet passes through this meteor stream twice annually, and within it reside numerous potentially hazardous objects. Astronomers have identified several large fragments and suggest that there could be over 200 asteroids within this stream, any of which could potentially cause catastrophic impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39">[08:39]</a>.

### The Need for Proactive Measures

Despite this understanding, which comes from modern technological advancements and space exploration efforts, global efforts to counter potential future disastrous impacts remain minimal. However, with the same technology developed for mining asteroids, humanity could possibly deflect or prevent a future catastrophic impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38">[08:38]</a>.

## Conclusion

Our current understanding of [[comet_impacts_and_extinction_events | comet impacts]] provides a fascinating insight into Earth's historical cataclysms and offers a warning for the future. It reminds us of the delicate nature of our existence and the monumental forces beyond our planet that have the potential to alter its fate. Preparing for and addressing these cosmic threats should be a global priority, harnessing the collective knowledge and technology we possess today, as it could be essential for securing humanity's future on this planet.

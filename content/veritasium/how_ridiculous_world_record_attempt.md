Friends from the YouTube channel "How Ridiculous" visited the Gordon Dam in Tasmania to attempt to set a world record for the highest basket ever scored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. The dam stands at 126.5 meters (415 feet) high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

During their visit, they conducted an experiment, dropping a basketball over the edge of the dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. When dropped without spin, the basketball landed almost directly below the drop point, only slightly influenced by the breeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### The Unexpected Flight

A subsequent drop, performed by Bret, involved adding a bit of backspin to the basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The result was unexpected, as the ball "took off" horizontally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### The Magnus Effect

The dramatic horizontal movement of the spinning basketball is attributed to the **Magnus effect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This phenomenon impacts all rotating balls or cylinders as they move through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

#### How it Works
As a ball picks up speed while spinning:
*   Air on the front side of the ball moves in the same direction as the ball's spin, getting dragged along and deflected backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   Air on the opposite side moves against the ball's spin, causing the airflow to separate from the ball instead of being deflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   This creates a net result where the ball pushes air in one direction, causing the air to apply an equal and opposite force on the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

#### History
The Magnus effect was described by Heinrich Gustav Magnus in 1852, after whom it is named <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. However, Isaac Newton had observed and described a similar effect nearly two centuries earlier, regarding the flight of tennis balls at Cambridge College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

#### Applications
The Magnus effect is significant in various sports, including tennis, soccer, and golf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Beyond sports, it has been explored for non-sport applications:
*   **Flettner rotors**: These are spinning cylinders that replace sails on some ships, using the Magnus effect to deflect crosswinds and propel the vessel forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **Experimental aircraft**: Planes have been designed with spinning cylinders instead of wings to generate lift using the Magnus effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. While these cylinders can generate more lift than traditional wings, they also create significantly more drag, rendering them impractical; one such experimental plane only flew once before crashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

#### Modern Comeback
The Magnus effect is seeing a resurgence in modern applications:
*   An experimental rotor wing aircraft generates all its lift from spinning cylinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   The E-Ship 1 utilizes four Flettner rotors to enhance its efficiency and reduce diesel consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

In the future, the Magnus effect may extend its utility beyond enabling basketballs to fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

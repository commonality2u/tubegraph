Recently, friends from the YouTube channel "How Ridiculous" visited the Gordon Dam in Tasmania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The dam stands 126.5 meters (415 feet) high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While there, they conducted a [[gordon_dam_basketball_experiment | Gordon Dam basketball experiment]] involving dropping basketballs from the dam's edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The Basketball Drop Experiment

When a basketball was simply dropped over the edge, it was slightly affected by the breeze but landed almost directly below its drop point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. However, when another basketball was dropped with a bit of backspin, it dramatically veered away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Bret, who dropped the spinning ball, noted he "literally just dropped it, with a bit of spin," and it "just took off," surprising them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

This phenomenon occurred due to the Magnus effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### The Magnus Effect
The Magnus effect influences all rotating balls or cylinders moving through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. As a ball gains speed, air on the side spinning in the same direction as the ball's motion is dragged along and deflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. On the opposite side, where the air moves against the ball's spin, the airflow separates from the ball instead of deflecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The result is that the ball exerts a force on the air in one direction, causing the air to apply an equal and opposite force on the ball, known as the Magnus effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The effect is named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus, who described it in 1852 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, though Isaac Newton had described the flight of tennis balls affected by spin nearly two centuries earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The Magnus effect is crucial in sports like tennis, soccer, and golf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. It also has non-sport applications, such as in Flettner rotors on ships to propel them using crosswinds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, and experimental aircraft that generate lift from spinning cylinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## World Record Attempt

The primary reason for the "How Ridiculous" friends' visit to the Gordon Dam was to attempt setting the world record for the highest basket ever scored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Viewers are encouraged to visit their channel to watch the video of their attempt and other trick shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

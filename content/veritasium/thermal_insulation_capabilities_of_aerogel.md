[[properties_of_aerogel | Aerogel]], known as the world's lightest solid, is an excellent thermal insulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Its insulating properties were first recognized by its [[history_and_invention_of_aerogel | inventor Samuel Kistler]] in 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Demonstrating Thermal Insulation

To illustrate its extraordinary thermal insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] can be combined with a non-flammable binder to form a paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This paste, composed of silica aerogel particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, can be applied to skin, allowing a person to endure a blowtorch flame directly on it without feeling significant heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

During a demonstration, a blowtorch flame, typically ranging from 1500°C to 2000°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, was applied to a thin layer of aerogel paste on a finger. Even when the aerogel itself was glowing orange hot, reaching temperatures of 907°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, the finger behind the layer felt only warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This clearly demonstrates the material's insulating capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Thermal Conductivity

The thermal conductivity of traditional silica aerogel is approximately 15 milliwatts per meter Kelvin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This makes it two to three times more insulating than styrofoam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Other aerogel materials, such as those made from polymers (like a polyimide aerogel from NASA, internally called "Martian tape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>), can have thermal conductivities of 20 to 26 milliwatts per meter Kelvin, making them 1.5 to 2 times more insulating than styrofoam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

## Improving Usability: Composites

While aerogel is an excellent insulator, it is not the easiest material to work with due to its brittleness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It breaks easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. To make its extraordinary thermal insulation more usable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, aerogel is incorporated into [[aerogel_composites_and_materials_innovation | composite materials]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

One such composite is an aerogel blanket, which is made by infusing fiberglass with aerogel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This [[aerogel_composites_and_materials_innovation | fiberglass-aerogel composite]] overcomes the traditional fragility of aerogels, allowing the material to be flexed, cut, sewn, and wrapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The dust shed from this material is amorphous silica, which is considered safe and is readily expelled by the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

These blankets are used to insulate subsea oil pipelines and refineries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. A 1-centimeter thick aerogel blanket provides the same insulation value as 3 centimeters (over an inch) of mineral wool or fiberglass by itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Future [[development_and_future_applications_of_aerogel | applications and uses of aerogel]] blankets could include astronaut suits or apparel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

[[aerogel_as_a_thermal_insulator | Aerogel]] is known as the world's lightest solid and is an excellent [[aerogel_as_a_thermal_insulator | thermal insulator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Demonstrating Extreme Insulation

A direct demonstration of [[aerogel_as_a_thermal_insulator | aerogel]]'s insulating properties involves applying a blowtorch flame to a thin layer of material covering skin. A combination of [[properties_of_aerogel | silica aerogel]] particles and a non-flammable binder can be squeezed around a finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The blowtorch flame, which can reach temperatures between 1500째C and 2000째C, was applied directly to this layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Remarkably, despite the outer surface of the [[aerogel_as_a_thermal_insulator | aerogel]] reaching temperatures of 881째C to 907째C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, the finger underneath felt only a "little warmth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This clearly demonstrates the material's extraordinary insulating capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Insulating Mechanism

[[properties_of_aerogel | Aerogels]] are nano-structured materials with nano-sized pores, typically around 20 nanometers in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. They are composed of over 50% air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, which contributes to their lightweight nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a> and exceptional insulating properties.

## Comparative Performance

Traditional [[properties_of_aerogel | silica aerogel]] typically has a thermal conductivity of about 15 milliwatts per meter Kelvin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, meaning it insulates two to three times better than styrofoam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Other polymer-based [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogels]], like a polyimide [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] developed by NASA (informally called "Martian tape"), offer slightly less insulation (around 20 to 26 milliwatts per meter Kelvin), but are still 1.5 to 2 times more insulating than styrofoam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

When incorporated into composite materials like blankets, a one-centimeter-thick [[aerogel_as_a_thermal_insulator | aerogel]] blanket provides the same insulation value as three centimeters of mineral wool or fiberglass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This makes it a tremendously better insulator for certain [[practical_applications_of_aerogel | applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Improving Usability for Insulation

While [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] is naturally brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, it can be made more usable for [[aerogel_as_a_thermal_insulator | thermal insulation]] [[applications_of_aerogel_in_waterproofing_and_insulation | applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

*   **Binders**: [[properties_of_aerogel | Silica aerogel]] particles can be combined with a non-flammable binder to form a sticky paste, enabling direct application for insulation demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Composites**: [[properties_of_aerogel | Aerogel]] can be incorporated into composite materials, such as blankets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. An example is a fiberglass [[aerogel_as_a_thermal_insulator | aerogel]] composite, where the fiberglass infusion allows the material to be flexed, cut, sewn, and wrapped, overcoming the traditional fragility of [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## [[applications_of_aerogel_in_waterproofing_and_insulation | Applications in Insulation]]

The [[aerogel_as_a_thermal_insulator | thermal insulation]] properties of [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] have various [[practical_applications_of_aerogel | uses]]:

*   **Industrial Insulation**: [[Aerogel]] blankets are used to insulate subsea oil pipelines and refineries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Future Apparel and Space Technology**: New types of [[aerogel_as_a_thermal_insulator | aerogel]] blankets could potentially be found in astronaut suits or everyday apparel in the [[future_uses_of_aerogel_in_clothing_and_space_technology | future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Vacuum Regulation**: [[Aerogel]] with zeolite particles can absorb moisture even at very low pressures, helping to maintain a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This capability was crucial for the NASA InSight mission's seismometer, which required an exceptional vacuum to prevent motion damping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This "vacuum pump" does not require power and is very light, enabling the mission's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The [[Event Horizon Telescope and its results | Event Horizon Telescope]] (EHT) collaboration released the first-ever image of a [[black_holes and event horizons | black hole]] on April 10, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This image was of the supermassive [[black_holes and event horizons | black hole]] located at the center of the galaxy M87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While M87 was successfully imaged, the EHT also observed Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive [[black_holes and event horizons | black hole]] at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy, though an image of Sgr A* has not yet been released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## M87 Black Hole

The M87 [[black_holes and event horizons | black hole]] is a supermassive [[black_holes and event horizons | black hole]] with a mass 6.5 billion times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Its shadow is nearly the size of our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. It is located 53.5 million light-years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, making its apparent size from our perspective only about 40 micro arcseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

Key characteristics of the M87 [[black_holes and event horizons | black hole]] include:
*   **Activity**: It is very active, constantly feeding on matter from its glowing hot [[m87_black_hole_characteristics_and_accretion_disk | accretion disk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Plasma Orbit**: Plasma orbits clockwise around the [[black_holes and event horizons | black hole]], completing one orbit in approximately 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This plasma appears brighter when moving towards us and dimmer when moving away due to [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_black_holes | relativistic beaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Jets**: It possesses narrow, collimated jets above and below it, thought to be created by strong magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These jets extend at least 5,000 light-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, with one pointing almost directly at Earth, made visible by [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_black_holes | relativistic beaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Observation Wavelength**: The image was created using electromagnetic waves with a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters (radio waves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This wavelength was chosen because it can reveal features close to the [[black_holes and event horizons | event horizon]] and can penetrate the [[m87_black_hole_characteristics_and_accretion_disk | accretion disk]] and interstellar dust to reach telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Space-time Warping**: The warping of space-time around the M87 [[black_holes and event horizons | black hole]] allows observers to see light even from parts of the [[m87_black_hole_characteristics_and_accretion_disk | accretion disk]] located behind the [[black_holes and event horizons | black hole]]; this light is lensed above and below the shadow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Image Resolution**: The image appears fuzzy because, despite its immense size, its angular size from Earth is extremely small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. To achieve this resolution, the [[Event Horizon Telescope and its results | Event Horizon Telescope]] collaboration used eight telescopes spread across the globe, simulating an Earth-sized telescope through the Earth's rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Sagittarius A* Black Hole

Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is the supermassive [[black_holes and event horizons | black hole]] at the center of our Milky Way galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Mass**: It has a mass only four million times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Distance**: It is much closer than M87, located around 26,000 light-years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Activity**: Sgr A* is less active than M87, only periodically consuming matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Plasma Orbit**: The matter orbiting Sgr A* would exhibit much more variation over time, with orbits taking between four to thirty minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This rapid variation is a likely reason why an image of Sgr A* has not yet been released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

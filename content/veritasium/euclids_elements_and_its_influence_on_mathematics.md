From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Euclid's "Elements" is one of the oldest and most published math books, second only to the Bible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. For over 2,000 years, it served as the primary mathematics textbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Its influence was profound, particularly because a single, seemingly mistaken sentence within it ultimately unlocked deeper understandings of our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Euclid's Mathematical Framework

Around 300 BC, the Greek mathematician Euclid undertook a massive project to summarize all known [[history_and_foundations_of_set_theory_and_mathematics | mathematics]] of his time, creating a comprehensive text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Before Euclid, mathematical proofs often suffered from infinite recursion, where the fundamental reasons for truths were unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

To address this, Euclid pioneered a solution adopted by the Greeks: accepting a few simple, basic statements as true, known as postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. From these postulates, theorems could be logically proven one at a time, building up a rigorous mathematical system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This method established the gold standard for rigorous mathematical proof that modern [[history_and_foundations_of_set_theory_and_mathematics | mathematics]] relies on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

"The Elements" consists of 13 books, in which Euclid proved 465 theorems covering most of the [[history_and_foundations_of_set_theory_and_mathematics | mathematics]] known then, including geometry and number theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. All these theorems were based on definitions, common notions, and five postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Some of Euclid's definitions include:
*   "A point is that which has no part." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
*   "A line is a breadthless length." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   "The ends of lines are points." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>
*   "A straight line is a line that lies evenly within the points on itself." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>

He presented 23 definitions before introducing his five postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### The Five Postulates

The first four postulates are relatively simple and intuitive:
1.  Between any two points, a straight line can be drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
2.  A straight line can be extended indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  Given a center and a radius, a circle can be drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
4.  All right angles are equal to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

The fifth postulate, however, stands out for its complexity:
> "If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side, on which are the angles less than the two right angles." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>

This postulate's length and lack of obviousness made mathematicians suspicious, leading them to believe it might be a mistake that could be proven from the first four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## The Quest to Prove the Fifth Postulate

For over 2,000 years, mathematicians attempted to prove Euclid's fifth postulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Greek philosopher Proclus believed it should be a theorem derived from the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Many, including Ptolemy and Proclus, claimed success, but their attempts merely restated the postulate in different words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

One common restatement is: "If you have a line, and a point that is not on that line, then there is a single unique line which will be parallel to the first line." For this reason, it is often called the [[the_parallel_postulate_and_noneuclidean_geometry | Parallel Postulate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

When direct proof failed, mathematicians like al-Haytham and Omar Khayyam tried proof by contradiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This involved keeping the first four postulates true but assuming the fifth was false. If this led to a contradiction, it would prove the fifth postulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Two alternatives for a false fifth postulate were explored:
1.  **No parallel lines**: This assumption implied that lines had to be finite in length, which contradicted Euclid's second postulate (lines can be extended indefinitely) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
2.  **More than one parallel line**: Mathematicians could not find a contradiction when assuming more than one parallel line could be drawn through a point not on the first line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Since all attempts to prove the postulate failed, proof by contradiction also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## The Birth of Non-Euclidean Geometry

Around 1820, 17-year-old JÃ¡nos Bolyai became obsessed with the mystery of the [[the_parallel_postulate_and_noneuclidean_geometry | Parallel Postulate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Despite his father's warning to abandon the "bottomless night" of parallels, Bolyai persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. After years of work, he realized that the fifth postulate might be completely independent of the other four, meaning it could not be proven from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

Bolyai imagined a world where more than one parallel line could pass through a point not on a given line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This was possible on a curved surface, where "straight lines" are the shortest paths between two points (called geodesics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This concept led to what is now known as [[the_parallel_postulate_and_noneuclidean_geometry | hyperbolic geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

A model for [[the_parallel_postulate_and_noneuclidean_geometry | hyperbolic geometry]] is often visualized as a "crumpling" surface where more and more "fabric" is created outwards, causing parallel lines to diverge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The Poincare Disk Model demonstrates this by mapping the infinite hyperbolic plane into a finite disk, where triangles appear smaller towards the edge but are actually the same size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. In this model, straight lines are arcs of circles that intersect the disk at 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

Bolyai, though without a physical model, found that this new geometry was mathematically consistent, just like Euclid's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. In 1823, he proclaimed, "Out of nothing, I have created a strange new universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

Bolyai published his findings in 1832 as an appendix to his father's textbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. His father sent it to Carl Friedrich Gauss, who responded that the work coincided almost exactly with his own meditations over the past 30 to 35 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Indeed, Gauss had independently discovered this "curious geometry" in 1824, noting its paradoxical theorems, such as triangle angles becoming infinitesimally small while their area remained finite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. However, Gauss feared ridicule and did not publish his findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Another mathematician, Nikolai Lobachevsky, also independently discovered [[the_parallel_postulate_and_noneuclidean_geometry | non-Euclidean geometry]] several years before Bolyai's publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Gauss recognized Bolyai's genius, despite his cryptic reply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

### Spherical Geometry as Non-Euclidean

Prior to 1854, spherical geometry was not considered [[the_parallel_postulate_and_noneuclidean_geometry | non-Euclidean geometry]] because lines on a sphere (great circles) cannot be extended indefinitely, violating Euclid's second postulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. However, in 1854, Riemann redefined the second postulate from "infinite extension" to "unbounded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. This change allowed spherical geometry, where there are no parallel lines, to be considered a valid [[the_parallel_postulate_and_noneuclidean_geometry | non-Euclidean geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. On a sphere, all "straight lines" (great circles) eventually intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

## Euclid's "Other" Mistake: Definitions

While Euclid was right to include the fifth postulate, a different "mistake" lay in his attempt to define fundamental concepts like "point" and "line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Modern [[history_and_foundations_of_set_theory_and_mathematics | mathematics]] holds that instead of definitions, one should have undefined terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. What's crucial are the relationships between objects, as defined by postulates, rather than explicit definitions of the objects themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. This flexibility allows for different "geometric worlds" where "line" could mean a great circle on a sphere, or arcs of circles in a disk model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

### Geometry as a Game

Geometry can be thought of as a game where the first four postulates are the minimum rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. The choice for the fifth postulate then determines the "world" or type of geometry:
*   **No parallel lines**: Spherical geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>
*   **One parallel line**: Flat (Euclidean) geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>
*   **More than one parallel line**: [[the_parallel_postulate_and_noneuclidean_geometry | Hyperbolic geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>

Riemann further extended this by proposing a geometry where curvature could vary from place to place, not limited to two dimensions, but extendable to three or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. In 1868, Eugenio Beltrami proved that [[the_parallel_postulate_and_noneuclidean_geometry | hyperbolic]] and spherical geometries were as consistent as Euclid's flat geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Influence on Modern Physics: General Relativity

The development of [[the_parallel_postulate_and_noneuclidean_geometry | non-Euclidean geometries]] proved crucial for understanding the universe. In 1905, Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, based on constant laws of physics and the speed of light, revealed that space and time are relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. This posed a problem for Newtonian gravity, which relied on well-defined distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

In 1907, Einstein's "happiest thought" was realizing the equivalence between free fall in a uniform gravitational field and being in deep space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This implied that gravity is not a force, but rather a manifestation of objects following the shortest paths (geodesics) through curved spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Massive objects curve spacetime, and other objects move through this curved geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

This understanding is core to the General Theory of Relativity, published over a hundred years ago, which has been remarkably successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Observational evidence supporting this includes:
*   **Gravitational lensing**: In 2014, astronomers observed a supernova in four different places due to a massive galaxy curving spacetime, causing light to take multiple paths to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. A replay of the supernova was predicted and observed in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.
*   **Gravitational waves**: Ripples in spacetime itself, formed by cosmic events like black hole mergers, can now be measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

These phenomena confirm that the behavior of straight lines in curved geometries, concepts developed by Bolyai and Riemann, are fundamental to understanding our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

## The Shape of the Universe

The shape of the entire universe can be determined by measuring the angles of a triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>:
*   **Flat geometry**: Angles sum to 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **Spherical geometry**: Angles sum to more than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **Hyperbolic geometry**: Angles sum to less than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

Gauss attempted to measure the angles of a large triangle formed by three mountains, finding them to sum to 180 degrees within observational error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. However, this triangle was far too small relative to the universe's size to detect cosmic curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

To overcome this scale issue, astronomers measure cosmic triangles using the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the first light from the universe when it was 380,000 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. By observing the size of temperature variations in the CMB, which originated from quantum fluctuations in the early universe, scientists can determine the overall curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

Data from the Planck mission shows that the measured angles align almost exactly with what would be expected if the universe were flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. The current best estimate for the universe's curvature is 0.0007 Â± 0.0019, which is essentially zero within the margin of error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. This suggests the universe is flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>, a remarkably serendipitous finding given that a slight change in the average mass-energy density would result in a curved universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

Ultimately, the seemingly paradoxical and absurd geometries born from 2,000 years of thought on Euclid's single sentence became foundational to our best physical theories of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

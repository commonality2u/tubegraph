Nitinol is a metal often described as being "as close to magic as it is possible to find in nature" due to its extraordinary properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It possesses the ability to adjust its atomic arrangement to return to a predefined shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, convert between mechanical and thermal energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, and stretch up to 30 times more than ordinary metals while still springing back to its original size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. These unique characteristics make it a type of shape memory alloy (SMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## Discovery of Nitinol

Nitinol was discovered in 1961 at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. During experiments with nickel and titanium alloys, a sample that had been repeatedly worked, heated, and cooled was shown to an associate technical director who was a pipe smoker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. When he applied heat from his lighter to the sample, it unexpectedly changed shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This surprising observation led to further investigation, and the material was named Nitinol, combining "Nickel," "Titanium," and the "Naval Ordnance Laboratory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Properties of Nitinol

### Shape Memory Effect
Nitinol's ability to change shape is due to a solid-state phase change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Austenite Phase**: In heated Nitinol, atoms are arranged in a cubic lattice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This is the parent or "memory" shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Twinned Martensite Phase**: Upon cooling, the atoms transition into a messier, lower-symmetry arrangement known as twinned martensite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. In this phase, the material can be extensively deformed by applying stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Detwinned Martensite Phase**: When stress is applied to twinned martensite, the crystal structure changes to detwinned martensite, allowing for significant deformation without breaking atomic bonds or creating edge dislocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Shape Recovery**: When the material is heated back up, the atoms return to their original locations in the austenite phase, causing the material to return to its original predefined shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Superelasticity (Pseudoelasticity)
Nitinol also exhibits superelasticity, allowing it to stretch up to 8% of its length and still spring back to its original size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. This property occurs when the Nitinol is in the austenite phase and its transition temperature is lower than room temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Applying stress forces a crystal structure change from austenite to detwinned martensite, and when the stress is removed, the atoms spring back to the austenite phase, restoring the original shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. This stress-induced phase change in the solid state can be heard as a "pinging" sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

### Elastocalorics
The phase transformation in Nitinol involves thermal energy. When going from the higher symmetry austenite phase to the lower symmetry martensite phase (e.g., when stress is applied in superelasticity), the process is exothermic, releasing heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Conversely, when the stress is removed and the material returns to austenite, the phase change is endothermic, absorbing heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. This property is being investigated in the field of elastocalorics for applications like heat pumping or refrigeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

### Medical Devices
Nitinol is used in medical devices such as stents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. These stents are cooled to their martensite phase, allowing them to be crushed or elongated for insertion into a catheter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Once deployed in the body, the stent heats up and "bounces right back" to its original, larger diameter, opening arteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Actuators
Shape memory alloys can generate significant forces when heated, making them suitable for use as actuators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. A Nitinol wire can generate over 20 pounds of force, even lifting heavy objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This force generation has even been used to fracture a rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

### Aviation
Nitinol is being investigated for use in aviation. For example, it can be used for morphing aircraft wings or adaptive vortex generators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. These small fins on airplane wings help trip airflow into turbulence for takeoff and landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. At cruise altitude, where temperatures drop significantly (e.g., to -50°C), Nitinol can be tuned to autonomously stow flat, reducing drag, then deploy again as the plane descends for landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The transition temperature between austenite and martensite can be tuned between -150°C and -350°C by changing element ratios and heat treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. This principle has also been extended to operate main aircraft flaps using controlled heating elements, potentially replacing hydraulic actuators on aircraft like a 737 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

### Wheels

#### Bicycle Tires
Nitinol's superelasticity allows for the creation of durable, airless bicycle tires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. These tires do not require air pressure; their structure and shock absorption are provided by a metal slinky made of Nitinol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This design makes them immune to punctures, as demonstrated by driving over a bed of nails and even a bullet shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The tire maintains performance despite significant damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

#### [[the_development_and_advantages_of_nitinol_wheels | NASA's Rover Wheels]]
The development of Nitinol-based wheels originated from NASA's research into creating durable wheels for space missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Challenges of Space Wheels**:
    *   **Atmospheric Pressure**: Low or no atmospheric pressure on other planets means rubber pneumatic tires can explode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   **Extreme Temperatures**: Temperatures on the moon can range from 250°F above zero in direct sun to 250°F below zero in shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Rubber becomes brittle and shatters at such lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
    *   **Weight**: Launching mass into space is expensive, requiring lightweight wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   **Terrain Damage**: Aggressive terrain causes significant damage to existing metal wheels, as seen with the Curiosity rover's aluminum wheels, which developed large holes and cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Previous Solutions and Limitations**:
    *   **Hard Metal Wheels**: Most previous planetary exploration wheels were made of hard metal, such as the aluminum wheels of the Curiosity rover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. While strong, their thin skin (0.7 mm) was prone to damage from high peak loads on rough terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
    *   **Steel Mesh Wheels (Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle)**: These wheels used a woven steel wire structure (pantograph) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. They included an internal "bump stop" to limit deformation and prevent plastic deformation of the steel mesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. While effective for short missions, their performance degraded over longer periods due to accumulating permanent deformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Ordinary metals can only withstand 0.3-0.8% strain elastically before plastic deformation occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Nitinol Wheel Design**: NASA engineers weave Nitinol springs into a mesh to create these wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. This material's ability to deform up to 8% without permanent damage makes it ideal for long space missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. The superelastic behavior of Nitinol also provides dampening, acting like a shock absorber and potentially making the tire a complete suspension system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. By tying a "bump stop" element to the mesh, load is transferred 360 degrees around the tire, significantly increasing load-carrying capacity without adding mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. These wheels are extensively tested on terrain endurance rigs simulating lunar and Martian surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

#### Terrestrial Applications (Aircraft and Jeeps)
The technology developed for space wheels is also being applied to terrestrial vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. Airless Nitinol tires could replace pneumatic tires on aircraft, which require extremely high pressures (300-400 psi) and are prone to explosion and require significant maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. For cars and trucks, Nitinol tires would eliminate flat tires and improve fuel economy by always maintaining optimal inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

## Engineering Principles: Stress and Strain
*   **Stress**: A force applied to a material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. It tugs on atoms, changing their spacing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Strain**: The per-unit change in length or deformation of a material due to stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Elastic Deformation**: When a material deforms under stress but returns to its original size upon stress removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Atoms flex without moving permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Yield Strength**: The point at which applied stress exceeds the material's elastic limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Plastic Deformation**: Occurs when stress exceeds the yield strength, causing atoms to rearrange themselves and the deformation to be irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This can lead to defects called edge dislocations moving through the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. If enough stress is applied, the material can fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. For most ordinary metals, elastic strain is limited to around 0.3% to 0.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Nitinol's Advantage**: Unlike ordinary metals, Nitinol can endure much more strain (up to 8%) without deforming permanently, making it highly durable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

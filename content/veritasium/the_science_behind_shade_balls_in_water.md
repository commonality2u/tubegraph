[[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | Shade balls]] are plastic spheres used to cover reservoirs, primarily to protect water quality by blocking sunlight, which prevents the formation of harmful algae and reduces evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The question of whether one could swim in them, despite their purpose in drinking water reservoirs, led to a large-scale experiment involving 10,000 [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | shade balls]] in a private pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Properties of Shade Balls

[[purpose_and_function_of_shade_balls | Shade balls]] are inherently more dangerous for swimming than other plastic balls because they are half-full of water, making them heavy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. A bag containing 1,200 [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] weighs 300 kilograms (660 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Due to their weight and the manufacturers' safety concerns, they typically refuse to sell [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] to residential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Each ball, when fully submerged, can support approximately 300 grams of weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This means that to support an average adult's body entirely above the water, more than 260 [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] would need to be trapped underneath them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## The Swimming Experiment: Single Layer

Approximately 6,000 [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] were initially used to create a single layer across a swimming pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The balls naturally arranged themselves into crystal structures, forming a single, close-packed layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Observations
*   **Light Penetration**: Despite their purpose to block sunlight, a surprising amount of light still penetrates a single layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This is because even when packed as tightly as possible, spheres only cover about 91% of the water surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Light passing through the cracks and reflecting off the balls creates interesting patterns on the pool's bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Noise**: [[swimming_in_shade_balls | Swimming in shade balls]] generates significant noise close to the head, making it difficult to hear anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Physical Challenge**: While it was possible to swim in a single layer, it was significantly more challenging than swimming in open water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Swimmers reported being "knocked around like in a rock tumbler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Different strokes, such as breaststroke and front crawl, resulted in getting hit in the face by balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Butterfly stroke proved even more challenging due to the need to push the balls forward, down, and up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This experience was described as "next level" in terms of workout intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Drag Force**: [[physical_challenges_of_moving_through_shade_balls | Swimming in shade balls]] highlighted the concept of drag, the force that opposes motion through a fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] are imagined as particles of their own fluid, the drag force is proportional to the square of velocity (VÂ²) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This is because the faster a swimmer moves, the more balls they encounter per second, and the faster the balls move relative to the swimmer, increasing the impact force as they are pushed out of the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## The Swimming Experiment: Multi-Layer

The majority of the LA reservoir is covered with multiple layers of [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Observations
*   **Floating**: While a single layer did not allow walking on top, a multi-layer system allowed for floating on the surface if the person remained still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **"Quicksand" Effect**: Attempting to move or swim in multi-layer [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] resulted in a "quicksand" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. If movement begins, the balls gain enough energy to shift, causing the person to sink deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Impossibility of Swimming**: It was determined that conventional swimming is not possible in multiple layers of [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Unlike in a single layer where balls can move past each other, multiple layers cause the balls to get trapped against each other, acting more like a solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This provides significantly more resistance to movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Conclusion

The experiment demonstrated that while [[swimming_in_shade_balls | swimming in a single layer of shade balls]] is physically demanding and hazardous due to impact and drag, [[swimming_in_shade_balls | swimming in multiple layers of shade balls]] is practically impossible due to the balls acting like a solid, creating a "quicksand" effect if motion is attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This reinforces the manufacturer's stance against [[swimming_in_shade_balls | swimming in shade balls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

After the experiment, the 10,000 purchased [[shade_balls_and_their_purpose | shade balls]] were planned to be signed and mailed to supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

The kilogram, a fundamental unit of mass within the [[History and Evolution of the Kilogram | Système International d'Unités (SI units)]], has historically been defined by a physical object. This reliance on a physical artifact has led to significant stability issues, prompting a global effort to redefine the unit based on a fundamental constant of nature.

## The International Prototype Kilogram (IPK)

The kilogram's definition has evolved over time. In 1793, the base unit of mass was defined as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting temperature of ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a>. This concept, initially called the 'grave' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:07">[01:38:07]</a>, was later refined to the mass of a litre of water at 4 degrees Celsius, its densest temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>. However, water was not practical as a mass standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:04">[03:14:04]</a>.

Consequently, in 1799, a pure platinum cylinder, known as the Kilogram of the Archives, was created to represent this mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:04">[03:18:04]</a>. By definition, this artifact *was* the kilogram, rather than merely representing the mass of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:04">[03:29:04]</a>. Ninety years later, in 1889, it was upgraded to a more durable platinum-iridium alloy cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:04">[03:39:04]</a>. This artifact, officially named the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK) or affectionately known as "Le Grand K," remains the definition of the kilogram to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:04">[03:51:04]</a>. It is the only SI unit still defined by a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:04">[04:13:04]</a>.

The IPK is stored under three bell jars, alongside six "sister" kilograms, in a climate-controlled vault in the basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:04">[04:20:04]</a>.

## Problems with Stability

When the IPK was created, 40 identical replicas were also made and sent to countries worldwide to serve as national standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:04">[04:56:04]</a>. While their masses were slightly offset from Big K, these differences were recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:04">[05:01:04]</a>.

However, issues arose when these kilograms were reunited for weigh-ins:
*   **Mass Divergence** In 1948, during a weigh-in, it was discovered that despite being made of the same alloy and stored under similar conditions, the masses of the cylinders had diverged over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:04">[05:12:04]</a>. Even the six sister cylinders stored with Big K had different masses from the IPK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:04">[05:31:04]</a>.
*   **Further Divergence** Forty years later, when brought together again, their masses had diverged even further, by up to approximately 50 micrograms – roughly the weight of a fingerprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:04">[05:36:04]</a>. This divergence occurred despite careful washing before weigh-ins, indicating a physical process changed the cylinders' mass, though the exact mechanism remains speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:04">[05:47:04]</a>.

This instability of the platinum-iridium cylinder's mass over time poses a significant problem, as a unit of measurement cannot change its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:04">[06:04:04]</a>.

## Consequences of Instability

The instability of the kilogram has far-reaching implications:
*   **Impact on Other SI Units** Four out of the seven base SI units depend on the mass of the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:04">[06:13:04]</a>.
*   **Derived Units** Numerous derived units, such as Newtons, Joules, Volts, and Watts, also rely on the kilogram's definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:04">[06:20:04]</a>.
*   **International Standards** Countries that have not adopted the metric system, such as Liberia, Burma, and the US, still rely on the kilogram; for instance, the avoirdupois pound is defined as precisely 0.45359237 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:04">[06:25:04]</a>.

The changing mass of the IPK means that these dependent units also implicitly change their value, creating uncertainty in precise measurements across various scientific and industrial applications.

## Towards a Stable Definition

To eliminate the kilogram's dependence on a physical object, two primary [[Alternate Approaches to Defining the Kilogram | alternative approaches]] are being pursued:

### The Silicon Sphere Method

One approach involves a highly pure silicon-28 sphere, which is the roundest object in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>. If this sphere were the Earth, the difference between its highest mountain and lowest valley would be only about 14 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>. The raw material for this sphere cost 1 million Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>, highlighting the [[Importance and cost of standard reference materials | importance and cost of standard reference materials]] for metrology.

The sphere is made of a perfect crystal of silicon, containing only the silicon-28 isotope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:04">[07:30:04]</a>. Its extreme roundness and known atom spacing allow for precise calculation of the number of atoms within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:04">[07:47:04]</a>. This approach aims to redefine Avogadro's constant based on the number of silicon atoms in the sphere, which would then be used to define the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:04">[08:49:04]</a>. This would allow the kilogram to be defined by a concept rather than a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:04">[09:10:04]</a>, making its definition independent of any specific artifact. The desired definition would be "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:04">[09:20:04]</a>.

### The Watt Balance Method

Another approach involves fixing Planck's constant using a [[mass_and_force_calibration_methods | Watt Balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:04">[09:39:04]</a>. These two approaches are complementary, serving as checks on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:04">[09:45:04]</a>.

If both methods can achieve uncertainties down to about 20 micrograms and show good agreement, the kilogram could be redefined as early as 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:04">[09:52:04]</a>. This would ensure the kilogram becomes an unchanging unit, no longer defined by a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:04">[10:03:04]</a>.

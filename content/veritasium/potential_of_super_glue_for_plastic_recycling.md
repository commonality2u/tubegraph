Scientists are exploring the use of cyanoacrylate, commonly known as super glue, as a novel solution to the global plastic pollution problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. This approach leverages super glue's unique chemical properties to create a fully recyclable plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

## Challenges of Traditional Plastic Recycling

Current methods for recycling plastics often involve shredding, melting, and reforming them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. However, this mechanical and thermal process causes the polymers to degrade, leading to a reduction in quality and the generation of microplastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. A material can only be recycled a limited number of times before it becomes "kind of useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>, eventually still ending up in the environment without breaking down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

## Super Glue's Depolymerization Potential

Unlike many other plastics, super glue possesses a unique property: it can be depolymerized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. When heated to 210 degrees Celsius, super glue breaks back down into its pure monomer molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. These monomers can then be distilled and reactivated to form fresh, high-quality polymer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

This ability to revert to a starting material and then reform a plastic represents a highly sustainable approach to plastic use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

## Overcoming Obstacles for Practical Use

When first discovered, cyanoacrylate was dismissed as a plastic due to its extreme stickiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> and brittleness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Scientists faced these same challenges when considering its use as a recyclable plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>:

### 1. Handleability (Stickiness)
The original problem of cyanoacrylate sticking to everything has been overcome by utilizing modern plastics that are [[polyethylene_and_polypropylene_inertness | chemically inert]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Materials like [[polyethylene_and_polypropylene_inertness | polypropylene]], [[polyethylene_and_polypropylene_inertness | polyethylene]], and Teflon do not activate super glue, making them ideal for handling the monomers without them setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. This allows for practical handling of the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

### 2. Brittleness (Forming Longer Chains)
To reduce the inherent brittleness of super glue, the goal is to form longer, more tangled polymer chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. This problem is addressed in two ways:

*   **Weak Base Initiator**: Using a very weak base, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), as an initiator for the polymerization reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. This provides enough negative ions to start the reaction without creating too many initiation points, which would result in short polymer chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. The slower reaction allows for the formation of longer chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.
*   **Solvent for Mobility**: Introducing a solvent, such as acetone, helps dilute the conditions and provides additional mobility to the monomers and growing polymer chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This allows the polymers to form even longer and more stable chains before solidifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. Once the super glue sets, the acetone evaporates, leaving the new plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

### High Recycling Efficiency
This process yields a high recovery rate, with an average of 93% of the material able to be recovered as super glue monomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. This stands in stark contrast to even the most widely recycled plastics, which degrade in quality and can only be downcycled once or twice before ending up in landfills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

The potential for super glue to revolutionize how plastics are viewed and managed is significant, offering a sustainable solution for materials that have been part of human existence for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

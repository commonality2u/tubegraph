Relativity Space, a startup, has built the world's largest 3D metal printer, named Stargate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Their ambition is to print an entire rocket, including fuel tanks and rocket engines, in just 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach aims to revolutionize [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | aerospace engineering]] by departing from traditional manufacturing methods.

## How 3D Printing Works at Relativity Space

The Stargate printer utilizes a "wire melt team" and a moving print head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It uses plasma discharge that changes its electric waveform every few milliseconds to precisely control the deposition of material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The process involves melting an aluminum alloy wire, similar to spider silk, at temperatures a few hundred degrees above aluminum's melting point of 660Â°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This allows the entire rocket body to be effectively melted together one tiny bit at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The printer works quickly, depositing about 10 inches of wire per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

While large rocket components are printed using wire and plasma arc discharge, smaller, more intricate parts like rocket nozzles are typically 3D printed using metal powder and lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This process involves laying down extremely fine layers of powder (about a 20th the thickness of a human hair) over and over for about a week, resulting in a single, integrated piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

A significant challenge in printing large metal structures is warping as the material cools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. To counter this, Relativity Space developed software that "reverse warps" the part before printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This means the robots print a wobbly, weird shape that becomes perfectly straight, within the tolerance of a human hair, as it cools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## [[benefits_and_challenges_of_3d_printed_rockets | Benefits of 3D Printing Rockets]]

There are several compelling reasons to use 3D printing for rocket manufacturing, overcoming initial frustrations associated with the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Reduced Part Count and Complexity
One of the most significant advantages of 3D printing is its ability to drastically reduce the number of individual parts in a rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
For example, a rocket engine injector, traditionally made of over a thousand individual pieces requiring nine months to assemble, can be 3D printed as a single piece in two weeks, costing 10 times less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
Similarly, rocket nozzles, which conventionally required thousands of small, braze-welded pipes for cooling channels, can now be 3D printed with the channels integrated directly into the single part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
Relativity Space aims for a fully 3D printed rocket to have 100 times fewer parts compared to traditionally built rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Rapid Iteration and Production Speed
[[comparison_between_traditional_and_3d_printed_rocket_production | Traditional rocket manufacturing]] involves building extensive tools to build the rocket itself, like NASA's 170-foot-tall Vertical Assembly Center (VAC) for welding fuel tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This process can take over a decade, with NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) requiring 11 years of development before assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

In contrast, 3D printing allows for rapid iteration and faster production. Relativity Space, just five and a half years old, planned to launch their first rocket within the year of the video's creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
Since there's no fixed tooling, designs can be changed extremely fast, controlled directly by CAD models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. A whole engine can be built in about a month, allowing for continuous improvements and better versions rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This agile approach is likened to "Silicon Valley style" engineering for hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Enhanced Material Strength
Counterintuitively, 3D printed metals can be stronger than traditionally built ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Relativity Space develops its own custom alloys in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. The rapid melting, cooling, and solidification process allows for the creation of very strong alloys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

### New Design Possibilities
[[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printing enables]] engineers to create parts that would be impractical or impossible with traditional techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Smooth, curvy, or bio-inspired designs are as easy to print as ordinary structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. For example, the internal stiffeners in a rocket tank, which prevent buckling, are printed as rings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The next rocket, Terran R, will feature "dragonfly wing type structures" that are only manufacturable through 3D printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This allows for optimal structures that cannot be achieved with conventional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The surface roughness of the printed layers (adding only 5-10% extra mass) causes no aerodynamic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Cost Reduction and Automation
The shift to a fully 3D printed rocket factory means there is no fixed tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the traditional aerospace industry, which often still builds products one at a time by hand, involving hundreds of thousands to millions of individual parts, a paradigm unchanged for 60 years since the Apollo era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
3D printing provides automation for aerospace by assembling parts in the 3D file, then printing them as an integrated assembly, rather than relying on robots to assemble millions of discrete components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. This approach aims to lower costs significantly, with projections of 5 to 100 times cheaper than current rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## [[future_prospects_of_3d_printing_in_space_exploration | Future Vision]]
Relativity Space's first rocket, Terran One, is designed primarily for low Earth orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. However, their larger, next-generation rocket, Terran R, will be capable of sending payloads to the Moon and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The long-term vision of the company is to eventually shrink down their 3D printing technology and "factory of the future" to launch it to Mars and build an industrial base on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

While it is debated whether rockets will always be 3D printed in the future (as dedicated machines might be cheaper for extremely high production volumes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, Relativity Space's pioneering efforts have established them as world experts in 3D printing rocket hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This expertise is secured by their willingness to apply 3D printing in areas previously dismissed by many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to expand the possibilities of human experience by making space more accessible and affordable, contributing to a future where humanity lives across multiple planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

Exploiting vulnerabilities in phone systems has a [[history_of_phone_system_hacks | long history]], evolving from early "phreaking" methods to sophisticated modern attacks leveraging core network protocols like SS7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Early Phone Network Hacks: The "Blue Box"

The earliest significant phone network hacks were pioneered by individuals like Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, whose first startup predated Apple and involved creating a device called a "blue box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. Their product was illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

In the 1970s, long-distance phone calls were extremely expensive, costing up to $25 per minute (adjusted for inflation) for a call from New York to London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. The blue box was designed to trick the telephone company into connecting calls for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Steve Wozniak claimed the ability to control billions of dollars worth of infrastructure with such a device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, and even famously called the Pope pretending to be Henry Kissinger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

### Evolution of Call Connection Systems

Understanding early phone systems helps to illustrate the vulnerabilities exploited by blue box users:
*   **Manual Exchanges (Pre-1920s)**: Most phones had no dialing capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Lifting the receiver caused a voltage drop at the exchange, alerting an operator who would manually connect the call using wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This system was labor-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Rotary Dial Telephones**: Introduced to automate call connections, rotary dials sent pulses down the phone line to correspond with each dialed number (e.g., two pulses for number two) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. These "control signals" determined how lines were connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. However, line capacitance and resistance distorted these pulses over long distances, making automated long-distance calls almost impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   **Touch-Tone Telephones**: To overcome long-distance limitations, phone companies introduced touch-tone or push-button phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. Each button on the keypad emitted a unique combination of two tones (specific frequencies for horizontal and vertical axes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. This "in-band" signaling, where control signals were sent within the voice band, allowed existing telephone networks to receive them regardless of distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

### The Blue Box Exploit
The innovation of in-band signaling created a new vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. When a long-distance call was made, a central node would communicate with a remote node, checking if a line was free by detecting a 2600 Hertz tone from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

Jobs and Wozniak exploited this by:
1.  Dialing a toll-free 1-800 number to access a local node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
2.  Sending a 2600 Hertz tone into the phone, which tricked the remote node into thinking the call had been disconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. The remote node would then start playing the 2600 Hertz tone again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
3.  When they stopped playing the tone, the remote node assumed a new call was being placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
4.  By sending a key pulse tone, the desired phone number, and a start tone, they could connect to any long-distance number for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, as the home node still believed it was connected to a toll-free number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
Some even used a toy whistle from a Cap'n Crunch cereal box, which happened to make the 2600 Hertz frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

## Modern Phone Network Vulnerabilities: [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | Signaling System No. 7 (SS7)]]

To address the vulnerabilities of in-band signaling, telephone companies developed a new protocol: [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | Signaling System No. 7 (SS7)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Introduced in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>, [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] used a separate digital line for control signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>, preventing control of the network via tones on voice lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. Despite its age, [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] is still widely used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

### The "Walled Garden" Vulnerability
[[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]]'s primary function is to facilitate roaming, allowing a phone to connect to foreign networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. For this to work, telcos communicate using unique addresses called Global Titles (GTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Telcos generally accept messages only from GTs with which they have established agreements, creating a "walled garden" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

When [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] was developed in the 1980s, the telecommunications landscape was dominated by a few large, reputable operators who maintained network integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. However, 45 years later, the landscape has dramatically shifted, with over 1200 operators and 4,500 networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. Many of these newer players, including virtual network operators and mass-text services, require [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. Not all of these new entrants are trustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>, and some sell or can be bribed or hacked into providing access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. Access to a single trusted GT is like gaining access to all GTs with which it has partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>, making it possible to buy access for a few thousand dollars per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

### The Three Steps of an [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] Attack
Cybersecurity specialists define three steps for an [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] attack: Infiltrate [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]], Gain Trust, and Attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

1.  **Infiltrate [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]]**: This involves gaining access to the [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] network, often by purchasing access from a less scrupulous operator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.
2.  **Gain Trust**: Even with [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] access and a phone number, a unique 15-digit identifier from the SIM card, called an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), is needed to uniquely identify a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. Messages like "send routing info" or "send routing info for SM" are used to collect the IMSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. Obtaining the IMSI is crucial for appearing trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.
3.  **Attack**: Once infiltration and trust are established, various attacks are possible.

#### Call Interception
Attackers can seize control of a phone number by tricking the network into believing the target's phone is roaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. This allows the attacker to rewrite the number being called to one they control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>. In a demonstration, Linus Tech Tips' phone calls were intercepted without his phone ever ringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. The attacker could even act as a middleman, recording calls while simultaneously routing them to the intended recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>. The only information needed for this type of attack is the target's phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.

#### SMS Interception and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Bypass
Similar to call interception, attackers can trick the network into thinking the target is roaming, rerouting their text messages to the attacker's GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>. This allows them to steal one-time passwords used in two-factor authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>. This attack works until the subscriber interacts with their phone network, which then reconnects to the correct GT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>. A few seconds are enough to receive a one-time password and gain access to an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>. For example, a YouTube account's 2FA code was intercepted, allowing the attacker to log in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>. The target would never know they missed the messages or that they were intercepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>. This is serious because SMS 2FA is often the default, and sometimes the only, option even for sensitive accounts like bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>.

#### Location Tracking
Attackers can track a target's location by targeting the switching center connected to the device's IMSI and issuing a command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>. [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] does not rely on GPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>. An [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] location request simply identifies the cell tower the target is connected to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>. In urban areas with many towers, this can pinpoint a location to within a hundred meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>, allowing attackers to determine if someone is at home or work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>. This method was used in 2016 to track US Congressman Ted Lieu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a>.

## [[impact_of_mobile_phone_security_breaches | Impact of Mobile Phone Security Breaches]]

The threats from [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] attacks are real and can have devastating consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>.

*   **Princess Latifa Case**: Princess Latifa of Dubai, who claimed to be held captive by her father, was abducted after her yacht captain became the victim of a coordinated [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] attack aimed at pinpointing his location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Attackers leased multiple GTs and sent numerous IMSI and location requests. While some requests were blocked by firewalls, unblocked requests from a nearby US GT likely provided critical information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Theft**: Criminals have used [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] to intercept SMS 2FA codes and empty millions of dollars from bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>.
*   **Government Surveillance**: [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] is widely used for surveillance. The NSO Group, known for its Pegasus spyware, acquired an [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] tracking company in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>. [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] helps gather basic device and software data for costly "zero-click" hacks (over $4 million per exploit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>. Experts have found that 20-30 VIPs, including cybersecurity chiefs, are constantly under [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] surveillance on some foreign networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a>. More than 2.5 million tracking attempts occur per year, primarily targeting individuals of interest to state agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:00">[25:08:00]</a>.

## Responses and Challenges

In 2014, security researchers Karsten Nohl and Tobias Engel publicly exposed [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] vulnerabilities, revealing how easy it was for "ragtag gangs of hackers" to exploit the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:03:00">[26:03:00]</a>. After their conference, German telcos immediately started refusing "anytime interrogation" requests, a command that had no legitimate purpose and was heavily abused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:00">[26:33:00]</a>. However, over 150 other messages still need to be blocked to secure [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>.

[[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] remains the backbone of 2G and 3G communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>. Phasing out 2G and 3G has caused problems; for instance, mandatory emergency call buttons in EU cars use 2G and 3G SIM cards for cost-cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:00]</a>. Even in metropolitan areas, users frequently rely on 3G when 4G connectivity drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:32:00">[27:32:00]</a>.

Despite the 5G signaling protocol being more secure and many networks using 5G technology, [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] is still the de facto standard for routing calls between networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>. There hasn't been a global push to replace [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] with newer versions due to "first-mover disadvantage" – networks prefer to be among the last to adopt new technologies once everyone else is already connected, to gain full benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:41:00">[27:41:00]</a>. This creates significant inertia, making it difficult to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:00">[28:25:00]</a>. Experts estimate it could be another 10 to 20 years until [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] networks are finally switched off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:35:00">[28:35:00]</a>. This highlights a broader issue of [[technological_obsolescence_and_innovation | technological obsolescence and innovation]] challenges.

## [[steps_individuals_can_take_to_protect_against_ss7_attacks | Steps Individuals Can Take to Protect Against SS7 Attacks]]

While there is little an individual can do about location tracking as long as they have a SIM card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>, [[steps_individuals_can_take_to_protect_against_ss7_attacks | individuals can take steps to protect against certain SS7 vulnerabilities]]:
*   **Avoid SMS-based 2FA**: Choose alternatives to SMS-based two-factor authentication, such as authenticator apps or hardware tokens, so messages cannot be intercepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">[29:11:00]</a>.
*   **Use Encrypted Calling Services**: If concerned about phone tapping, use encrypted internet-based calling services like Signal or WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>.

The prevalence of [[ss7_protocol_and_its_vulnerabilities | SS7]] privacy intrusions and abuse cases underscore a philosophical debate about privacy in a technologically advanced world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>.

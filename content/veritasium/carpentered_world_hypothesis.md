The [[interpretation_of_visual_cues_and_reality | carpentered world hypothesis]] is a theory explaining why certain optical illusions, such as the Ames window illusion, occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. It posits that our brains are accustomed to environments filled with rectangular shapes and 90-degree angles, which influences how we interpret visual information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Origin and Concept
The hypothesis was proposed by Adelbert Ames, who created the Ames window illusion in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Ames, originally a visual artist, was fascinated by how people perceive shapes and shading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. He observed that humans are typically surrounded by "rectangular boxes" like houses, rooms, doors, windows, tables, and chairs, which primarily feature 90-degree angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Even though the images that form on our retinas from these objects are often trapezoids, our brains, through extensive experience, expect them to be rectangles and right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This prior knowledge allows our brains to infer depth information, which is usually accurate in our "rectilinear world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. However, this inference can lead to illusions when presented with a trapezoidal object that our brain assumes to be rectangular, such as the Ames window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Experimental Evidence
If the [[interpretation_of_visual_cues_and_reality | carpentered world hypothesis]] holds true, individuals with less exposure to rectangular environments should be less susceptible to illusions like the Ames window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

To test this, Harvard psychologists conducted an experiment in South Africa in 1957, involving 80 children aged 10 to 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>:
*   **Urban Group**: 40 children from the city of Durban, living in an environment full of rectangular buildings, doors, and windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Rural Group**: 40 children from nearby rural communities, who lived in round huts with few prominent 90-degree angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

When seated 10 feet away with both eyes open from the rotating Ames window:
*   60% of the urban group perceived the window oscillating back and forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   Only 17.5% of the rural group saw the same oscillating motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

These results were consistent with the [[interpretation_of_visual_cues_and_reality | carpentered world hypothesis]], suggesting that children with less experience of rectangles were less likely to fall for the illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Limitations and Further Considerations
Despite the supportive evidence, the [[interpretation_of_visual_cues_and_reality | carpentered world hypothesis]] is not the complete explanation for these illusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
When the viewing conditions were altered (seated 20 feet away with one eye closed):
*   90% of all participants, regardless of their background, saw the window oscillating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   There was no significant difference between the urban and rural groups under these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

This indicates that other factors beyond experience with rectangles must be at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. For example, similar illusions can be created without any straight lines, such as the de Heer circle, which also appears to oscillate when continuously rotating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Both the Ames window and the de Heer circle utilize [[interpretation_of_visual_cues_and_reality | anamorphosis]], a technique that distorts projections of objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Ultimately, these illusions highlight that our perceptions are not transparent representations of external reality and are constantly faced with ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Our brains subconsciously make decisions about which of infinite possibilities we are observing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This concept extends beyond specific illusions to general human perception and can be a metaphor for how people interpret information and arrive at different conclusions about reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

The accepted value for the speed of light in a vacuum is precisely 299,792,458 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Since 1983, this value has been used to [[definition_of_the_speed_of_light | define]] the length of a meter: it is the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458ths of a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While this definition ensures the speed of light is an exact number, the one-way speed of light has never actually been measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Why Measuring Oneway Speed is Difficult

Measuring speed typically involves knowing the distance between two points and the time it takes to travel that distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. For example, to measure the speed of a baseball, one can divide the distance traveled by the time taken, often using a high-speed camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, this method cannot be directly applied to light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### The Clock Synchronization Problem
The fundamental challenge in measuring the one-way speed of light is the inability to synchronize two clocks at different locations without already knowing the one-way speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

Consider the following thought experiments:
*   **Single Clock:** If a laser beam is fired for one kilometer from a starting point, and a timer is started at the instant of firing and stopped when it hits the end, it's impossible to know when the light reaches the one-kilometer mark if the clock is at the starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Two Clocks:** Using two clocks, one at the laser and one at the end that automatically stops upon detecting light, presents the problem of synchronizing these two clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Wired Synchronization:** Connecting the clocks via a wire and sending a pulse would seem to synchronize them. However, the pulse travels at the speed of light, creating a time delay equal to the very value being sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Subtracting this delay is circular, as it requires prior knowledge of the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Moving Synchronized Clocks:** Starting with synchronized clocks together and then moving one to the end point also fails. Special relativity dictates that a moving clock ticks slower relative to a stationary observer, leading to desynchronization by the time it reaches the destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Even moving them very slowly might not negate this, as time dilation itself could depend on the speed of light in different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Equal and Opposite Motion:** Moving two synchronized clocks apart with equal and opposite speeds also wouldn't work if the one-way speed of light differs by direction, because time dilation would also depend on direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### The Only Measured Speed: Roundtrip
The only solution that avoids the synchronization problem is to use a single clock and reflect the light back to the starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This measures the full round trip, or two-way, speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This was the method used by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1849, who measured the speed of light to be 313,000 kilometers per second, within 5% of the accepted value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Conceptual Implications of the Oneway Speed
The inability to measure the one-way speed of light opens the door to fascinating theoretical possibilities:

### Asymmetrical Speed of Light
It is theoretically possible that the speed of light is different in different directions. For instance, light could travel at half the speed of 'c' in one direction and be instantaneous on the return journey, yet the observed roundtrip time would still be consistent with 'c' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This is because there's no way to distinguish between these scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

This concept suggests a possible preferred direction through spacetime, an asymmetry in the universe akin to the matter-antimatter imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Physicists have developed internally consistent theories where the speed of light varies from a few percent up to the extreme of `c`/2 in one direction and infinitely fast in the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Einstein Synchronization Convention
The idea that light travels at the same speed in all directions is a convention, not an experimentally verified fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Albert Einstein himself pointed this out in his 1905 paper, "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. To compare times measured by clocks at different locations, A and B, Einstein stipulated "by definition that the time required by light to travel from A to B equals the time it requires to travel from B to A" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This "Einstein synchronization convention" is a chosen stipulation to arrive at a definition of simultaneity, not a hypothesis about the physical nature of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Consequently, any light clock, often used in physics classes to illustrate concepts, always bounces light back and forth, implicitly using the two-way speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The two-way speed of light is the only value guaranteed to be constant for all inertial observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Impact on Simultaneity
If the speed of light were asymmetric, it would dramatically alter our understanding of simultaneity between distant points. For example, if a message from Earth took 20 minutes to reach Mars (due to `c`/2 speed) and returned instantaneously, and both parties used the Einstein convention, their clocks would be out of sync by 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. An observer on Earth would be seeing Mars in real-time, while an observer on Mars would be seeing Earth as it was 20 minutes ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This discrepancy is undetectable and uncorrectable through communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Debunked Measurement Attempts
For over a century, scientists have attempted to measure the one-way speed of light directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. A paper published in the American Journal of Physics in 2009 claimed to measure it, but was subsequently debunked for actually measuring the two-way speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

Other proposed methods also fail:
*   **High-speed camera:** Observing light pass through an object with a trillion-frames-per-second camera would still involve seeing the light bounce back to the camera, thus measuring the two-way speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Fiber optic cable:** Sending light through a long fiber optic cable still involves numerous internal reflections and averages out to a round trip, not a one-way measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Central Synchronizing Device:** A device sending simultaneous pulses to two clocks would perfectly synchronize them *if* the speed of light is the same in both directions. If the speed is different, one clock would be ahead, but precisely by the amount that would make any measurement of the one-way speed appear to be 'c' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This is why [[definition_of_the_speed_of_light | GPS synchronized clocks]] also cannot solve the problem; the entire GPS system assumes the speed of light is constant in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook
The fact that the one-way speed of light cannot be independently measured and makes no difference to the laws of physics sparks an ongoing debate since 1905 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Some physicists advocate for Occam's razor, suggesting it's simpler to assume light travels at the same speed in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Most working physicists accept this convention and proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

However, the fact that it is a convention, not an empirically verified fact, remains significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. The unknowable nature of the one-way speed of light and its implications for simultaneity raise fundamental questions about the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. It's possible that this "odd quirk" of the universe could be an important clue for future breakthroughs in physics, connecting [[experiments_and_predictions_related_to_general_relativity | General Relativity]], Quantum Mechanics, space, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

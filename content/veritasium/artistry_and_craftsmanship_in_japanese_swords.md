Japanese swords are renowned globally for their exceptional strength and sharpness, capable even of slicing a bullet in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The method of making these swords has remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years, with every step performed by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. They are still considered among the best in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, and one from the 16th century was appraised at $105 million, making it the most expensive sword ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Historical Context and Materials

The [[history_of_japanese_swords | history of Japanese sword making]] dates back about 3,000 years, with early swords made from bronze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, has a low melting point, making it suitable for smelting in regular pottery kilns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. However, bronze is too soft to hold a sharp edge for long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Around 1,200 years ago, during the Heian period, Japanese sword makers shifted to steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, is significantly stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

While older steel artifacts have been found in places like Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) dating back nearly 4,000 years, Japan was late to steel production, largely due to its volcanic geology lacking the typical sedimentary iron oxide deposits found elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Until the 8th century, Japan imported metals, including steel, from China and Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Raw Material Sourcing: Iron Sand

Given the scarcity of conventional iron ore, Japanese swordsmiths developed unique methods for sourcing raw iron. They relied on [[iron_sand_collection_and_smelting_in_japan | iron sand]] found in rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. As mountains weather, iron oxides in igneous rocks break apart and wash downstream, eventually becoming part of the sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Recognizing that iron oxides are denser than other minerals, they accumulate where a river's direction or speed changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

To enhance this natural concentration, the Japanese deliberately created diversions in rivers, damming off sections and dragging sand into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This method allows for the collection of iron sands with up to 80% iron oxides by weight, making it a highly concentrated and pure source for steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Smelting: The Tatara Method

The steel for the best Japanese swords is made using the ancient [[iron_sand_collection_and_smelting_in_japan | Tatara method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. In the Shimane province of Japan, a smelter is lit for only one night each year, producing steel in the same way it was done 1,300 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

The process begins with ceremonial prayers and the lighting of the fire by a Shinto priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Workers stay for at least 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Charcoal, essentially pure carbon, is used to heat the iron oxides to over 1,250 degrees Celsius, breaking the bonds with oxygen to yield pure iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The addition of a small amount of carbon from the charcoal creates steel, an incredibly strong alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Iron sand is mixed with water before being added to the flame; too little water causes it to fly up, while too much risks a kiln explosion due to water vapor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This mixing is done by feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

The smelter reaches temperatures up to 1,500 degrees Celsius, just below iron's melting point, so the iron remains soft and malleable, clumping into a large block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Impurities like sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon oxides combine with carbon from the charcoal, melting at a lower temperature than iron and flowing to the bottom as "slag," which is periodically removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

After about 21 hours of smelting, involving hundreds of kilograms of iron sand and charcoal, a 100-kilogram block of steel, iron, and slag remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Only about a third of this block is high-quality enough for sword making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The steel is then sorted by quality and carbon content, a process still done by eye and part of the swordsmith certification exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

## Forging the Sword: [[steel_alloying_and_sword_forging_techniques | Folding and Alloying]]

The [[traditional_japanese_sword_making_process | forging]] of the sword begins by heating the steel in a coal oven with hand-pumped bellows until it is soft and malleable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. The master swordsmith then flattens the steel with hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

A critical step is repeatedly bending the flattened steel back on itself and hammering it together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. This folding serves two crucial purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>:
1.  **Impurity Distribution:** It spreads out impurities, ensuring uniform consistency and eliminating weak points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
2.  **Grain Creation:** It gives the steel a "grain," reinforcing the sword in the direction it will be struck in combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
A bonus of this process is the creation of beautiful patterns due to slight oxidation and folding, with some swords having over a billion layers (achieved with about 30 folds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Typically, a sword is folded 10 to 13 times, resulting in thousands of layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

A Japanese blade is not made from a single block of steel. Different parts of the blade use steel with varying carbon content to achieve specific properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Higher carbon content makes steel harder and more rigid but also more brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Therefore:
*   The **edge** is made of high-carbon steel for hardness and rigidity to maintain a sharp edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   The **spine** (back) is typically made of lower-carbon steel, allowing the sword to flex without breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
This is achieved by welding together pieces of steel with different carbon contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

## Quenching and the Iconic Curve

After the sword is hammered into its straight blade shape, it is covered in a layer of clayâ€”thick on the spine and thin on the blade's edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. It's then heated in the furnace and rapidly cooled in water, a process known as quenching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

The varying clay thickness causes different cooling rates:
*   The **spine**, covered in thick clay, cools slowly, allowing carbon atoms to leave the iron matrix, forming ferrite and cementite, which combine to create perlite. Perlite is a mostly soft and ductile form of steel that forms the sword's spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
*   The **blade's edge**, with its thin clay layer, cools rapidly, trapping more carbon in the iron lattice. This changes the lattice structure to tetragonal, creating martensite, an incredibly hard form of steel ideal for the sword's edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

The tetragonal lattice structure of martensite also takes up more space, causing the edge of the blade to expand relative to the spine, thus curving the sword backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This formation of martensite is responsible for the iconic curve of a samurai sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. The boundary between these different types of steel is visible in a finished sword as a color difference, known as "hamon" (edge pattern) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. About a third of all blades shatter during this quenching process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

After quenching, the sword is briefly placed back in the forge to evaporate any remaining water and slightly temper the sword, making it less brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

## Sharpening and Finishing

Once forged, the sword is sent to a polisher. The sharpening and polishing are done entirely by hand using whetstones of varying coarseness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. This meticulous process can take up to a month for a single sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Occasionally, swords are also engraved with intricate patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

The result of this extensive [[traditional_japanese_sword_making_process | traditional Japanese sword making process]] is a weapon and a piece of art that embodies centuries of accumulated knowledge and dedication. The profound care, attention, and expertise required at every stage, from gathering and refining iron sand to smelting, forging, and sharpening, are what make Japanese swords so highly prized even centuries later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

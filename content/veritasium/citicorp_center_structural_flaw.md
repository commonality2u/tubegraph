From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

The Citicorp Center, opened in 1977, was initially hailed as an engineering marvel and an "acrobatic act of architecture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:14">[10:53:14]</a>. However, less than a year after its opening, in the summer of 1978, its structural engineer, Bill LeMessurier, made a terrifying discovery: the cutting-edge skyscraper had a fatal flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Winds of just 110 kilometers per hour could cause it to collapse in the middle of Manhattan, potentially killing thousands of people living and working in the surrounding area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Hurricane season was only weeks away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

## Design and Innovation

In the 1960s, financial giant Citicorp sought to build a new headquarters in Manhattan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>. The chosen city block included St. Peter's Church, which refused to relocate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The church stipulated that any new Citicorp building must incorporate the church, giving it a separate identity and ensuring two-thirds of the space above it remained open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

Architect Hugh Stubbins designed the tower, and Bill LeMessurier was hired as the structural engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. To maximize floor area while accommodating the church, LeMessurier proposed constructing the skyscraper on stilts, not at the corners, but at the center of each face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This unusual column placement created a significant engineering challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

LeMessurier's innovative solution involved using [[chevron_bracing_and_tuning_mass_dampers | chevron bracing]]â€”six layers of diagonal braces up each face of the tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. These chevrons would transfer forces to the middle of each face and down to the stilts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. By removing columns at the top and middle of each chevron, every tier functioned as a separate unit, connected only to the braces and central core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This unique system efficiently handled gravity and wind loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

The lightweight nature of the building, a result of the chevron bracing system, made it prone to swaying in the wind, which could be uncomfortable for occupants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. LeMessurier addressed this with a [[chevron_bracing_and_tuning_mass_dampers | tuned mass damper (TMD)]], a technology previously used in bridges, power lines, and ships but never before in a building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. The Citicorp TMD was a 400-ton concrete mass, 29 feet square and eight feet thick, installed on the top floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. It damped the building's oscillations by moving out of phase, transferring kinetic energy from the building and dissipating it through viscous dampers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. This innovation saved approximately $4 million by reducing the need for 2,800 tons of additional structural steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

## Discovery of the Flaw

The first hint of a problem emerged in May 1978, when LeMessurier learned that the chevron connections had been bolted, not welded, as originally intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. The contractor had suggested using bolts to save a quarter of a million dollars, and LeMessurier's firm had agreed, assuming it was a minor change since the braces were primarily under compression from gravity loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

Around a month later, a student's phone call prompted LeMessurier to re-evaluate the building's design, specifically concerning wind loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. While discussing wind loads from all directions for another project, LeMessurier considered how the Citicorp Center would perform under "quartering winds," which hit a corner of the building rather than straight on one of its faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.

His re-calculation revealed that quartering winds would increase forces on some diagonals by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. This increase was critical because the connections were bolted, not welded, and his firm's original calculations for the number of bolts did not account for diagonal wind loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. Furthermore, his firm had considered the braces "minor structural elements" and had not used the correct factor of safety, underestimating the tension in the braces by underestimating the gravity load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>. For example, a brace needing 14 bolts had only four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>.

## Severity of the Risk

LeMessurier's subsequent dynamic analysis with Alan Davenport at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel revealed that stresses could increase up to 60% more than originally anticipated under moving conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>. The weakest joints were at the building's 30th floor, and their failure would lead to the entire building's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>.

Historically, a storm strong enough to tear the building apart occurred every 67 years, but this assumed the tuned mass damper was working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>. If power was knocked out, even 110-kilometer-per-hour winds blowing for just five minutes would cause collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>. The chance of such a storm happening in any given year was one in 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. Just a year before the building's completion, Hurricane Belle had brought 110 km/h winds to New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.

LeMessurier realized the building had a 100% probability of total collapse by the end of the century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. Facing potential professional ruin and mass panic, he considered suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>. However, with thousands of lives at risk, he chose to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.

## Project Serene: The Repair

After consulting lawyers and experts, LeMessurier informed architect Stubbins and Citicorp chairman Walter Wriston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. Within hours, emergency generators were acquired for the TMD, which now became a crucial component for stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>. The confidential repair plan was initially called Project Pandora, then renamed "Special Engineering Review of Events Nobody Envisioned," or Project Serene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>.

Each night, after office workers left, welders removed sheetrock, welded two 5-centimeter-thick, 2-meter-long steel plates on each of the over 200 critical joints, and then replaced the walls before morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. The repairs began with the weakest joints on the 30th floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>.

Despite the risk of collapse impacting thousands in the building and potentially toppling other structures, the decision was made not to inform the public or office workers to prevent mass panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>. Strain gauges were fitted to monitor the building's movements, with data sent to a command center eight blocks away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.

A lucky break came when a New York Times reporter tried to contact LeMessurier, but all New York newspapers went on strike until October, creating a "press blackout" that lasted through the repair period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:00">[24:54:00]</a>.

In late August, Hurricane Ella brewed in the Caribbean with winds reaching 200 km/h, causing city officials to prepare a 10-block evacuation plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a>. After 24 tense hours, Ella veered off into the sea at the last minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:37:00">[26:37:00]</a>.

The repairs were completed in October, just six weeks after LeMessurier informed Citicorp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>. The cost, between $4 and $5 million, was considered acceptable as Citicorp had previously approved an earlier design costing more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>. The building could now withstand a one-in-1000-year storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a>.

## Legacy and Controversy

For almost two decades, the secret of the flaw was confined to a small inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>. In 1995, *The New Yorker* finally revealed Project Serene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:00">[27:29:00]</a>. Far from being vilified, LeMessurier was widely praised for his ethical conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35:00">[27:35:00]</a>. After the article, New York updated its building code to require quartering wind calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a>. The Citicorp case is now taught globally as a model of good [[impact_of_citicorp_repairs_on_engineering_standards | engineering ethics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:23:00">[28:23:00]</a>.

The story of the mysterious student who prompted LeMessurier's re-evaluation remained controversial for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:39:00">[28:39:00]</a>. Initially, it was believed to be Diane Hartley, a Princeton undergraduate whose thesis on Citicorp highlighted the absence of quartering wind considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>. However, she never spoke to LeMessurier directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:24:00">[30:24:00]</a>. In 2011, Lee DeCarolis came forward, stating he was the New Jersey Institute of Technology student who made the call, aligning with LeMessurier's own account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>.

Despite the positive outcome, some entities involved remain reluctant to discuss the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:00">[31:16:00]</a>. LeMessurier Associates' project description for Citicorp does not mention the repairs, and Boston Properties, the building's current owner (renamed 601 Lexington), refused comment and filming access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45:00">[31:45:00]</a>. A 2021 study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded that perpendicular winds, not quartering winds, were more demanding for a building like Citicorp, though their analysis did not include Citicorp's specific internal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00:00">[32:00:00]</a>.

Regardless, LeMessurier's actions are widely lauded within the engineering field for exemplifying the responsibility professionals have beyond themselves, especially when a social risk like a collapsing building could "kill thousands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:08:00">[33:08:00]</a>.

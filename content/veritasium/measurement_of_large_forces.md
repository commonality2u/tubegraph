Measuring extremely large forces accurately is crucial for various applications, from testing jet engines to ensuring the safety of aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. While an apple weighs about 1 newton, jet engine thrust can reach 570,000 newtons, and the Saturn V rocket produced 33,360,000 newtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The World's Largest Force Measurement Machine

At the forefront of large force measurement is a specialized "dead weight machine" managed by Rick Seifarth, a physical scientist in the Mass and Force Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This machine is designed to apply and measure forces up to 4,448,222 newtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, which is equivalent to exactly 1,000,000 pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This capacity, 4.45 meganewtons, makes it the largest machine of its type in the world, and it is believed to be where the largest mass objects are ever [[calibration_of_force_sensors | calibrated]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. A separate machine also exists with a 13.3 meganewton (three million pounds force) capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### How it Works

The machine operates by using 20 carefully [[calibration_of_force_sensors | calibrated]] 50,000-pound masses located below ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. These weights are used to [[calibration_of_force_sensors | calibrate]] force sensors, also known as force transducers, in the lab upstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

1.  A force sensor is placed on a compression head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  A hydraulic ram in the attic lifts a green lifting frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
3.  When the force transducer contacts a red loading frame, it begins to lift the weights downstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
4.  As the lifting frame rises, more and more of the 50,000-pound weights become suspended by the force sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
5.  Since the exact force created by these weights is known, the readouts from the force transducer can be precisely [[calibration_of_force_sensors | calibrated]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

These [[calibration_of_force_sensors | calibrated]] devices are then used in the field, for example, embedded in test stands to monitor forces when rockets are fired up, ramped up, or ramped down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## [[minimizing_uncertainty_in_force_measurement | Minimizing Uncertainty in Force Measurement]]

Precision is paramount in large force measurement. Each 50,000-pound weight is known to within several American nickels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For example, one piece is specified as approximately 50,036.27 pounds of mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Calibration Process for Weights

The tiny uncertainty in these massive weights is achieved by tracing their mass back to the fundamental mass standard, K20, the United States' primary [[alternative_approaches_to_defining_the_kilogram | kilogram]] definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This involves a hierarchical comparison process:

*   Starting with K20, combinations of known weights are compared to larger unknown weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   For instance, a single 5-kilogram mass is compared to two 2-kilogram and one 1-kilogram masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   At a certain point, the process converts to pounds, moving from 50-pound masses to 500 pounds, then 2,500 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   Using a scale in the floor, this extends to 10,000 pounds, 20,000 pounds, and finally 30,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   Combinations of these huge weights are then used to [[calibration_of_force_sensors | calibrate]] the 50,000-pound masses that make up the main weight stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Accounting for Environmental Factors

To guarantee a vertical force vector with an uncertainty of 0.0005% (five parts per million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, meaning within five pounds at a million pounds of applied force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, environmental factors must be meticulously considered:

*   **Gravitational Acceleration:** The local gravitational acceleration is slightly less than Earth's standard gravity, requiring an additional 600 pounds to be accounted for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Buoyant Force:** The masses displace 125 pounds of air, creating a buoyant force that must be counteracted by adding a further 125 pounds to reach the precise million pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### The Importance of Physical Testing

The existence of such a precise and large-scale machine highlights the axiom that "one physical test is worth a thousand expert opinions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. For critical applications like aircraft manufacturing, relying on generalized data with a 10% uncertainty is unacceptable; measurements must be incredibly precise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

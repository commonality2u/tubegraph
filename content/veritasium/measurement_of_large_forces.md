Measuring extremely large forces accurately is crucial for various industries, particularly in aerospace and engineering. While an apple weighs approximately 1 newton and a jet engine produces about 570,000 newtons, the Saturn V rocket that launched people to the moon generated a thrust of 33,360,000 newtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The challenge lies in accurately measuring forces of this magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Dead Weight Machine

Rick Seifarth, a physical scientist in the [[mass_and_force_calibration_methods | Mass and Force Group]], manages a specialized dead weight machine designed for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This machine can apply up to 4,448,222 newtons, which is precisely 1,000,000 pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It consists of twenty 50,000-pound increments, cumulatively reaching 4.45 meganewtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Rick suggests these may be the largest mass objects ever calibrated globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Another machine of its type, capable of 13.3 meganewtons (three million pounds force), is noted as the biggest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Operational Mechanism

The machine operates by utilizing 20 carefully [[calibrating_force_sensors_and_transducers | calibrated]] masses located below ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Their combined weight is used to [[calibrating_force_sensors_and_transducers | calibrate force sensors]], also known as Force Transducers, in the lab upstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The calibration process involves:
1.  Placing a force transducer on a compression head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  A hydraulic ram in the attic raises a green lifting frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
3.  As the force transducer contacts a red loading frame, it begins to lift the weights downstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
4.  As the lifting frame continues to rise, more of the 50,000-pound weights become suspended by the force sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
5.  Since the weights create an accurately known force, the force transducer's readouts can be precisely [[calibrating_force_sensors_and_transducers | calibrated]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Calibrated devices are then used in the field, for instance, embedded in test stands to monitor rocket thrust during firing, ensuring precise power levels are achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Precision and Uncertainty

Minimizing uncertainty is paramount in this field. Each 50,000-pound mass, equivalent to ten minivans, has its exact value known to within several American nickels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This minuscule uncertainty is measured with respect to the very definition of the kilogram, using K20, the United States fundamental mass standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

The [[mass_and_force_calibration_methods | calibration]] process involves:
1.  Comparing combinations of known weights, starting with K20, to larger unknown weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
2.  Gradually working up from kilograms (e.g., a 5-kilogram mass compared to two 2s and a 1) to pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
3.  Progressing through 50-pound, 500-pound, 2500-pound, and using a scale in the floor, to 10,000, 20,000, and finally 30,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
4.  These large calibrated weights are then used to [[calibrating_force_sensors_and_transducers | calibrate]] the 50,000-pound masses of the weight stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

The uncertainty attached to the vertical force vector generated by these weights is remarkably low: 0.0005%, or five parts per million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This means that at a full one million pounds of applied force, the accuracy is guaranteed to be within five pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Environmental Considerations

Achieving such precision requires accounting for environmental factors:
*   **Gravitational Acceleration:** The local gravitational acceleration, which is slightly less than Earth's standard gravity, must be considered. An additional 600 pounds are required to compensate for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Buoyant Force:** The buoyant force from the air displaced by the masses must also be counteracted. Since the masses displace 125 pounds of air, a further 125 pounds must be added to reach the target million pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## The Necessity of Physical Testing

The existence of such a machine highlights the critical [[importance_of_accurate_force_measurement_in_aerospace | importance of accurate force measurement in aerospace]] and other high-stakes applications. Rather than generalizing or extrapolating measurements, physical testing is indispensable. As an axiom states, "one physical test is worth a thousand expert opinions," a truth proven repeatedly in physical testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. For critical applications like aircraft construction, engineers demand uncertainties in measurements to be extremely low, not a mere 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Spinning flywheels demonstrate fascinating principles of physics, particularly related to [[gyroscopic_precession_and_its_effects | gyroscopic precession]]. Experiments conducted with a large, heavy flywheel illustrate how its rotational motion dramatically alters its apparent behavior under gravity.

## Apparatus Overview

The experiments utilize a significant piece of equipment: a 40-pound (19 kilogram) flywheel attached to the end of a one-meter-long shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Without the flywheel spinning, it is virtually impossible to hold this shaft horizontally with just one hand at its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Gyroscopic Effects

### Horizontal Hold Experiment

When the flywheel is spun up to several thousand RPM, it becomes possible to hold the shaft horizontally with a single hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The shaft remains horizontal, and the wheel appears almost weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Instead of gravity pulling the wheel down as expected, the weight of the wheel creates a torque that causes it to move around in a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This phenomenon is identified as [[gyroscopic_precession_and_its_effects | gyroscopic precession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Overhead Lift Experiment

Lifting the flywheel overhead with one hand demonstrates a similar effect:
*   **Without spinning**: Lifting the non-spinning flywheel overhead with one hand is extremely difficult and requires significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **With spinning**: When the flywheel is spinning at high speed, lifting it overhead feels "incredibly light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. It feels as though it "wants to go up by itself," requiring much less perceived force than its actual weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Weight Measurement Experiment

To further investigate the perceived "lightness," an experiment can be conducted using a scale:
*   A person's weight alone might be approximately 72 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   When the person holds the non-spinning 19 kg flywheel, their combined weight on the scale increases to about 91 kilograms (72 kg + 19 kg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   A prediction is posed for what the scale reading would be (more, less, or equal to 91 kg) while lifting the *spinning* flywheel over one's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

The field of robotics has seen significant advancements in maze-solving capabilities, particularly exemplified by the annual [[micromouse_competition_history_and_rules | Micromouse competition]]. This evolution highlights how [[strategies_for_complex_problem_solving | strategies for complex problem solving]] have adapted to both software logic and hardware constraints to achieve optimal performance.

## Early Inspiration: Theseus
The concept of an intelligent maze-solving machine dates back to 1952, when mathematician Claude Shannon constructed an electronic mouse named Theseus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The intelligence of Theseus was embedded within the maze itself, using telephone relay switches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The mouse, essentially a magnet on wheels, followed an electromagnet controlled by the relays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Theseus explored the maze using a "trial and error" strategy, registering information in its memory as it found the correct path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Once a path was explored, it could go directly to the goal without false turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Theseus is often cited as one of the first examples of machine learning and is credited with inspiring the entire field of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Micromouse Competition and Early Strategies
The [[micromouse_competition_history_and_rules | Micromouse competition]] began in 1977, after the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) misunderstood a rumor about a French electronic mouse contest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Unlike the early electronic mice, the IEEE envisioned truly autonomous robots capable of intelligent behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. A Micromouse must be fully autonomous, without internet connection, GPS, remote control, or external nudging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Its computing, motors, sensors, and power supply must fit within a 25-centimeter frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Competitors initially explored various maze-solving algorithms:

*   **Wall-Following**: An early simple strategy involved the mouse placing one hand along a wall and following it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This method was effective in the first finals, leading to a wall-following mouse taking home gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. However, competition rules evolved, moving the goal away from edges and adding free-standing walls, which rendered this strategy ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

*   **Depth-First Search**: This strategy involves the mouse running as deep into the maze as it can, noting every fork in the road, and only turning back when it reaches a dead end or a loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. While it will eventually reach the goal, it does not guarantee the shortest route, as it might miss shortcuts by only turning back when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

*   **Breadth-First Search**: The sibling to depth-first search, this algorithm *would* find the shortest path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. It involves the mouse running down one branch of an intersection, reaching the next, then returning to check the skipped path before moving to the next layer of intersections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The significant drawback is the extensive backtracking required, which means rerunning paths dozens of times, often making it slower than simply searching the whole maze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## The Dominance of Flood Fill
The most popular and effective [[strategies_for_complex_problem_solving | strategy for complex problem solving]] in Micromouse is the **Flood Fill** algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This algorithm operates on an "optimistic journey" principle:

1.  **Initial Map**: On its first run, the mouse assumes the maze has no walls, drawing the shortest path to the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
2.  **Dynamic Updating**: When the mouse inevitably encounters a wall not on its optimistic map, it marks the wall and updates its internal map to reflect a new shortest path to the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This process of running, updating, and continually "beelining" for the goal is efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
3.  **Distance Mapping**: Under the hood, the Micromouse marks the distance from every square in the maze to the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. It follows a trail of decreasing numbers down to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. When a wall is hit, the numbers on the map are updated to show the new shortest distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This process, resembling flooding the maze with water, gives the algorithm its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
4.  **Efficiency**: While flood fill isn't guaranteed to find the absolute best path on the first pass, Micromice leverage the need to return to the start for subsequent runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. By treating the return trip as a new journey for searching, the mouse efficiently discovers the shortest path, often leaving irrelevant areas of the maze untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

By the end of the 1980s, with a clear strategy like flood fill and widespread availability of microcontrollers and sensors, some believed the [[micromouse_competition_history_and_rules | Micromouse Contest]] had "outlived itself" as the problem seemed solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Beyond Shortest Path: The Fastest Path
Despite perceptions that the problem was "solved," the competition continued to evolve. In the 2017 All Japan [[micromouse_competition_history_and_rules | Micromouse Competition]], Masakazu Utsunomiya's winning mouse, Red Comet, showcased a paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. While other top mice found and executed the shortest path, Red Comet took a path that was 5.5 meters longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

This was because Micromice are not actually searching for the *shortest* path, but the *fastest* path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Red Comet's search algorithm identified that its longer path had fewer turns, which allowed it to maintain higher speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This strategy won by 131 milliseconds, demonstrating that the ideal path considers both distance and the robot's physical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This highlighted that Micromouse is a robotics problem integrating both software and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

## Innovations in Pathfinding and Movement
Further [[technological_innovations_in_micromouse_design | technological innovations in Micromouse design]] dramatically altered pathfinding strategies:

*   **Diagonal Movement**: An early "Fosbury flop" innovation, the mouse Mitee 3, introduced diagonal movement in the maze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. This was a conceptual breakthrough that required smaller chassis designs (less than 11 cm wide) and entirely new algorithms for sensors and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Unlike maintaining equal distance between parallel walls, diagonals required a different guiding algorithm as walls appear to "come at" the mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Despite increased risk of crashes, diagonals transform jagged paths into single straightaways, significantly improving speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
*   **Fluid Turns**: Around the same time, mice started using similar strategies for turning, performing single U-turn motions instead of stopping and pivoting through multiple turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The addition of diagonals exponentially increased the number of possible turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, making path optimization more complex but allowing for a single, fluid, snaking motion through the maze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

## Continued Algorithmic and Hardware Integration
The evolution of maze-solving algorithms is intrinsically linked with [[technological_innovations_in_micromouse_design | technological innovations in Micromouse design]]. The introduction of smaller infrared sensors, continuous DC motors with encoders, and gyroscopes (often from mobile phone technology) significantly improved the mice's ability to navigate and orient themselves precisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

A later "Fosbury flop" was the integration of a vacuum fan, initially used by Mokomo08 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. While not for flight, the fan vacuums the mouse to the ground, increasing friction and preventing slipping during high-speed turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. This simple addition, often built from handheld drone parts, can generate a downward force five times the mouse's weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, allowing turns with centripetal acceleration approaching six Gs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. This [[technological_innovations_in_micromouse_design | hardware innovation]] directly enabled algorithms to push speed limits, as the added control allowed for more aggressive path execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

The ongoing development in Micromouse, with experiments in six- and eight-wheel designs, omnidirectional movement, and even computer vision, suggests that further paradigm shifts in maze-solving algorithms are yet to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. The sport continues to be a testbed for the interplay between software and hardware in robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

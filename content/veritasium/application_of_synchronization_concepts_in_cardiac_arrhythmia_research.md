The regular beating of the human heart is an example of [[synchronization_phenomena_in_nature_and_technology | spontaneous order]] in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, a lack of synchronization in the heart can lead to serious problems like cardiac arrhythmias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

### Chemical Oscillations as an Analog
In the 1950s, Russian chemists sought a chemical reaction that would oscillate, similar to a pendulum, perhaps changing colors back and forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Naively, this might seem impossible due to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that closed systems tend to increase their entropy and reach equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. However, there's no principle preventing a system from oscillating and damping out to equilibrium in an oscillatory way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Boris Belousov and later Anatol Zhabotinsky discovered such a reaction, known as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This reaction can continue for half an hour or more, oscillating between colors, like a "chemical clock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. When stirred, it provides a sense of quadrillions of molecules all doing the same thing at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

Even more strikingly, if the BZ reaction is not stirred (e.g., in a petri dish), it exhibits spiral waves of color or expanding circles of color moving through the liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The liquid itself is not moving; rather, these are chemical waves where chemical concentrations are changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. These blue waves propagate at a constant speed or grow and spin like spirals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Art Winfrey's Contributions
This phenomenon is "spooky and uncanny" because the same spiral waves of electrical excitation are observed in the heart, looking "exactly like" the chemical waves in the BZ reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This similarity inspired scientist Art Winfrey, who used chemical reaction waves to gain insight into cardiac arrhythmias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

Winfrey's work, observing rotating spirals in both hearts and chemistry, led him to develop a theory about the causes of ventricular fibrillation, the most deadly kind of arrhythmia, which can kill within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This understanding could potentially lead to the design of gentler and more effective defibrillators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. The lack of synchronization in a fibrillating heart prevents blood from being pumped, resulting in sudden death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. This illustrates how too little synchronization is a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

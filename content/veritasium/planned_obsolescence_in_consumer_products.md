Planned obsolescence is a tactic employed by companies to intentionally shorten the lifespan of their products, encouraging consumers to buy replacements sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This strategy, despite seeming counterintuitive for consumer satisfaction, has a long history and continues to impact various industries, from light bulbs and phones to cars and clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Phoebus Cartel: A Conspiracy of Light

The concept of intentionally making products worse emerged as a widespread practice with the [[history_of_the_phoebus_cartel_and_its_impact_on_light_bulb_longevity | Phoebus Cartel]] in the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### The Livermore Centennial Light Bulb

An anomaly that highlights the historical capacity for product longevity is the light bulb at Livermore Fire Station number six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This bulb, manufactured by hand around 1901, has been continuously on for 120 years, running for over a million hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It functions at a low power of four or five watts, serving as a nightlight, and its continuous operation reduces thermal stress from cycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This longevity is notably longer than any light bulb designed today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, and it predates the era of the cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

### Early Light Bulb Technology

Inventing a viable electric light was challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Incandescent designs involve passing electric current through a material, making it glow, but less than 5% of electrical energy converts to light, with the rest released as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Filaments can reach temperatures up to 2,800 Kelvin, half as hot as the sun's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. To prevent melting or burning, Warren De la Rue conceived of putting the filament in a vacuum bulb in the 1840s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Thomas Edison's 1879 bulb, with a cotton thread filament, lasted 14 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Over time, bulb lifespans increased with the use of platinum and carbonized materials, and later, tungsten filaments with high melting points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. By the early 1920s, average bulb lifetimes were approaching 2,000 hours, with some reaching 2,500 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This period, however, marked the peak of longevity, as lifespans then began to shorten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Formation and Goals of the Cartel

In December 1924, major light bulb companies like Phillips, International General Electric, Tokyo Electric, OSRAM, and Associated Electric secretly met in Geneva, Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They formed the [[history_of_the_phoebus_cartel_and_its_impact_on_light_bulb_longevity | Phoebus Cartel]], named after the Greek God of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The cartel aimed to control the world supply of light bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

The biggest threat they faced was from long-lasting bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. For example, OSRAM's sales dropped from 63 million bulbs in 1923 to 28 million in 1924 because bulbs were lasting too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. To counter this, the cartel members agreed to reduce bulb lifespans to 1,000 hours, nearly halving the existing average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Enforcement and Impact

To ensure compliance with the 1,000-hour limit, manufacturers had to submit sample bulbs for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Companies were fined if their bulbs lasted significantly longer than 1,000 hours, with a fine of 200 Swiss Francs per 1,000 bulbs for those lasting over 3,000 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Engineers who previously worked to extend bulb life were then tasked with decreasing it, experimenting with different materials, filament shapes, and thinner connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Their efforts were successful: the lifespan of light bulbs steadily decreased after the cartel's formation, with the average lifespan reaching just 1,205 hours by 1934 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. As planned, sales for cartel members increased by 25% in the four years after 1926, and profits rose as prices remained unchanged despite falling component costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The [[history_of_the_phoebus_cartel_and_its_impact_on_light_bulb_longevity | Phoebus Cartel]] publicly claimed its purpose was to increase standardization and efficiency, successfully establishing the screw thread as a universal standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, evidence points to profit and sales as the primary motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Cartel's Demise

The [[history_of_the_phoebus_cartel_and_its_impact_on_light_bulb_longevity | Phoebus Cartel]], initially planned to last until 1955, collapsed in the 1930s due to external competition, non-compliance among members, and ultimately, the outbreak of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Despite its end, its methods of planned obsolescence persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Modern Examples of Planned Obsolescence

The practice of intentionally shortening product lifespans continues in modern consumer products.

### Apple Products

Apple has faced accusations of planned obsolescence for its products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] iPod Battery Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
> In 2003, a viral video by Casey Neistat highlighted an issue with iPod batteries that died after 18 months. Apple's support suggested that replacing the battery would cost $255 plus a mailing fee, making a new iPod a more cost-effective option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This led to a class-action lawsuit that Apple settled out of court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

In 2017, an iOS update caused older iPhones to slow down significantly or shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Apple stated this throttling was to protect the battery and increase longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Critics argued this wouldn't be an issue if batteries were user-replaceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Subsequent lawsuits resulted in Apple paying hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and settlements by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. However, this amount likely pales in comparison to the extra revenue generated by limiting product lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Nylon Stockings

In the 1940s, nylon replaced silk in stockings, becoming an overnight sensation due to its durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. When manufacturers realized the product was too good, they instructed engineers to weaken the fiber and shorten its lifespan, mimicking the Phoebus Cartel's approach, to boost sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

## The "Benefit" Argument for Obsolescence

Some argue that planned obsolescence can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, real estate broker Bernard London proposed mandatory planned obsolescence to combat widespread unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] Bernard London's Proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>
> "I would have the government assign a lease of life to shoes, and homes, and machines when they are first created and they would be sold and used within the term of their existence, definitely known by the consumer. After the allotted time had expired, these things would be legally dead and would be controlled by the duly appointed governmental agency and destroyed if there is widespread unemployment."

This idea, seemingly radical, reflected a fear that technological progress and overly durable products could lead to job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This concern was even explored in the 1951 Oscar-nominated film "The Man in the White Suit," where a scientist invents a perfect, indestructible fiber, leading factory owners and workers to fear job losses and conspire against him and his invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## [[the_right_to_repair_movement | The Right to Repair Movement]]

Consumers are increasingly pushing back against planned obsolescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Proposed legislation in the European Union and over 25 U.S. states aims to establish the [[the_right_to_repair_movement | right to repair]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. These laws would require manufacturers to provide information and access to parts, making it easier for consumers to repair their products, replace batteries, or fix screens at third-party shops without voiding warranties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Beyond Product Lifespan: [[dynamic_obsolescence_in_the_automotive_industry | Dynamic Obsolescence]]

Even if the [[the_right_to_repair_movement | right to repair]] becomes law, manufacturers have another strategy to encourage new purchases: [[dynamic_obsolescence_in_the_automotive_industry | dynamic obsolescence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. This concept focuses on making existing products feel outdated through style and design changes, rather than physical wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### Henry Ford's Vision

Henry Ford initially envisioned the Model T, released in 1908, as a durable, affordable tool that wouldn't wear out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. He stated, "We want the man who buys one of our cars never to have to buy another, we never make an improvement that renders any previous model obsolete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### General Motors and Harley Earl

By 1920, with 55% of American families already owning a car, the market for new car sales was shrinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. In 1921, DuPont, a chemical and paint company, took over General Motors and began experimenting with different car colors, departing from Ford's "any color so long as it's black" philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

In 1924, GM released its first cars in various colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Soon after, they introduced the annual model change, offering new colors and styles each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. The goal was to make both Ford's Model T and GM's own previous models feel outdated, encouraging customers to frequently trade in their cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

Harley Earl, GM's head of design, candidly discussed his role in creating [[dynamic_obsolescence_in_the_automotive_industry | dynamic obsolescence]]:

> [!QUOTE] Harley Earl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>
> "Our big job is to hasten obsolescence. In 1934, the average car ownership span was five years. Now, which was 1955, it is two years. When it is one year, we will have a perfect score."

By 1955, General Motors was the world's most valuable company, selling half of all vehicles purchased in the US annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Apple's Adoption of Dynamic Obsolescence

Apple, today's most valuable company, appears to have adopted this playbook from the automotive industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This includes introducing new styles and special colors annually, often with only marginal technological improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. This strategy, inspired by the fashion industry where true innovation is difficult, relies on creating new styles each season to drive purchasing urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

The iPhone's design evolution, with its alternating rounded and squared edges, exemplifies this cyclical trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. The constant design changes serve to remind consumers that they don't possess the latest model, compelling them to continuously buy new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## The Future: Technological Obsolescence

The only type of obsolescence that should be supported is technological obsolescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. This refers to products becoming obsolete due to genuine technological advancement rather than intentional design flaws or artificial styling.

### [[transition_from_incandescent_to_led_lighting_technology | LED Lighting]]

In the last two decades, light bulbs have undergone a significant technological evolution, moving from incandescent (which remained largely unchanged for a century) to compact fluorescent, and now to [[transition_from_incandescent_to_led_lighting_technology | LED lighting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. LEDs use about a tenth of the energy and can last 10 to 50 times longer than previous technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. This means a homeowner is more likely to sell their house than need to replace an installed LED bulb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, effectively reaching the point of an "everlasting light bulb" through genuine technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

Planned obsolescence is a strategy where products are intentionally designed or marketed to have a limited lifespan, encouraging consumers to purchase replacements sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This tactic affects various consumer goods, including cars, phones, and light bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Phoebus Cartel and the Light Bulb Conspiracy

The concept of intentionally shortening product life has historical roots. The longest continuously burning light bulb in the world is located at Livermore Fire Station, number six, and has been on for 120 years since 1901 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This hand-manufactured bulb, made shortly after commercial light bulbs were invented, has run for over a million hours, far exceeding the intended lifespan of modern bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

A common anecdote suggests that an "everlasting light bulb" was invented years ago but never sold because it makes for a "terrible business model" due to a lack of repeat customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. While this idea seemed ridiculous, it turns out that products were indeed intentionally made worse in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Evolution of Incandescent Light Bulbs
Inventing a viable electric light was challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The typical incandescent design involves passing electric current through a material to make it glow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Less than 5% of electrical energy in these bulbs is converted to light, with 95% released as heat, making them primarily heat bulbs with light as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Filament temperatures can reach 2,800 Kelvin, half as hot as the sun's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

To prevent melting or burning, Warren De la Rue conceived putting the filament in a vacuum bulb in the 1840s to remove oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. By 1879, Thomas Edison developed a bulb with a cotton thread filament that lasted 14 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Over time, filaments evolved from carbon to tungsten (due to its high melting point), and average bulb lifetimes approached 2,000 hours by the early 1920s, with some lasting 2,500 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### The Formation and Purpose of the Phoebus Cartel
In December 1924, top executives from leading light bulb companies like Phillips, International General Electric, Tokyo Electric, OSRAM, and Associated Electric met in Geneva, Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. They formed the Phoebus Cartel, named after the Greek God of light, to control the world's supply of light bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The biggest threat to these consolidated corporations was the increasing longevity of light bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For example, OSRAM's sales dropped significantly from 63 million bulbs in 1923 to 28 million in 1924 because bulbs were lasting too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Cartel Enforcement and Impact
The cartel members agreed to reduce the lifespan of their bulbs to 1,000 hours, almost halving the existing average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. To enforce this, manufacturers sent sample bulbs for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Companies were fined if their bulbs lasted significantly longer than 1,000 hours; a bulb lasting over 3,000 hours incurred a fine of 200 Swiss Francs per 1,000 bulbs sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. These fines were actively issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Engineers, previously tasked with extending bulb lifespan, were now instructed to decrease it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. They experimented with different materials, filament shapes, and thinner connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Their efforts were successful: bulb lifespan steadily decreased after the cartel's formation, reaching an average of 1,205 hours by 1934 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. As planned, cartel members saw a 25% increase in sales in the four years after 1926 and increased profit margins by keeping prices stable despite reduced component costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

The Phoebus Cartel claimed its purpose was standardization and efficiency, establishing the common screw thread standard still used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. However, evidence suggests its motivation was profit and increased sales, not consumer benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

The Livermore light bulb's longevity is partly due to being made before the cartel era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Additionally, its filament always ran at low power (4-5 watts) as a nightlight, and its continuous operation reduced thermal cycling and stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

The Phoebus Cartel was intended to last until 1955 but collapsed in the 1930s due to external competition, non-compliance among members, and ultimately, World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Despite its demise, its methods for intentionally shortening product lifespans survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Modern [[technological_obsolescence_and_innovation | Planned Obsolescence]]

The tactics of the Phoebus Cartel live on in modern business practices, now widely known as [[technological_obsolescence_and_innovation | planned obsolescence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Apple and Device Longevity
In 2003, Casey Neistat's viral video highlighted Apple's iPod battery issues, where replacing a dead battery (after 18 months) cost nearly as much as a new device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This led to a class-action lawsuit settled by Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

In 2017, an iOS update caused older iPhones to slow significantly or shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Apple claimed it throttled performance to protect older device batteries and extend longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. However, critics noted this wouldn't be an issue if batteries were replaceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Subsequent lawsuits against Apple resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and settlements, an amount likely dwarfed by the additional revenue generated from limiting product lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Arguments for Planned Obsolescence
Some argue that [[technological_obsolescence_and_innovation | planned obsolescence]] is not merely about corporate greed but can also serve broader economic purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Economic Stimulus
During the Great Depression in the 1930s, real estate broker Bernard London proposed mandatory [[technological_obsolescence_and_innovation | planned obsolescence]] as a solution to widespread unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. He suggested the government assign a "lease of life" to products like shoes, homes, and machines, after which they would be "legally dead" and destroyed, thereby stimulating demand and employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This idea reflected fears that technological progress and overly durable products could lead to job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

### Cultural Reflections
The 1951 Oscar-nominated film "The Man in the White Suit" explores this fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. It depicts a scientist who invents a perfect fiber that won't stain, break, or fray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Initially, there's excitement, but factory owners realize they won't sell as much of this durable thread, and workers worry about losing their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The film culminates in factory workers and owners teaming up to destroy the scientist and his invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

This movie may have been inspired by real events with nylon stockings in the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Nylon replaced silk and was so durable that it caused riots when women sought them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. When manufacturers realized the product was "too good," they instructed engineers to weaken the fiber to shorten its lifespan and boost sales, mirroring the Phoebus Cartel's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## The Fight Against [[technological_obsolescence_and_innovation | Planned Obsolescence]]: The [[right_to_repair_movement | Right to Repair]]
Consumers are increasingly pushing back against [[technological_obsolescence_and_innovation | planned obsolescence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Proposed legislation in the European Union and over 25 US states aims to establish the [[right_to_repair_movement | right to repair]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. These laws would compel manufacturers to facilitate product repair by providing information and access to parts, allowing consumers or third-party shops to replace components like batteries or screens without voiding warranties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## "Dynamic Obsolescence" and Consumer Desire

Even with the [[right_to_repair_movement | right to repair]] becoming law, artificial obsolescence may persist through "dynamic obsolescence" driven by consumer desire for newness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Automotive Industry Example
Henry Ford's initial vision for the Model T in 1908 was of a durable, affordable tool that wouldn't wear out, much like the "everlasting light bulb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Ford stated in 1922, "We want the man who buys one of our cars never to have to buy another, we never make an improvement that renders any previous model obsolete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

However, by 1920, 55% of American families owned a car, indicating market saturation among those who could afford one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Following an economic downturn in 1920, DuPont acquired a controlling share in General Motors in 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. DuPont began experimenting with different car colors, a departure from Ford's "any color you like so long as it's black" policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. In 1924, GM released its first multi-colored cars and soon introduced annual model changes with new colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The goal was to make Ford's Model T, and even GM's own previous models, appear outdated, encouraging customers to purchase new ones annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Harley Earl, GM's head of design, explicitly discussed his role in creating "dynamic obsolescence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. He aimed to hasten obsolescence, noting that average car ownership span decreased from five years in 1934 to two years by 1955, with a goal of one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. GM became the world's most valuable company and sold half of all vehicles in the US annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Modern Application: Apple and Fashion
Today, Apple appears to have adopted this strategy, releasing new styles and special colors annually with marginal technological improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. This approach draws inspiration from the fashion industry, where true innovation is difficult, and the only way to drive sales is to create styles that last only a single season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. When styles are exhausted, previous decades' styles are recycled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

The iPhone's design evolution, with its alternating rounded and squared edges, exemplifies this cyclical trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. With design and styling, there is "no best, there's only different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This perceived "difference" is often enough to create a sense of not having the "latest and greatest," driving continuous consumer purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

## Supporting [[technological_obsolescence_and_innovation | Technological Obsolescence]]
The only type of obsolescence that should be supported is genuine [[technological_obsolescence_and_innovation | technological obsolescence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. In the last 20 years, light bulbs have progressed from incandescent (unchanged for 100 years) to compact fluorescent (CFL) and now to LED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. LEDs use only a tenth of the energy and can last 10 to 50 times longer than incandescent bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This innovation has brought about what is essentially an "everlasting light bulb" through genuine technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

The process of discovering truth often involves not just confirming what we believe, but actively trying to disprove it. This concept is illustrated through a number sequence puzzle and the [[the_scientific_method_and_theory_falsification | scientific method]].

## The Number Sequence Puzzle

Participants are given an initial sequence of three numbers, 2, 4, 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, and must deduce the hidden rule by proposing their own three-number sequences. The host provides "yes" or "no" feedback based on whether the proposed sequence follows the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

Initially, participants often propose sequences that fit a perceived rule, such as "multiply by 2" (e.g., 16, 32, 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>; 3, 6, 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>; 10, 20, 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>; 5, 10, 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>; 100, 200, 400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>; 500, 1000, 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>). All these sequences correctly followed the host's rule, even though "multiply by 2" was not the rule itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This approach, though common, was noted as hindering the discovery of the actual rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Shifting Strategy

The key to solving the puzzle lies in trying to *disprove* one's own hypothesis rather than constantly confirming it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. For example, proposing a sequence like 2, 4, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> still fit the actual rule, but it began to challenge the "multiply by 2" assumption. The breakthrough came when a sequence like 10, 9, 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> was proposed and explicitly stated by the host as *not* following the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This immediately led to the correct hypothesis: the numbers must be in ascending order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, which is indeed the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Any numbers in ascending order—like 1, 2, 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> or 7, 8, 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> or 1, 7, 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>—follow the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## The Black Swan Metaphor

This puzzle is inspired by Nassim Taleb's book *The Black Swan* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, which uses the black swan as a metaphor for the unknown and unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Historically, the theory held that all swans were white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Every observation of a white swan seemed to confirm this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. However, one cannot definitively prove a theory true, as evidenced by the discovery of black swans in Australia, which disproved the universal "white swan" theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Disproving Theories for Truth

The tendency to seek confirmation for existing beliefs is a common human trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. However, true understanding and the discovery of truth come from seeking instances that *disprove* a theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. A "no" answer, or a disconfirming piece of evidence, provides far more information than a "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

This principle is fundamental to the [[the_scientific_method_and_theory_falsification | scientific method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Scientists aim to [[the_scientific_method_and_theory_falsification | disprove their theories]], and it is only when they *cannot* disprove them that the theories are considered to reflect something genuinely true about [[perception_of_reality_and_philosophical_implications | reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This approach of actively trying to disprove what one believes to be true is crucial for avoiding self-deception and truly getting at the truth in all aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

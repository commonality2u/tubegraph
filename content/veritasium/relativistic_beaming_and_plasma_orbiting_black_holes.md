The first-ever image of a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]], released by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration on April 10th, 2019, showcases plasma orbiting the supermassive [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] at the center of the galaxy M87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Plasma Orbiting M87

The image reveals plasma orbiting the supermassive [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] at the center of the galaxy M87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Scientists have determined that this plasma orbits clockwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, completing one full orbit in approximately two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

The observation was made using [[use_of_electromagnetic_waves_to_view_black_holes | electromagnetic waves]] with a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters, specifically radio waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This part of the spectrum was chosen because it allows for the visualization of features close to the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] and can penetrate the accretion disk and interstellar dust to reach telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

The M87 supermassive [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] is highly active, continuously consuming large amounts of matter from its glowing hot accretion disk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Relativistic Beaming

A key phenomenon observed in the image is **relativistic beaming** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This effect causes plasma traveling near the speed of light to appear brighter when moving towards the observer and dimmer when moving away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This explains why the bright region of the plasma in the image is intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Jets from M87

In addition to the orbiting plasma, the M87 [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] produces narrow, collimated jets above and below it, which are thought to be generated by incredibly strong magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These jets extend for at least 5,000 light-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

One of these jets appears to be pointing almost directly towards Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Relativistic beaming is again responsible for why this jet is visible in images from the Hubble Space Telescope, while the receding jet is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## How Light Behaves Around Black Holes

The warping of space-time around a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] allows observers to see [[how_light_behaves_around_black_holes | light]] even from parts of the accretion disk that are located behind the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This [[how_light_behaves_around_black_holes | light]] is "lensed" and appears above and below the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | shadow]] region of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Confirmation of Black Holes and General Relativity

The striking image of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] in M87 conclusively confirms the existence of [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. It also provides spectacular support for the [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | general theory of relativity]], published over a hundred years prior, especially in the strongest gravitational fields and at the limits of our ability to test the theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

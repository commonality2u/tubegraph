## The Dzhanibekov Effect and Earth's Stability

In 1985, cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov observed a strange phenomenon while unpacking supplies on the Soviet space station Salyut 7: a wing-nut, spinning off a bolt, maintained its orientation for a short time before flipping 180 degrees, and then continued to flip back and forth at regular intervals without any applied forces or torques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This phenomenon, known as the Dzhanibekov effect, is also called the tennis racket theorem or the intermediate axis theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

After observing the wing-nut's behavior, Dzhanibekov attached a ball of modeling clay to it and found that it also flipped over periodically when spun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. This led to speculation that the Earth, being a spinning ball in space, could also potentially flip over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. Questions arose about whether this phenomenon could be related to the past reversals of Earth's [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic poles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

During the 2012 Mayan prophecies, speculation about the Dzhanibekov effect became irresistible for some conspiracy theorists and media outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. On May 13, 2012, RusCosmos, the official site of the Russian federal space agency, published an article honoring Dzhanibekov's 70th birthday, stating that the spinning nut "caused astonishment and simultaneous danger to a certain part of the scientific world" and that "a hypothesis was proposed that our planet, in the course of its orbital motion, can execute the same overturn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

### The Earth's Stability

The question of whether the Earth will actually flip over can be addressed by understanding the principles of kinetic energy dissipation in spinning bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

For an isolated object spinning in space:
*   Its angular momentum remains constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.
*   However, its [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.

Experiments conducted by astronaut Don Pettit aboard the space station demonstrated that while a solid cylinder will spin stably about its first or third axis (smallest and largest moments of inertia, respectively), a liquid-filled cylinder spinning about its first axis (smallest moment of inertia) becomes unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. This instability occurs because the sloshing liquid dissipates energy, causing the cylinder to eventually rotate about the axis that achieves the minimum kinetic energy, which corresponds to the largest moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.

Therefore, for a given amount of angular momentum, rotating with the maximum moment of inertia represents the lowest energy state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>. Any body capable of dissipating energy internally will tend towards this stable, lowest-energy state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

The Earth, like the liquid-filled cylinder, has internal mechanisms for dissipating energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. Over time, it has evolved to spin about the axis with its maximum moment of inertia, which is a stable configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

### Other Astronomical Objects

This principle applies to most astronomical objects as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>:
*   **Mars** has a large mass concentration called the Tharsis Rise, located at its equator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. This positioning places the mass as far as possible from the axis of rotation, ensuring Mars rotates with its maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.
*   Most [[impact_of_asteroids_on_earth | asteroids]], far from rotating about random axes, also spin almost exclusively around the axis with their maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

Because the Earth is already spinning about its axis of maximum moment of inertia, it is stable and will not flip over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.

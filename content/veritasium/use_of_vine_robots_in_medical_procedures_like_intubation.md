Vine robots, characterized by their ability to grow from the tip using compressed air, are being developed for medical applications, specifically intubation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Researchers are aiming to make intubation faster and safer by using a miniature version of these robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Traditional Intubation vs. Vine Robot Intubation

Intubation is a critical procedure where a tube is inserted into a patient to help them breathe when they are unable to do so on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

Traditionally, a highly trained medical professional uses a laryngoscope to visualize the trachea and then pass a tube down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This method can be time-consuming and involve "wrenching" on the patient, which is problematic when "every second counts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

In contrast, the miniature vine robot could be inserted simply towards the nose by someone with no training, and intubation can be achieved quickly with just a "little bit of pressurization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## Design and "Passive Intelligence"

The vine robot's [[soft_robots_and_their_unique_properties | soft robotics]] design makes it compliant, allowing it to squish and bend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The design incorporates a main robot that grows down into the esophagus, with a side branch that is flexible and heads towards the trachea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This allows the robot to "find its path" and the correct opening, even if the exact shape of the internal anatomy is unknown beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This characteristic is referred to as "passive intelligence" or "mechanical intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Testing and Future Outlook

While not yet tested on live humans, the miniature vine robot has been successfully used to intubate patients in a cadaver lab, demonstrating its effectiveness in an "in-vivo situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

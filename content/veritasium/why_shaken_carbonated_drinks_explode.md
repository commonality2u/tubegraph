It is a common phenomenon that shaking a carbonated drink can cause it to explode upon opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, the reason for this is often misunderstood.

## The Role of Pressure (and what it isn't)

A common misconception, even published in *New Scientist* in 1986, is that shaking a carbonated bottle increases the internal pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

When a carbonated drink has been sitting stationary at room temperature for some time, the dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in the liquid reaches an equilibrium with the CO2 gas in the headspace (the space above the liquid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This equilibrium depends only on the temperature and the pressure of the gas in the headspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. For most soda bottles, this pressure is about 3 atmospheres (330 kilopascals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

No amount of shaking will change this equilibrium pressure in a closed bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. When a bottle at equilibrium is shaken, the pressure reading remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## The Real Reason: Nucleation Sites

The true cause of the "explosion" lies in the introduction of "nucleation sites" into the liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

Under normal conditions, it is difficult for dissolved CO2 gas to spontaneously come out of solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. However, the presence of tiny gas bubbles acts as nucleation sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### How Shaking Works
When a carbonated bottle is shaken, tiny air bubbles are introduced into the liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. These bubbles act as nucleation sites, making it significantly easier for the dissolved CO2 to come out of solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

When the bottle is opened:
1.  The external pressure drops from 3 atmospheres to 1 atmosphere (ambient pressure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
2.  The liquid is no longer in equilibrium, meaning there is more dissolved CO2 than the new pressure allows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
3.  The tiny air bubbles (nucleation sites) introduced by shaking facilitate the rapid release of CO2 from the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
4.  These bubbles expand due to the decrease in pressure, pushing up the liquid above them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
5.  Simultaneously, they act as active sites for more dissolved CO2 to rapidly escape, leading to a forceful eruption of liquid and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### Disarming a Shaken Drink
To prevent an explosion from a shaken carbonated beverage, one can flick the walls of the bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This action dislodges the bubbles clinging to the sides of the bottle, allowing for a safe opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Other Examples of Nucleation Sites
*   **Mentos:** The rough surface of a Mentos candy acts as a nucleation site, rapidly releasing CO2 and creating the well-known soda fountain effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Paper Straws:** Preliminary analysis suggests that paper straws create more bubbles in carbonated drinks than plastic straws, possibly due to their rougher surface acting as more nucleation sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This causes the drink to become fizzier as it travels up the straw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

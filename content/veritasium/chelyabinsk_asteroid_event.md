On February 15th, 2013, an asteroid weighing more than the Eiffel Tower impacted Earth's atmosphere over Chelyabinsk, Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The asteroid exploded 30 kilometers above the ground, creating an event brighter than the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Due to its high altitude, the explosion was silent for a full 90 seconds after the blast, which unfortunately worsened the [[impact_of_asteroids_on_earth | devastation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. People who witnessed the bright flash and smoke trail looked out their windows, only for the shockwave to hit moments later, blowing out glass and causing injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Impact and Consequences
The shockwave from the Chelyabinsk event damaged thousands of buildings and injured 1,500 people, many of whom sustained cuts from flying glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The Chelyabinsk meteor was relatively small, estimated to be only about 20 meters (roughly the width of two school buses) in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. For comparison, the asteroid that created the Barringer Crater, while causing an explosive force of 10 megatons of TNT (600 times the Hiroshima bomb), was only 50 meters in size, "not that much bigger than Chelyabinsk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Detection Failure
What made the Chelyabinsk incident particularly noteworthy is that it occurred on the very same day scientists had predicted another asteroid, known as Duende, would make a close fly-by of Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Indeed, 16 hours after the Chelyabinsk impact, Duende passed within 27,000 kilometers of Earth's surface, closer than geosynchronous satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Despite correctly predicting Duende's close approach, scientists completely missed the unrelated asteroid that exploded over Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

This failure highlights a broader challenge in [[nearearth_objects_and_their_detection_difficulties | detecting asteroids]] before they hit Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Since 1988, over 1,200 asteroids larger than a meter have collided with Earth, yet only five were detected before impact, never with more than a day's warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### The Opposition Effect
One reason for the difficulty in detecting asteroids like Chelyabinsk is that they are rough and dark, reflecting only about 15% of the light that hits them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The best chance to spot them is when they are fully illuminated by the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This phenomenon, known as the "opposition effect," means that over 85% of detected [[nearearth_objects_and_their_detection_difficulties | near-Earth asteroids]] have been found in the 45 degrees of sky directly opposite the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Consequently, any asteroid approaching from the direction of the sun is extremely difficult to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This is precisely what happened with Chelyabinsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

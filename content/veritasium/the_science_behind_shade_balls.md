Shade balls are plastic spheres, often deployed on reservoirs, primarily to protect water quality and reduce evaporation [[Purpose of shade balls in reservoirs | 00:00:28]]. They have unique physical properties that impact their behavior, especially when attempting to interact with them, such as swimming.

## Physical Properties and Arrangement

Shade balls are inherently dense because they are half-full of water, making them heavy [[00:01:42], [00:01:45], [00:07:26]]. A bag of 1,200 shade balls weighs 300 kilograms (660 pounds) [[00:01:49]].

When released onto a water surface, the balls naturally arrange themselves into "crystal structures" as they become close-packed [[00:02:47]]. Boundaries between these "grains" of balls are also observed [[00:02:53]].

Despite their purpose to block sunlight, a surprising amount of light still penetrates a layer of shade balls [[00:03:51], [00:03:56]]. This is because even when packed as tightly as possible, spheres only cover approximately 91% of the water surface [[00:04:01]]. Light passing through these gaps and reflecting off the balls creates distinct patterns on the pool's bottom [[00:04:06]].

Another notable property is the significant noise produced when objects move through them. The sound is so loud and close to the head that it makes hearing anything else virtually impossible [[00:04:17], [00:04:23]].

## [[Swimming in shade balls | Swimming Dynamics]]

Experiments in swimming through shade balls reveal specific scientific principles related to drag and fluid dynamics.

### Single Layer Swimming

Swimming in a single layer of shade balls is possible but presents considerable challenges [[00:03:40], [00:06:23]]. Swimmers experience a "rock tumbler" effect, being knocked around by the balls [[00:04:53]]. Specific swim strokes, such as breaststroke, front crawl (freestyle), and butterfly, were attempted [[00:03:36], [00:04:30], [00:05:40], [00:05:50]]. Butterfly stroke, in particular, was found to be more challenging as it required pushing balls not only forward but also down, up, and out of the way [[00:05:50]].

A key scientific observation is the concept of drag. The force that opposes motion when moving through the shade balls (which can be imagined as particles of their own fluid) is proportional to the square of the velocity (VÂ²) [[00:04:57], [00:05:02]]. This relationship holds because the faster a swimmer moves:
*   More balls are encountered per second [[00:05:13]].
*   The balls are moving faster relative to the swimmer, increasing the impact they have when pushed out of the way [[00:05:18], [00:05:22]].
Consequently, swimming in shade balls provides a more intense workout than regular swimming [[00:05:30], [00:05:35]].

### Multi-Layer Swimming

When multiple layers of shade balls are present, swimming becomes significantly more difficult, bordering on impossible for traditional strokes [[00:08:09], [00:08:18], [00:08:31]]. Unlike a single layer where balls can easily move past each other, multiple layers cause the balls to become trapped against one another, effectively acting more like a solid and providing significantly more resistance [[00:08:58], [00:09:02], [00:09:06]].

The buoyancy of shade balls is limited; each ball, when fully submerged, only supports around 300 grams [[00:07:26], [00:07:32]]. To support an average person entirely above the water, more than 260 shade balls would need to be trapped underneath them [[00:07:37]].

### Quicksand-like Behavior

When floating on a multi-layered surface of shade balls without moving, a person can remain suspended, akin to being in a ball pit with water underneath [[00:09:31], [00:09:37], [00:09:53]]. However, if movement begins, the balls gain enough energy to shift, causing the person to sink deeper, resembling a quicksand-like effect [[00:09:48], [00:09:58], [00:10:02]].

> [!CAUTION] Swimming in shade balls is not recommended by manufacturers due to its inherent dangers [[00:01:15], [00:01:19]]. Manufacturers even refuse requests from residential customers to purchase them for such purposes [[00:01:23], [00:01:28]].

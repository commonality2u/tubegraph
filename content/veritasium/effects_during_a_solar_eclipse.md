During a [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | total solar eclipse]], several noticeable effects and phenomena occur as the Moon obscures the Sun. These changes impact the environment, light, and the observer's sensory experience.

## Environmental and Atmospheric Changes

As the eclipse progresses towards totality, various environmental changes become apparent:
*   **Dimming Light** The light begins to noticeably dim approximately 17 minutes before totality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01"></a>.
*   **Temperature Drop and Wind** A cold wind may be felt, and the overall temperature can become cooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12"></a>.
*   **Increasing Darkness** The environment progressively gets darker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12"></a>.
*   **Unusual Ambiance** The experience can feel "creepy" and "weird" as the darkness deepens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47"></a>.
*   **Surreal Lighting** Observers may witness what appears to be sunset and sunrise simultaneously in every direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58"></a>. The overall appearance can feel "so wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16"></a>.

## Visual Phenomena

The partial and total phases of the eclipse present distinct visual phenomena:
*   **Sharper Shadows** When the sun is about 90 percent covered, shadows become much sharper. This is because the light source narrows from a broad area to a thin sliver of the sun, reducing the typical fuzziness of shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37"></a>.
*   **Solar Corona** During totality, the Sun's outer atmosphere, the solar corona, becomes visible, appearing to emanate from the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18"></a>.
*   **Prominences** Bright, red solar prominences can be seen extending from the Sun's limb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18"></a>.
*   **Visible Planets** Bright planets like Venus may become visible directly above the observer during totality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26"></a>.
*   **"Hole in the Sky" Effect** The eclipsed sun can appear like a dark "hole in the sky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10"></a>.
*   **Diamond Ring Effect** As totality ends and the first rays of sunlight reappear, the "diamond ring" effect is observed, often accompanied by [[community_reactions_to_solar_eclipses | loud cheering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18"></a>.

## Observing and Documenting

Observing a [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | total solar eclipse]] requires specific preparations. For the August 21, 2017, eclipse, an observer in [[observing_solar_eclipses_in_oregon | Madras, Oregon]] used a [[photography_techniques_for_eclipses | sky tracker]] to keep the camera aligned with the Sun and [[photography_techniques_for_eclipses | solar filters]] for protection and photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01"></a>. The experience is often described as "unbelievable," "insane," and "unreal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51"></a>.

Sewing machines are an integral part of modern clothing production, with virtually every piece of clothing made by these machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. They perform "tiny mechanical miracles" every second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The invention of the sewing machine required a completely new method of sewing, distinct from traditional hand sewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Hand Sewing vs. Machine Sewing

Traditionally, hand sewing involves passing a needle fully through fabric, requiring the user to release the needle on one side and pick it up on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. A common hand stitch, like the running stitch, involves weaving the needle back and forth through fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This process of repeatedly releasing and picking up the needle is almost impossible for a machine to do efficiently, especially machines from 200 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Therefore, [[innovations_in_sewing_technology | new ways of sewing]] were needed to develop a machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Early Needles

Humans have been sewing for tens of thousands of years, with evidence of a bone needle found in Siberia dating back approximately 50,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These early needles, made of bone, had a sharp end and an eye for the thread, a design that remained largely unchanged for millennia across various ancient cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

A significant [[innovations_in_sewing_technology | innovation]] occurred in 1755 when German inventor [[famous_figures_in_sewing_machine_development | Charles Frederick Wiesenthal]] created a needle sharp on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This allowed the needle to pass back and forth through fabric without flipping, potentially speeding up sewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. An unexpected benefit of Wiesenthal's design, used by all sewing machines today, was moving the eye of the needle next to the sharp tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This design enabled the thread to go below the fabric without being pulled back out, provided a loop could be formed and secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Types of Stitches for Machines

To prevent the thread from pulling out, two primary methods were developed for machine sewing: the chain stitch and the lock stitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### The Chain Stitch

The chain stitch works by forming a loop of thread underneath the fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. As the needle is pulled out, the fabric is moved, and the needle passes through the previously formed loop, creating a link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Repeating this action forms a chain of stitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This was one of the first stitches successfully performed by sewing machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

#### Early Attempts and Challenges
The exact inventor of the first sewing machine is unclear due to many competing claims and simultaneous work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **[[famous_figures_in_sewing_machine_development | Thomas Saint]]** (1790): Drew detailed patent drawings for a sewing machine but likely never built a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **[[famous_figures_in_sewing_machine_development | Joseph Madersperger]]** (1814): Granted a patent in Vienna after a decade of work, but never commercialized his machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **[[famous_figures_in_sewing_machine_development | Barth√©lemy Thimonnier]]** (1830): Built a version that created a chain stitch with a barb needle, patented it, and set up a factory with 80 machines to produce French army uniforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. His factory was ransacked and machines destroyed by a mob of angry tailors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Chain stitch machines became commercially viable a few decades later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **[[famous_figures_in_sewing_machine_development | James Gibbs]]** (1857): Patented a design where a rotating hook grabs the thread loop as the needle lowers and spins around to release the first loop and grab the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Gibbs developed 37 wooden prototypes to perfect the looper shape, which was then used in over 80 sewing machine models for 80 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **[[famous_figures_in_sewing_machine_development | Charles Raymond]]** (1857): Patented a design using a hook to catch a bulge of thread formed as the needle retracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The hook stretches this bulge into a loop, and as the needle descends again, it passes through the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

A key flaw of the simple chain stitch is that if the thread comes loose, the entire stitching can easily unravel due to minimal friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. More complex chain stitches, using more thread, were developed to be more robust, often found in jean hems or used for embroidery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### The Lock Stitch

The lock stitch, considered a "genius" invention, requires two separate spools of thread: a top thread and a bobbin thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The needle passes through the fabric with the top thread, creating a loop. The second spool (bobbin) thread then passes completely through this loop, interlocking the two threads as the needle pulls the top thread back up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

#### Development of the Lock Stitch Machine
*   **[[famous_figures_in_sewing_machine_development | Elias Howe]]** (1846): Patented the lock stitch and famously demonstrated his machine against five seamstresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. His early machine used a curved needle, held fabric vertically, and could only sew in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **[[famous_figures_in_sewing_machine_development | Allen B. Wilson]]** (1850 & 1851): Dramatically improved the lock stitch sewing machine with two patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
    *   **Vibrating Shuttle Lock Stitch Machine (1850)**: This machine uses an oscillating shuttle containing a bobbin of thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. As the shuttle moves forward, it catches the top thread from the needle, forming a loop. The shuttle passes through this loop, intertwining the top and bobbin threads to create a lock stitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The shuttle's movement is synchronized with the needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Millions of Singer Model 27 machines, which used this design, were made in the late 1800s and were known for their robustness, with many still working over a century later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
    *   **Rotating Hook Mechanism (1851)**: This is the basis for most modern sewing machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. As the needle pulls the top thread down and then slightly up, it creates a small bulge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. A rotating hook grabs this bulge, pulling more thread to pass entirely around the bobbin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. The needle then retracts, pulling in the excess thread to form the lock stitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Both vibrating shuttle and rotating hook machines require identical tension on the top and bottom threads for a strong, balanced stitch, ensuring the same amount of thread is used from both spools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

#### Needle Groove and Friction
The process of the top thread repeatedly pulling down and up around the bobbin creates significant friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. To address this, a groove was developed in the sewing needle to reduce friction between the thread and the fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This [[mechanics_of_sewing_machines | innovation]] led to less fraying of thread and fabric, and cleaner stitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Practically all modern sewing machine needles have a groove on one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Advancing the Fabric: Feed Dogs

Early sewing machines required manual movement of the fabric after each stitch, which was slow, inefficient, and resulted in unevenly spaced stitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. [[famous_figures_in_sewing_machine_development | Allen B. Wilson]] also invented the most successful mechanism for advancing fabric: the feed dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

The design involves a small metal piece, the "foot," pressing down on the fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. When the needle is not in the fabric, a grooved metal piece from below pushes up, grabs the fabric, and moves it forward a fraction of an inch to the next stitch position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This [[mechanics_of_sewing_machines | design]] is used in virtually all modern sewing machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

Modified versions exist, such as the universal feed machine used for chain stitch embroidery, where a handle underneath the machine rotates the entire nose and presser foot, allowing fabric advancement in 360 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Historically, factory machines were often powered by a single large generator (steam or coal), making them very loud and causing them to spin continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Unlike modern machines that can be "feathered" to start slow, old machines would immediately go to 10,000 RPM, requiring immense skill from operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

## Commercialization and Societal Impact

The most renowned name in sewing machines is [[famous_figures_in_sewing_machine_development | Isaac Singer]], though he did not invent the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Singer was a shrewd businessman who acquired patents for various parts and built his company by optimizing the production process, inspired by interchangeable parts in firearm manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This allowed his company to reduce the price of sewing machines from $100 to about $10 (approximately $300 in 2023 terms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

This price drop enabled Singer to sell machines to families, not just corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Singer's business was also one of the first globally to offer installment payment plans, allowing buyers to pay over several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Singer became one of the world's largest corporations and the first American multinational company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

### The Impact on Clothing
The [[history_of_sewing_machines | advent of sewing machines]] revolutionized clothing production:
*   **Time Efficiency**: Before machines, sewing a single shirt took over 12 hours; it now takes less than 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Affordability**: In 1900, the average American family spent about 15% of its income on clothing; by 2003, it was less than 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Increased Ownership**: Despite lower costs, people own more clothes, with the worldwide average number of garments owned exceeding 130 in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   **Environmental Concerns**: Annually, 100 billion garments are produced globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. In the US alone, 11.3 million tons of clothing end up in landfills, equating to nearly 35 kilograms per person each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

Despite the environmental impact of fast fashion, the sewing machine itself is considered a brilliant invention, iterated and improved by many, which truly revolutionized the world by inventing a completely new way to sew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

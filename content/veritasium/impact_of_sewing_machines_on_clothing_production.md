From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 
The [[how_sewing_machines_work | sewing machine]] profoundly impacted [[historical_impacts_and_their_consequences | clothing production]] by introducing a completely new method of sewing that allowed for mechanization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Virtually every piece of clothing worn today was made by a [[how_sewing_machines_work | sewing machine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Pre-Machine Sewing
Before the [[how_sewing_machines_work | sewing machine]], hand sewing required passing a needle fully through fabric, releasing it, and then re-grabbing it on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This process was impractical for machine automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Humans have been sewing for tens of thousands of years, with needles dating back to about 50,000 years ago found in Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Early needles, typically made of bone, had a sharp end and an eye for thread, a design that remained largely unchanged for millennia until 1755 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### [[innovations_in_sewing_technology | Innovations in Sewing Technology]] Enabling Production
The development of the [[how_sewing_machines_work | sewing machine]] required three major breakthroughs, starting with a new needle design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

*   **Eye-Pointed Needle**
    In 1755, German inventor Charles Frederick Wiesenthal patented a needle that was sharp on both sides, allowing it to pass back and forth through fabric without being flipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This design also unexpectedly moved the eye of the needle to the sharp tip, a feature used by all [[how_sewing_machines_work | sewing machines]] to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This innovation was crucial for creating a loop of thread that could be secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Chain Stitch**
    The chain stitch, one of the first stitches successfully performed by machines, works by forming a chain of interlocking loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Early pioneers in [[history_of_sewing_machines | sewing machine development]] included Thomas Saint (1790, detailed drawings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, Joseph Madersperger (1814, patent in Vienna) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, and Barth√©lemy Thimonnier (1830, built a machine and factory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Thimonnier's factory, which manufactured uniforms for the French army, was ransacked by angry tailors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Commercially viable chain stitch machines emerged around 1857 with patents from James Gibbs and Charles Raymond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. While easy to pull out if loose, complex chain stitches are still used today, for example, in jeans hems and embroidery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Lock Stitch**
    The lock stitch, introduced by Elias Howe in 1846, uses two separate threads: a top thread from the needle and a bobbin thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. The needle carries the top thread down, forming a loop through which the bobbin thread is passed, interlocking the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Allen B. Wilson dramatically improved the lock stitch [[how_sewing_machines_work | sewing machine]] with two patents in 1850 and 1851 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. His first patent was for the vibrating shuttle lock stitch machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, and his second, in 1851, is the basis for most modern [[how_sewing_machines_work | sewing machines]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This involves a rotating hook that grabs the top thread loop and passes it entirely around the bobbin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Proper tension on both threads is crucial for a strong stitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Feed Dogs**
    Early [[how_sewing_machines_work | sewing machines]] required fabric to be moved by hand after each stitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Allen B. Wilson also invented the "feed dogs," small pieces of metal with grooves that push up from below the fabric when the needle is out, advancing it for the next stitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This design is used in nearly all modern [[how_sewing_machines_work | sewing machines]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

### Commercialization and Impact on Cost
Isaac Singer did not [[historical_figures_in_sewing_machine_development | invent the sewing machine]], but he was a shrewd businessman who bought up patents and optimized the production process, inspired by interchangeable parts in firearm manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. His company dramatically dropped the price of [[how_sewing_machines_work | sewing machines]] from $100 to about $10 (approximately $300 in 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This affordability allowed sales to families, not just corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Singer's business also pioneered installment payment plans, making machines accessible to a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. This led Singer to become one of the largest corporations and the first American multinational company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

### Revolutionizing Clothing Production
The [[how_sewing_machines_work | sewing machine]] led to immense efficiencies:
*   **Time Savings** Before machines, sewing a single shirt took over 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. With a [[how_sewing_machines_work | sewing machine]], it takes less than 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **Consumer Spending** In 1900, the average American family spent about 15% of its income on clothing; by 2003, this dropped to less than 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Increased Ownership and Production** Despite lower spending, people own more clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. In 2019, the worldwide average was over 130 garments owned per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Annually, 100 billion garments are produced globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

### [[environmental_impact_and_carbon_footprint_of_concrete_production | Environmental Impact]] and Waste
The efficiency of [[how_sewing_machines_work | sewing machines]] has contributed to massive production volumes, leading to significant waste. In the US alone, 11.3 million tons of clothing end up in landfills each year, equating to nearly 35 kilograms per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

The [[how_sewing_machines_work | sewing machine]] is a brilliant invention, developed, iterated upon, and improved by many individuals, truly revolutionizing the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

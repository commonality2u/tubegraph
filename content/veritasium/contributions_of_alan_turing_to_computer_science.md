Alan Turing, a pivotal figure in mathematics, made foundational contributions to computer science, originating concepts that led directly to modern computational devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

## Inventing the Modern Computer

In 1936, Alan Turing devised a theoretical model of computation, effectively inventing the modern computer, to address David Hilbert's question about the decidability of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. At the time, "computers" referred to people performing tedious calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. Turing's vision was an entirely mechanical computer, designed to be powerful enough for any imaginable computation yet simple enough for its operations to be reasoned through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

## The Turing Machine

Turing conceived of a machine that operates on an infinitely long tape of square cells, each containing a zero or a one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. This "Turing machine" possesses a read/write head that processes one digit at a time and can perform only a few basic tasks:
*   Overwrite a new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>
*   Move left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>
*   Move right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>
*   Halt (indicating program completion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>

The machine's program consists of a set of internal instructions, akin to a flowchart, dictating its actions based on the read digit and its internal state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. This program could be transferred to any other Turing machine, which would then behave identically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

Despite its apparent simplicity, a Turing machine, with its arbitrarily large memory and program, can execute any computable algorithm given sufficient time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. This includes fundamental arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction, up to complex modern algorithms like the entire YouTube algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. Essentially, a Turing machine can perform anything a modern computer can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.

### Decidability and the Halting Problem
Turing's machine proved instrumental in answering Hilbert's question about decidability. A key aspect of the Turing machine is whether it will "halt" (finish running) or get stuck in an infinite loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. Turing realized this "halting problem" was analogous to the decidability problem in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

Turing's proof demonstrated that it is impossible to create a universal algorithm that can determine beforehand whether any given Turing machine program will halt on a specific input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. This implies that mathematics is undecidable; no algorithm can consistently determine if a statement can be derived from its axioms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. Consequently, some mathematical problems, such as the Twin Prime Conjecture, might be fundamentally unsolvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.

## Turing Completeness
Turing designed his machines to be the most powerful computational systems possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. This concept is known as [[turing_completeness|Turing completeness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. Many systems are Turing complete, including Wang tiles, complex quantum systems, and even John Conway's Game of Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>. While powerful, every Turing-complete system inherently possesses an undecidable property, an "analog of the halting problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

## Practical Applications and Legacy

Alan Turing's theoretical ideas found immediate practical application during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. He led the team at Bletchley Park that built real calculating machines to crack Nazi codes for the Allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. This intelligence is estimated to have shortened the war by two to four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

After the war, Turing, alongside John von Neumann, designed ENIAC, which became the first true programmable electronic computer based on Turing's foundational designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

Turing is widely recognized as the most important founding figure in computer science, and all modern computers are direct descendants of his designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. His concepts regarding computability, stemming from the philosophical questions about self-reference and decidability in mathematics, directly led to the invention of the computational devices we use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.

The current definition of the kilogram, established in 1889, relies on a physical object known as the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK), or "Le Grand K," a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder stored in a vault near Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:27">[03:46:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:30">[03:51:30]</a>. It is the only base [[history_and_evolution_of_the_kilogram | SI unit]] still defined by a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:54">[04:13:54]</a>. However, the mass of the IPK and its replicas has shown to diverge over time, making it an unstable standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:35">[05:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:04">[06:01:04]</a>, which presents [[issues_with_the_stability_of_physical_mass_standards | a significant problem]] for precise measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:44">[06:08:44]</a>. This instability affects four of the seven base [[history_and_evolution_of_the_kilogram | SI units]] and many derived units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

To eliminate the kilogram's dependence on a physical object, new approaches are being explored to redefine it based on fundamental constants.

## The Silicon Sphere Approach

One prominent approach involves using a precisely sculpted sphere of pure [[redefining_the_kilogram_using_silicon28_atoms | silicon-28 atoms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

### The Object
The sphere is a 1kg mass made of [[redefining_the_kilogram_using_silicon28_atoms | silicon-28 atoms]], containing approximately 2.15 x 10<sup>25</sup> atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. Its raw material alone was worth 1 million Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. This sphere is considered the roundest object in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>; if it were the Earth, the highest mountain to the lowest valley would be only about 14 meters apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>.

### Purpose and Manufacturing
The investment in perfecting such a sphere stems from the need for a stable and universally reproducible standard for mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>. The sphere is made of pure silicon, specifically containing only one isotope, [[redefining_the_kilogram_using_silicon28_atoms | silicon-28]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:02">[07:34:02]</a>. It is engineered as a perfect crystal with no voids or dislocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:05">[07:26:05]</a>.

The manufacturing process begins with an oversized sphere, about two millimeters larger in diameter, which is progressively ground finer using abrasives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:40">[08:02:40]</a>. This process involves controlling the shape of the object at an atomic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:03">[08:16:03]</a>.

### Redefining the Kilogram
The spherical shape is chosen because if its diameter is known, the entire dimension of the object can be characterized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:08">[07:43:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:15">[07:49:15]</a>. The diameter of the sphere is accurately measured using a laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:28">[08:25:28]</a>. By knowing the diameter, its volume can be determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:27">[08:39:27]</a>. Since the atom spacing in silicon is known to high precision, the total number of atoms in the sphere can be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

This process allows for the redefinition of Avogadro's constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:11">[08:49:11]</a>. Currently, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram, representing the number of atoms in twelve grams of Carbon-12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:09">[08:55:09]</a>. Under the silicon sphere approach, the fixed number of [[redefining_the_kilogram_using_silicon28_atoms | silicon atoms]] in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then, in turn, define the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:08">[09:05:08]</a>.

This means that even if the physical silicon spheres were lost or damaged, the definition of the kilogram would remain unaffected because it would be defined by a fundamental concept rather than a physical artifact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:39">[09:10:39]</a>. The desired future definition would be: "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 [[redefining_the_kilogram_using_silicon28_atoms | silicon-28 atoms]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.

## The Watt Balance Approach
Another approach to redefining the kilogram involves fixing Planck's constant, which is done using a device called a Watt Balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:25">[09:39:25]</a>.

## Complementary Efforts and Future Prospects
Both the silicon sphere and Watt Balance approaches are complementary, serving as checks on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. If both methods achieve good agreement and reduce their uncertainties to about 20 micrograms, the kilogram could be redefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. This redefinition would establish the kilogram as an unchanging unit, no longer dependent on a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

Historically, the kilogram was initially intended to be the mass of a liter of water at its densest temperature (4 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:36">[03:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:08">[10:29:08]</a>. The current IPK has a mass of 999.975 grams compared to this original water definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:20">[10:36:20]</a>. The ability of 18th-century scientists to create an artifact within the margin of error of a grain of rice is remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

Antoine Lavoisier, a notable scientist involved in defining the original "grave" (the precursor to the kilogram) in 1793 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>, also conceived of silicon as an element in 1787, thus linking his contributions to both the initial and potentially future definitions of the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:20">[11:20:20]</a>.

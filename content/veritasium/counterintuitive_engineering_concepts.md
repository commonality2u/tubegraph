Certain engineering challenges present [[counterintuitive_logic_puzzles | counterintuitive]] solutions that initially appear to violate fundamental laws of physics, such as the law of conservation of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. One such long-standing brain teaser asks: Can any wind-powered vehicle go directly downwind faster than the wind itself? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>

## The Blackbird Vehicle

The Blackbird is a one-of-a-kind propeller craft designed and built to settle this physics debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its creators claim it can travel straight downwind faster than the wind that is pushing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Initial Intuition vs. Reality

Common intuition suggests that a vehicle like a sailboat, traveling directly downwind, can only match the speed of the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Once the sailboat reaches the same speed as the wind, there is no longer any apparent wind to push the sail, effectively stopping its acceleration relative to the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This means it can never exceed the wind's speed when going straight downwind, even without drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### How Blackbird Works

The Blackbird operates in a [[counterintuitive_logic_puzzles | counterintuitive]] way compared to a traditional sailboat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Instead of the wind blowing the propeller to turn the wheels (like a windmill) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, the vehicle's forward motion, initially from the wind pushing its body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, causes its wheels to turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. These wheels are geared to the propeller, causing it to spin in the *opposite* direction of the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. The propeller thus functions like a fan, pushing air backward to generate thrust, driving the craft forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

Even when the vehicle is moving at the speed of the wind, the propeller can still push air backward, generating thrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. This mechanism allows the vehicle to take kinetic energy from the wind and convert it into the cart's kinetic energy, effectively slowing down the air behind the propeller while accelerating the cart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. This means the Blackbird is indeed able to move faster than the true wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. The Blackbird has achieved speeds up to 2.8 times the wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### Public Reception and Validation

The concept proved so [[counterintuitive_logic_puzzles | counterintuitive]] that its initial theoretical presentation on forums was met with disbelief and accusations of violating physics laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Even after a model successfully demonstrated the principle on a treadmill, many, including physics professors, doubted its validity, believing it was a trick or that the treadmill wasn't a good real-world analog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This persistent skepticism led to the construction of the full-scale Blackbird to definitively prove the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### Sailboats Traveling Faster Than Wind

While sailboats cannot go directly downwind faster than the wind, they *can* travel faster than the wind if they sail at an angle to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. In this scenario, the sail acts like an airfoil, generating lift perpendicular to the apparent wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. A component of this lift force pushes the boat forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Some sailboats can reach speeds three or four times faster than the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

This leads to another [[counterintuitive_logic_puzzles | counterintuitive]] brain teaser: if a sailboat tacks downwind, can its "velocity made good" directly downwind be faster than the wind itself, meaning it could beat a balloon drifting directly downwind to a destination? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a> It turns out the answer is yes; by sailing at an angle, the sailboat's resulting velocity directly downwind can indeed exceed the wind's speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### The Cylindrical Earth Analogy

The [[counterintuitive_logic_puzzles | counterintuitive]] principle of going faster than the wind downwind can be visualized using an analogy of a cylindrical Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. If the wind travels along this cylindrical Earth, a sailboat could continuously tack or spiral its way downwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. If two such sailboats were placed on opposite sides, their sails would collectively form a propeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This propeller, driven by the turning of the "cylindrical Earth," would then travel down the cylinder faster than the wind itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

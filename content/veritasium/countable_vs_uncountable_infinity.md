The Hilbert Hotel is a thought experiment used to illustrate different sizes of [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This hotel has an [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] number of rooms, numbered one, two, three, four, and so on indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While it might seem like the hotel can always accommodate more guests, there is a limit to even its [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Accommodating More Guests

Assuming only one person is allowed per room and all rooms are initially full with an [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] number of guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>:

### A Single New Guest

When one new person arrives and all rooms are occupied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:
*   Instruct every existing guest to move down one room (e.g., room 1 moves to room 2, room 2 to room 3, and so on) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   This frees up room one for the new guest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### A Finite Busload of Guests

If a bus carrying a finite number of people, like 100, arrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>:
*   Move all current guests down by the number of new arrivals (e.g., 100 rooms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   The first 100 rooms become available for the new guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### An Infinite Busload of Guests

When an [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinitely]] long bus carrying [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinitely]] many people arrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>:
*   Tell each existing guest to move to the room with double their current room number (e.g., room 1 to 2, room 2 to 4, room 3 to 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   This leaves all odd-numbered rooms vacant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Since there are an [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] number of odd numbers, each person from the [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] bus can be assigned a unique odd-numbered room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### An Infinite Number of Infinite Buses

If an [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] number of [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] buses arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>:
*   Imagine an [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Create rows for the hotel guests and each bus (Bus 1, Bus 2, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Create columns for each person's position (Hotel Room 1, Bus 1 Seat 1, etc.), giving each person a unique identifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Draw a zigzag line from the top-left corner across the spreadsheet, hitting each unique ID exactly once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   Straighten this line out, effectively mapping an [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]]-by-[[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] grid to a single [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   Each person on this line can then be assigned a unique room in the hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Uncountable Infinity

Despite the ability to accommodate all these [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] groups, there is a limit. Imagine an [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] party bus where guests are identified by [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinitely]] long names consisting only of the letters 'A' and 'B' (e.g., ABB A A A A A A A A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Every possible [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] sequence of 'A's and 'B's represents a unique guest on this bus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

When attempting to assign rooms to these guests using the spreadsheet method, a problem arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>:

*   Even if a complete [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinite]] list of these names is created and matched to rooms, it is still possible to write down the name of a person who is not on that list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   This is done by taking the first letter of the first name on the list and flipping it (A to B, B to A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   Then take the second letter of the second name and flip it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Continue this process down the diagonal of the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   The resulting name will be different from every name on the list by at least one character (the character on the diagonal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Therefore, this person cannot be on the list.

### Countably vs. Uncountably Infinite

*   The number of rooms in the Hilbert Hotel is **countably infinite** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This means there are as many rooms as there are positive integers (1, 2, 3...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   By contrast, the number of people on the "party bus" is **uncountably infinite** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. If you try to match each person with an integer, you will always have people left over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   This demonstrates that some [[infinity_in_mathematics | infinities]] are larger than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

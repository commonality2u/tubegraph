The detection of asteroids, particularly those that pose a threat to Earth, is a complex and ongoing challenge for scientists. Despite advanced technology, many factors make it difficult to identify these celestial bodies before they impact our planet.

### The Chelyabinsk Incident: A Wake-Up Call
On February 15, 2013, an asteroid, heavier than the Eiffel Tower, struck Earth's atmosphere over [[chelyabinsk_asteroid_impact | Chelyabinsk, Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. It exploded 30 kilometers above the ground with a flash brighter than the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. The shockwave, which arrived 90 seconds after the blast, damaged thousands of buildings and injured 1500 people, many from shattered glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

Embarrassingly, on the very same day, scientists had predicted a close fly-by of a similar-sized asteroid named Duende, which indeed came within 27,000 kilometers of Earth 16 hours after Chelyabinsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. However, the Chelyabinsk asteroid was completely missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

Since 1988, over 1200 asteroids larger than a meter have collided with Earth, yet only five were detected before impact, never with more than a day's warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. This highlights the significant challenges in asteroid detection.

### What are Asteroids?
Asteroids are the remnants from the formation of our solar system, 4.5 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. They formed from rocks and dust clumping into molten protoplanets. While some grew into planets, many others collided and broke into smaller fragments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This origin explains why some are rocky "rubble piles," while others, originating from protoplanet cores, are primarily metallic, like iron meteorites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

Most asteroids reside in the stable orbit of the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. However, some have orbits that bring them closer to Earth; these are known as [[potential_threats_from_near_earth_objects | Near Earth Objects]] (NEOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. Stephen Hawking considered an asteroid impact to be the greatest threat to life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

### Challenges in Detection
Detecting asteroids is difficult due to several factors:
*   **Size**: Asteroids range from meters to kilometers in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Even smaller ones can cause significant damage; the Chelyabinsk meteor was only about 20 meters in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. In the vastness of space, these rocks are hard to spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   **Low Reflectivity**: Asteroids are typically rough and dark, reflecting only around 15% of the light that hits them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **Opposition Effect**: The best chance to see asteroids is when they are fully illuminated by the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. This means over 85% of detected near-Earth asteroids are found in the 45 degrees of sky directly opposite the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Consequently, any asteroid approaching from the direction of the sun is extremely difficult to see, as was the case with Chelyabinsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

### Challenges in Orbit Prediction
Even once an asteroid is detected, predicting if it will hit Earth is challenging:
*   **Limited Data**: Initial observations over only a few days are insufficient to accurately predict an asteroid's trajectory far into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Years of observations are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   **Gravitational Influences**: Asteroids are not solely influenced by the sun; the gravity of all planets pull on NEOs, significantly altering their orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
*   **Dynamical Chaos**: This phenomenon means that beyond a certain period, it becomes impossible to know an asteroid's precise location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. In practice, this limits accurate predictions to about 100 years into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

### Current Status and Remaining Threats
To date, a million asteroids have been detected and cataloged, with the majority located in the main asteroid belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. Of these, 24,000 are [[potential_threats_from_near_earth_objects | Near Earth Objects]] (NEOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

While there are no known 10-kilometer asteroids (like the one that caused the K-T extinction event and wiped out dinosaurs) with an Earth-intersecting path for the next 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>, smaller, yet still dangerous, asteroids remain a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. For every 10-kilometer asteroid, there are roughly a thousand 1-kilometer asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.

Scientists believe they have identified 90-98% of 1-to-2-kilometer bodies that could potentially hit Earth, and their orbits allow for reasonable predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. However, the greatest remaining threat comes from asteroids a few hundred meters in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. These are large enough to obliterate a major city, causing city-wide fires and ejecta that would devastate a 100-kilometer zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. Many of these have not yet been detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>, and such an event could happen "tomorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.

### Limited [[strategies_for_asteroid_deflection | Deflection Capabilities]]
Currently, there are no effective ways to deflect a kilometer-sized asteroid, let alone a 10-kilometer one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>. Ideas such as bombing them, attaching rockets for a gentle nudge, or ablating the surface with lasers are not currently feasible due to technological limitations and the nature of asteroids (e.g., re-forming as rubble piles, insufficient rocket power, lack of powerful lasers, difficulty attaching to rotating bodies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. Even the concept of wrapping an asteroid in reflective foil to alter its path is not practical with current [[space_exploration_challenges | launch capabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>.

Given these limitations, the most practical approach is to focus on detection: building more telescopes, including space-based ones, to conduct thorough surveys and understand the threat from asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>. This way, if a particularly dangerous object is identified, efforts can then be focused on developing deflection methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>.

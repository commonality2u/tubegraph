In the summer of 1978, structural engineer Bill LeMessurier made a "terrifying discovery" about the newly opened Citicorp Center in Manhattan: his skyscraper, hailed as an engineering marvel, had a fatal flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Winds of just 110 kilometers per hour could cause the building to collapse, potentially killing thousands in the surrounding area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. LeMessurier faced a stark choice: remain silent or risk professional ruin and mass panic to fix it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. His decision and subsequent actions became a pivotal case study in engineering ethics.

## The Flaw: Design Choices and Overlooked Forces

The Citicorp Center's unique design stemmed from a challenging constraint: the building had to be constructed around Saint Peter's Church, which insisted on remaining independent and having two-thirds of the space above it open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This led LeMessurier to propose supporting the skyscraper on stilts, placed at the center of each face rather than the corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

To manage gravity and wind loads with this unconventional support, LeMessurier designed a system of diagonal chevron braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. By removing columns at the top and middle of each chevron, every eight stories, half of the gravity load would be forced through the chevrons to the mid-face columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This unique system was critical for both gravity and wind loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The building was also designed to be lighter than most other New York buildings, making it swayable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. To address this, LeMessurier incorporated a [[counterintuitive_engineering_concepts | tuned mass damper (TMD)]], a system previously used in bridges and ships but never before in a building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This 400-ton concrete block on the top floor would oscillate out of phase with the building's motion, significantly damping its sway and saving millions in structural steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

The initial hint of trouble emerged in May 1978 when LeMessurier learned that the chevron connections were bolted, not welded, as he had assumed for his original design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. While bolts aren't inherently inferior to welds, this substitution was a surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. A month later, a student called LeMessurier to question the design, specifically the columns not being at the corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. While initially dismissive, the call prompted LeMessurier to double-check his calculations, considering "quartering winds"â€”winds hitting the building's corners instead of straight on its faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

He found that quartering winds increased forces on some diagonals by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This wouldn't have been an issue with the original welded design, but it was critical for the bolted connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. LeMessurier's firm had calculated the number of bolts based on straight-on wind, not diagonal wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Furthermore, they had considered the braces "minor structural elements," leading them to use an insufficient factor of safety by underestimating the gravity load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. For some critical joints, this meant only four bolts were used where 14 were truly needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

Further analysis with Alan Davenport at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel revealed that the stresses could increase up to 60% due to dynamic conditions, not just static ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. LeMessurier determined that the weakest joints were on the 30th floor, and their failure would cause the entire building to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. A storm strong enough to collapse the building occurred, on average, every 67 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. However, if the tuned mass damper lost power, 110 km/h winds for just five minutes could cause collapse, with a one in 16 chance of such a storm in any given year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Hurricane Belle, with 110 km/h gusts, had passed through New York City just a year before Citicorp's completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

## An Ethical Imperative: Project Serene

LeMessurier knew he had to act, despite the looming threat of lawsuits, bankruptcy, and professional ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. He even contemplated suicide, admitting he thought about driving into a bridge abutment to make "all of this would go away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. However, with thousands of lives at stake, he concluded there was "never any other choice but to act" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

He informed Citicorp's chairman, Walter Wriston, and together they launched a confidential repair plan, initially called Project Pandora, then renamed "Project Serene" (Special Engineering Review of Events Nobody Envisioned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. Emergency generators were acquired for the TMD, which became the building's crucial crutch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. Each night, welders entered the building after hours, removed sheetrock, and welded two five-centimeter thick, two-meter long steel plates onto each of the over 200 joints, prioritizing the weakest ones on the 30th floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

Repairs could not be completed before hurricane season, so Citicorp worked with the Red Cross to develop a 10-block evacuation plan for thousands of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. The building's collapse could have led to a catastrophic chain reaction, toppling into other buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. Despite the risks, they chose not to inform the public or office workers to prevent mass panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Strain gauges were installed on structural members, monitored from a command center, providing some warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Citicorp's chairman even secured immediate installation of new telephone lines from AT&T's president for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

### Near Misses and Secrecy

A statement released by Citicorp on August 8th about the repairs contained "white lies" to avoid public terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. A stroke of luck occurred when LeMessurier attempted to call The New York Times, only to discover all New York newspapers had gone on strike until October, creating a "press blackout" that allowed repairs to continue smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.

The most critical moment arrived in late August with Hurricane Ella brewing in the Caribbean, intensifying to 200 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. With repairs only halfway done, city officials prepared for evacuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. After 24 tense hours, Ella veered off into the sea, intensifying further but sparing New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

## Legacy and Impact

The repairs were completed in October, just six weeks after LeMessurier informed Citicorp, making the building capable of withstanding a one-in-1000-year storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. The cost was between $4 and $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

For almost two decades, the secret remained confined to a small inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. In 1995, *The New Yorker* finally brought Project Serene to light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. Far from being vilified, LeMessurier was praised for owning up to his mistake and fixing the issue promptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.

The [[Impact of the Citicorp case on building regulations and architecture | Citicorp case]] had a profound impact:
*   New York updated its building code to require quartering wind calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
*   [[Impact of the Citicorp case on building regulations and architecture | Tuned mass dampers]] spread globally, allowing architects to design taller and slimmer skyscrapers, becoming ubiquitous in places like Japan and critical in typhoon and earthquake-prone regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. Six of the 20 tallest buildings in the world now include TMDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.

## Lingering Questions and Enduring Principles

The identity of the student who prompted LeMessurier's re-evaluation of the design remains a point of [[Scientific debate and public discourse | scientific debate and public discourse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. Princeton student Diane Hartley was initially thought to be the caller based on her senior thesis work on Citicorp, which also questioned quartering winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. However, she never spoke to LeMessurier personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. In 2011, Lee DeCarolis came forward, claiming to be the student from the New Jersey Institute of Technology who spoke with LeMessurier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>. LeMessurier passed away in 2007 before confirming the student's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

Despite these ongoing debates and the reluctance of some involved parties to discuss the incident, LeMessurier's actions are still regarded as exemplary in the engineering field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>. The Citicorp case is taught worldwide as a model of good [[Role of responsibility and knowledge in Earharts journey | engineering ethics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. LeMessurier himself articulated the core principle: "If you see something that is a social risk... you must do something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. His decision demonstrated the immense [[Role of responsibility and knowledge in Earharts journey | emotional pressure and ethical obligation]] engineers face when their work impacts public safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.

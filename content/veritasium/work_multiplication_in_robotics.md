## What is Work Multiplication?
[[Work multiplication in robotics | Work multiplication]] is a design principle that allows an engineered [[jumping_robot_engineering_and_design | jumper]] to store up [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | energy]] from many strokes or revolutions of its motor, unlike an [[comparative_analysis_of_jumping_in_animals_and_robots | animal]] which can only jump using a single stroke of its muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. This allows a small motor to deliver significant [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | energy]] gradually over a few minutes, rather than all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. The trade-off for this increased [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | energy]] output is time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

### Mechanism in Jumping Robots
In a specific [[jumping_robot_engineering_and_design | jumping robot]] designed to achieve record heights, the [[work multiplication in robotics | work multiplication]] mechanism operates as follows:
*   A small motor winds up a string around its axle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
*   This process compresses the robot's structure, which consists of carbon fiber and rubber bands, storing [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | energy]] in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
*   The structure reaches maximum compression after about a minute and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
*   A latch holds the string under tension, preventing the spring from unspooling until the robot is fully compressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
*   Upon release by a trigger, the string unspools all at once, and the stored [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | energy]] is released, launching the robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   This allows the robot to go from a standstill to over 100 kilometers per hour in only nine milliseconds, experiencing an [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | acceleration]] of over 300 g's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

## Comparison to Biological Organisms
While [[comparative_analysis_of_jumping_in_animals_and_robots | biological organisms]] use latches, no organism has developed [[work multiplication in robotics | work multiplication]] for a jump from a standstill internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. [[comparative_analysis_of_jumping_in_animals_and_robots | Animals]] like the sand flea use a "trigger muscle" and a "big power muscle" in a torque reversal mechanism to release stored [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | energy]] for a single powerful stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

However, some [[comparative_analysis_of_jumping_in_animals_and_robots | animals]] exhibit external forms of [[work multiplication in robotics | work multiplication]]:
*   **Spider Monkeys**: Have been observed pulling back a branch hand over hand, using multiple muscle strokes, storing [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | energy]] in the bend of the branch to catapult themselves forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
*   **Slingshot Spider**: Shoots out a silky string which it pulls back multiple times to slingshot itself to another location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

## Impact and Future of Robotics
For years, [[jumping_robot_engineering_and_design | engineered jumping]] was developed to mimic [[comparative_analysis_of_jumping_in_animals_and_robots | biological jumping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. However, with [[work multiplication in robotics | work multiplication]], [[jumping_robot_engineering_and_design | engineered jumpers]] gained a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. The ability to generate a large burst of [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | energy]] by running a motor for an extended period means that the motor's [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | power]] is no longer the limiting factor; the spring becomes the primary focus for optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

This concept could revolutionize robotics by allowing robots to store and release immense amounts of [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>. Currently, motors in robots must be relatively small for portability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. However, the simple principle of building up [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | energy]] from multiple turns of a motor over time allows for huge [[weight_and_torque_dynamics | energy]] storage and release, potentially setting new world records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.

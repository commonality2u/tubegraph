Experiments are designed to test the visual capabilities of jumping spiders, specifically their ability to distinguish between colors. The core theory involves presenting a spider with a screen displaying a moving shape that differs from the background in color but not in brightness, and observing if the spider attempts to follow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This helps researchers understand [[spider_response_to_color_and_brightness | spider response to color and brightness]].

## Experimental Setup

A significant challenge in these experiments is that if jumping spiders are allowed to turn freely, their movement changes what they see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. To maintain control over what the spiders can see at any given moment, [[experimental_methods_in_spider_research | researchers]] employ a specific setup:

*   **Immobilization**: Spiders are held in place with tiny magnets attached to their heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This technique is an example of the [[use_of_magnets_for_controlling_spider_movement | use of magnets for controlling spider movement]] in biological studies.
*   **Movement Tracking**: The spiders stand on a ball, holding it with their feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Researchers monitor how this ball moves beneath their feet to determine where the spider intends to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This method allows for the [[behavioral_analysis_of_spiders_with_soccer_balls | behavioral analysis of spiders with soccer balls]] (or similar spherical objects).

## Interpreting Spider Response

If a spider turns the ball to the left, it indicates that it is likely attempting to look to the right to follow the moving shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Such a response serves as evidence that the spider possesses the ability to discriminate between the colors of the shape and its background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, further clarifying aspects of [[spider_response_to_color_and_brightness | spider response to color and brightness]].

The experience of extreme silence, particularly within specialized environments like [[anechoic_chambers_and_their_effects | anechoic chambers]], can elicit a range of [[Psychological responses to silence | psychological responses]] and [[sensory_perceptions_in_soundproof_environments | sensory perceptions]]. Anechoic chambers, designed to eliminate echoes, are often described as the [[experiences_in_the_quietest_place_on_earth | quietest places on Earth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Anechoic Chamber Environment
An anechoic chamber, a term derived from Latin meaning "no echo," achieves its unique acoustic properties through the extensive use of foam wedges on walls and floors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These wedges absorb sound: low-frequency sounds bounce within the shapes until they dissipate, while high frequencies are absorbed directly into the foam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The floor is often a spring floor, with wedges underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This design totally changes the quality of sound, as demonstrated by the deadening of claps when the doors are closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Reported Psychological Effects
Reports suggest it's "impossible" for individuals to remain sane in these rooms for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The record for staying inside is reportedly 45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Commonly reported [[Psychological responses to silence | psychological reactions]] include:
*   **Claustrophobia and pressure** The lack of reverb, which normally signals "space" to the ear, can make the room feel tiny and confining, like a coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Anxiety and panic** Individuals are accustomed to surrounding sounds, and their absence can induce panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This anxiety can escalate into stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Disorientation and physical discomfort** Some people report becoming disoriented, dizzy, and nauseous to the point of being unable to stand up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Auditory [[sensory_perceptions_in_soundproof_environments | hallucinations]]** It is suggested that the brain may try to "make up for what they are used to that isnâ€™t there" by creating sounds or [[sensory_perceptions_in_soundproof_environments | hallucinations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. A violinist reportedly banged on the door to get out within seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Amplified Internal Sensations
In the absence of external noise, internal bodily sounds become significantly amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Clothing and fluids** Rustling of clothing or sounds of fluids in the mouth or throat become distinctly audible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Blood flow and heartbeat** The longer one stays, the more one can hear the blood flow through the brain, described as a ringing or pulsing sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Some individuals can also hear their heartbeat from their chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The presenter experienced feeling each pulse, radiating up the chest like a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Body vibrations** The presenter also reported feeling their body shake slightly with each heartbeat, like a device with a small motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Ear hiss** A low-pitched hum or hiss in the ears might be perceived, potentially due to hearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

The brain appears to recalibrate in silence, making even very small sounds seem much louder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Personal Experience
Despite the prevalent "myth" that one cannot stay in an anechoic chamber for more than 45 minutes without going crazy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, the presenter spent nearly an hour in a BYU anechoic chamber, mostly in complete darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

His experience differed from common reports:
*   He felt "quite comfortable" and found the silence "relaxing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   He did not fall asleep but found it a "nice quiet space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   He believed he could stay for five hours and get work done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   He experienced no weird [[sensory_perceptions_in_soundproof_environments | hallucinations]] or feeling of going crazy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

The presenter concluded that the "myth" regarding the 45-minute limit is busted, but acknowledges that individuals who find small, confined spaces or pitch-black rooms uncomfortable might find the experience unnerving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. The experience is not "pure silence" due to the internal body noises that become prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

Mathematics, which began as a means to quantify the world for purposes like measuring land, predicting planetary motions, and tracking commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, encountered a problem in the Renaissance that had been considered impossible: the general solution to the cubic equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The key to solving this problem involved separating mathematics from the "real world," splitting algebra from geometry, and inventing new numbers termed "imaginary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## The Long-Standing Cubic Problem

In 1494, Luca Pacioli, who was Leonardo da Vinci's mathematics teacher, published "Summa de Arithmetica," a comprehensive summary of all known mathematics in Renaissance Italy at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This work included a section on the cubic equation, typically written as `ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For at least 4,000 years, civilizations including the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, and Persians had attempted to find a general solution but failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Pacioli's conclusion was that a solution to the cubic equation was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

This was surprising given that quadratics (equations without the `x³` term) had been solved thousands of years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The general solution for a quadratic (`-b ± √(b² - 4ac) / 2a`) is common knowledge today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. However, ancient mathematicians derived these solutions using geometry rather than abstract formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Geometry and the Absence of Negative Numbers

Historically, mathematics was expressed through words and pictures rather than equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. For example, to solve `x² + 26x = 27`, ancient mathematicians would visualize `x²` as the area of a square with sides of length `x`, and `26x` as a rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The process of "completing the square" involved manipulating these geometric shapes to form a larger square, thereby finding `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

However, this geometric approach had limitations. It couldn't account for negative solutions (e.g., for `x² + 26x = 27`, `x = -27` is also a solution, but a square with sides of length negative 27 was inconceivable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Consequently, negative numbers were not considered to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This aversion led to multiple versions of the same quadratic equation to ensure all coefficients remained positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The same issue applied to cubics; the Persian mathematician Omar Khayyam (11th century) identified 19 different cubic equations, always keeping coefficients positive, and solved some numerically through intersections of shapes like hyperbolas and circles, but a general solution eluded him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## The Secret Breakthroughs and Public Challenges

Four centuries after Omar Khayyam, the solution to the cubic began to emerge in Renaissance Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Scipione del Ferro and Antonio Fior

Around 1510, Scipione del Ferro, a mathematics professor at the University of Bologna, discovered a method to solve "depressed cubics" (cubic equations with no `x²` term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Crucially, del Ferro kept his solution a secret for nearly two decades, revealing it only on his deathbed in 1526 to his student, Antonio Fior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This secrecy was due to the competitive nature of mathematics in the 1500s, where mathematicians' jobs were secured through public "math duels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia

Fior, though not as talented as del Ferro, boasted about his ability to solve the depressed cubic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This led to a famous math duel on February 12, 1535, where Fior challenged Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Tartaglia, who earned his nickname "Stutterer" due to a childhood injury and was largely self-taught, accepted the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Fior's 30 problems were all depressed cubics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Aware of Fior's claims and the possibility of a solution, Tartaglia set about solving the depressed cubic himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. He accomplished this by extending the concept of "completing the square" into three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. For an equation like `x³ + 9x = 26`, he visualized `x³` as a cube's volume and added volumes to create a larger cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This method, when applied, ingeniously transformed the cubic into a quadratic equation by treating `y³` as a new variable, which could then be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Tartaglia solved all 30 of Fior's problems in just two hours, while Fior couldn't solve a single one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Tartaglia summarized his method as an algorithm, which he recorded in a poem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### Gerolamo Cardano and the General Solution

Tartaglia's victory made him a celebrity, attracting the attention of Gerolamo Cardano, a polymath from Milan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. After persistent efforts and a solemn oath from Cardano not to publish the method, Tartaglia revealed his solution on March 25, 1539 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Cardano immediately began experimenting with Tartaglia's algorithm and, remarkably, discovered a method to solve the *full* cubic equation (including the `x²` term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. He found that by substituting `x - b/3a` for `x`, all `x²` terms cancel out, converting any general cubic into a depressed cubic that Tartaglia's formula could then solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

Desiring to publish this monumental achievement, Cardano faced the dilemma of his oath to Tartaglia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. However, in 1542, during a visit to Bologna, Cardano found del Ferro's original solution in his son-in-law's notebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Since del Ferro's solution predated Tartaglia's, Cardano felt justified in publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

In 1545, Cardano published "Ars Magna" (The Great Art), an updated compendium of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This work presented a unique geometric proof for each of the 13 arrangements of the cubic equation and acknowledged the contributions of Tartaglia, del Ferro, and Fior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Despite the acknowledgment, Tartaglia was greatly displeased, feeling his secret had been betrayed, and this led to continued disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The general solution to the cubic is still often called Cardano's method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## The Birth of Imaginary Numbers

While writing "Ars Magna," Cardano encountered cubic equations that yielded solutions containing the square roots of negative numbers, such as `x³ = 15x + 4` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. When applied to a quadratic like `x² + 40 = 10x` (seeking two numbers that add to 10 and multiply to 40), the quadratic formula also produced square roots of negatives, leading to the conclusion that no real solution existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. For centuries, square roots of negative numbers were seen as mathematics indicating "no solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

However, the cubic equation `x³ = 15x + 4` was different: `x = 4` was clearly a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The formula for the cubic, however, still produced square roots of negatives. Cardano found that the geometric derivation of such problems led to a "geometric paradox," requiring the addition of "negative area" to complete a square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Unable to resolve this, Cardano avoided this case in "Ars Magna," deeming the idea of square roots of negatives "as subtle as it is useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Rafael Bombelli's Breakthrough

Approximately 10 years later, the Italian engineer Rafael Bombelli took up where Cardano left off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Undeterred by the seemingly impossible geometry, Bombelli observed that the square root of a negative "cannot be called either positive or negative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. He posited that terms in Cardano's solution could be combinations of ordinary numbers and this new type of number involving the square root of negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Through this insight, Bombelli found that the two cube roots in Cardano's equation (which involved square roots of negatives) were equivalent to `2 ± √(-1)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. When these were added together, the square roots canceled out, yielding the correct real answer of four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

This "miraculous" result showed that Cardano's method worked, but only if one abandoned the geometric proof that generated it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. "Negative areas" that made no sense in reality had to exist as intermediate steps toward a valid solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

## Legacy and Impact

Over the next century, modern mathematics began to take shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

*   **Francois Viete** (1600s) introduced modern symbolic notation for algebra, ending the millennia-long tradition of math problems described through drawings and words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Geometry was no longer the sole source of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.
*   **Rene Descartes** extensively used square roots of negatives, popularizing them and naming them "imaginary numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   **Euler** later introduced the letter 'i' to represent the square root of negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. When combined with "regular" numbers, they formed complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

The cubic equation's solution led to the invention of these new numbers and the liberation of algebra from the constraints of geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. By accepting concepts that seemed to defy physical reality, mathematics became more powerful and complete, capable of solving real problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

This breakthrough had profound implications, even centuries later. In 1925, when Erwin Schrödinger sought a wave equation to describe quantum particles, he famously incorporated 'i', the square root of negative one, into the Schrödinger equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Despite initial discomfort among physicists, the unique properties of imaginary numbers, particularly their role in representing rotations in the complex plane and encoding both sine and cosine waves (e.g., `e^ix`), made them indispensable for describing wave phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. As physicist Freeman Dyson noted, "Schrödinger put the square root of minus one into the equation, and suddenly it made sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. This showed that nature itself operates with complex numbers, a discovery that came as a complete surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

Thus, imaginary numbers, initially a "quirky, intermediate step" in solving the cubic, proved to be fundamental to our understanding of reality, demonstrating that abandoning strict adherence to observable reality could lead to a deeper truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This stands as a key example of a [[definition_and_implications_of_revolutions_in_mathematics | revolution in mathematics]], fundamentally altering how problems were approached and leading to unforeseen discoveries, contributing to the broader [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics_discoveries | history of physics and mathematics discoveries]].

The study of geometry, initially codified by Euclid around 300 BC, has evolved significantly, particularly with the understanding of **spacetime curvature** and its implications for the shape of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Euclid's "Elements," a foundational mathematics text for over 2,000 years, introduced a system of definitions, common notions, and five postulates to prove 465 theorems covering geometry and number theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Euclid's Postulates and the Parallel Postulate

Euclid's first four postulates were generally accepted as self-evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>:
1.  A straight line can be drawn between any two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
2.  A straight line can be extended indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
3.  A circle can be drawn with any center and radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
4.  All right angles are equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

However, the fifth postulate, often called the Parallel Postulate, was problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Its complex wording made mathematicians suspect it was a theorem that could be proven from the first four postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Despite over 2,000 years of attempts, no one succeeded in proving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The Parallel Postulate can be reformulated as: given a line and a point not on that line, there is a single unique line through the point that will be parallel to the first line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

Mathematicians attempted "proof by contradiction" by assuming the fifth postulate was false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. One alternative hypothesis was that no parallel lines could be drawn through the point, but this was ruled out as it contradicted the second postulate (lines can be extended indefinitely) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The other alternative was that more than one parallel line could be drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. No contradiction was found with this assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Emergence of [[NonEuclidean Geometry|Non-Euclidean Geometry]]

Around 1820, JÃ¡nos Bolyai, a 17-year-old student, proposed that the fifth postulate might be independent of the other four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. He imagined a world where more than one parallel line could be drawn through a point not on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This concept required a curved surface, where the shortest paths between two points, known as [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics|geodesics]], appear bent but are considered "straight" on that surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This led to the discovery of hyperbolic geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Hyperbolic Geometry
Hyperbolic geometry can be visualized as a surface that expands exponentially outwards, like a crumpled piece of crocheting, leading to parallel lines pushing apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The Poincare Disk Model illustrates this by mapping the infinite hyperbolic plane onto a finite disk, where triangles appear smaller further from the center but are actually the same size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. In this model, straight lines are arcs of circles that intersect the disk at 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Bolyai found this geometry to be mathematically consistent, leading him to declare, "Out of nothing, I have created a strange new universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Carl Friedrich Gauss independently explored similar concepts, coining the term "[[NonEuclidean Geometry|non-Euclidean geometry]]" to describe geometries where Euclid's first four postulates hold but the fifth does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. He noted that in this geometry, the three angles of a triangle could become arbitrarily small, yet the triangle's area would never exceed a definite limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### Spherical Geometry
Another form of [[NonEuclidean Geometry|non-Euclidean geometry]] is spherical geometry, which describes the surface of a sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. On a sphere, "straight lines" are parts of great circles (circles with the largest possible circumference) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. In spherical geometry, any two great circles will always intersect, meaning there are no parallel lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Early mathematicians dismissed spherical geometry as non-Euclidean because lines cannot be extended indefinitely, violating Euclid's second postulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. However, in 1854, Bernhard Riemann generalized the second postulate from "infinite extension" to "unbounded," allowing spherical geometry to be considered a valid [[NonEuclidean Geometry|non-Euclidean geometry]] where the fifth postulate (no parallel lines) holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

## Riemann's Vision of Variable Curvature

Riemann further proposed a geometry where curvature could differ from place to place, allowing for areas that are flat, slightly curved, or strongly curved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. This generalized geometry could also be extended to three or more dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. In 1868, Eugenio Beltrami formally proved that hyperbolic and spherical geometries are just as consistent as Euclidean flat geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## [[Applications of NonEuclidean Geometry in General Relativity|Applications of Non-Euclidean Geometry in General Relativity]]

The profound implications of these [[NonEuclidean Geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] became clear with [[General Theory of Relativity and gravity|Einstein's General Theory of Relativity]], published in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. [[General Theory of Relativity and gravity|Einstein's theory]] describes gravity not as a force, but as the manifestation of mass-energy curving spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. Objects moving through this [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics|curved spacetime]] follow the shortest paths, or [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics|geodesics]], which appear curved to a distant observer because of the underlying curvature of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

[[Astronomical observations supporting general relativity|Astronomical observations supporting General Relativity]] include gravitational lensing, where massive galaxies curve spacetime, causing light from distant objects like supernovae to take multiple paths to Earth, creating multiple images or delayed replays of the same event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. The detection of gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime caused by cosmic events like merging [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes|black holes]], further validates the theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

## Measuring the Shape of the Universe

The different [[NonEuclidean Geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] predict different properties for triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>:
*   **Flat (Euclidean) geometry**: Angles of a triangle sum to exactly 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
*   **Spherical (Elliptic) geometry**: Angles sum to more than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **Hyperbolic geometry**: Angles sum to less than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

To determine the shape of the universe, astronomers look for cosmic triangles on the largest possible scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the earliest light detectable from the universe (380,000 years old), provides ideal "spots" or temperature variations to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. By comparing the predicted size of these spots (based on early universe evolution) to their measured angular size on the sky, the universe's curvature can be inferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.

Data from the Planck mission shows that the universe is remarkably flat, with a curvature of 0.0007 Â± 0.0019, which is essentially zero within the margin of error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. This flatness is considered serendipitous, as even a slight difference in the universe's average mass-energy density (e.g., one extra or one fewer hydrogen atom per cubic meter) would result in a spherical or hyperbolic curvature, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

The **[[General Theory of Relativity and gravity|General Theory of Relativity]]** remains one of our best physical theories of reality, with its core understanding rooted in the paradoxical and seemingly absurd [[NonEuclidean Geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] that arose from mathematicians' long-standing inquiry into Euclid's fifth postulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

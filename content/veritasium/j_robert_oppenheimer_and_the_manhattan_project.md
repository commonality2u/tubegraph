J. Robert Oppenheimer is regarded by some as potentially the most important physicist to have ever lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Although he never won a Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, he significantly altered the world more than many Nobel laureates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Under his guidance, leading physicists of the 20th century constructed the [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic bomb]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, irrevocably changing the course of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His work has influenced every war fought and every peace agreement reached since the end of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Oppenheimer also created the means for humanity to self-destruct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Early Life and Academic Struggles

In 1925, at the age of 21, Oppenheimer was a student at Cambridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. He was struggling with experimental work and found it "a terrible bore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, feeling he wasn't learning anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. He had been attempting to create thin films of beryllium for electron studies in J.J. Thomson's laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Oppenheimer was clumsy and poor at this type of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. He began avoiding lab duties, instead attending lectures and reading physics journals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. During this period, he became captivated by the emerging field of quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Despite being surrounded by brilliant physicists like Rutherford and Chadwick, Oppenheimer was deeply unhappy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### The Poisoned Apple Incident

While in a state of emotional anguish, Oppenheimer attempted to poison his physics tutor, Patrick Blackett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. He placed an apple laced with toxic chemicals on Blackett's desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The specific chemical used is debated, with conflicting reports suggesting cyanide or another substance that would only cause sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Oppenheimer himself confirmed this incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Fortunately, Blackett did not eat the apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The university authorities became aware of the attempt, but Oppenheimer's father, Julius Oppenheimer, successfully lobbied Cambridge to avoid criminal charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Due to his family's wealth, Oppenheimer was not expelled but was required to attend periodic counseling sessions with a psychiatrist in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Thriving in Göttingen

In the summer of 1926, Oppenheimer moved to the University of Göttingen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The department chairman, Max Born, had coined the term "Quantum Mechanics" two years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Born was a nurturing teacher who had fostered the work of future quantum mechanics luminaries such as Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Enrico Fermi, and Eugene Wigner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Oppenheimer's class also included notable figures like Paul Dirac and John Von Neumann <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Unlike Cambridge, which focused on experimental physics, Göttingen was centered on theoretical physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Under Born's mentorship, Oppenheimer flourished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, finding a community of like-minded individuals obsessed with physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. His mental health improved, and he found the work challenging and almost pleasant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. At 23, Oppenheimer earned his PhD in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, writing his thesis in German on the quantum theory of continuous spectra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. He published over a dozen papers during his two years at Göttingen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, many expanding on Heisenberg's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Oppenheimer and Heisenberg, who was only three years his senior, met in 1927 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. There was no way to know that 15 years later, they would be rivals racing to build the first nuclear bomb for the USA and Nazi Germany, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## The Path to the Atomic Bomb

Before the 1930s, it was believed impossible to extract significant energy from radioactive atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Radioactivity, discovered by Henri Becquerel, Marie Curie, and Pierre Curie, was seen as a passive process of unstable atoms decaying unpredictably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. In 1933, Ernest Rutherford called anyone expecting power from atomic transformations "talking moonshine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, and Albert Einstein stated there was "not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Breaking the Nucleus

To break an atomic nucleus, one method involved accelerating a positively charged proton through a large electric field and smashing it into a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton successfully did this in 1932, using 250,000 volts to accelerate protons into lithium nuclei, breaking them apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. However, only about one in a billion protons hit and split a lithium nucleus, making it an ineffective way to generate energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

The discovery of the neutron in 1932 provided another path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This subatomic particle, slightly heavier than a proton, carries no electric charge, meaning it wouldn't be repelled by a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. In 1933, Leo Szilard conceived of using neutrons to split nuclei, theorizing that if an element could be split by neutrons and emit two neutrons upon absorbing one, it could sustain a nuclear chain reaction if assembled in a sufficiently large mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. At the time, no such element was known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### The Discovery of Fission

On January 29, 1939, physicist Luis Alvarez rushed to Oppenheimer's office after reading a newspaper article in *The San Francisco Chronicle* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The article reported that German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann had successfully split a uranium atom by bombarding it with neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Oppenheimer was initially skeptical, telling Alvarez, "That's impossible," and attempting to mathematically disprove fission on his blackboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. However, after Alvarez replicated the experiment the next day and invited Oppenheimer to observe, Oppenheimer not only acknowledged the authenticity of the reaction but also speculated that it could release extra neutrons, potentially leading to power generation or bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

When a single uranium-235 atom splits, it loses a tiny amount of mass, released as energy, following Einstein's mass-energy equivalence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. While this energy is minuscule per atom, the vast number of atoms in a kilogram of uranium (a trillion trillion) means the total energy quickly accumulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### The Manhattan Project Begins

By August 1939, many scientists were convinced of the possibility of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Albert Einstein, who had previously believed nuclear bombs were impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, signed a letter, actually written by Szilard, to President Franklin Roosevelt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The letter warned of potential nuclear weapons development and noted Germany's access to uranium from Czechoslovakia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Roosevelt then established an informal uranium committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

After two years of inactivity, Roosevelt upgraded the committee to the S-1 Committee in 1941, with the explicit goal of developing an [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic bomb]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. In May 1942, Oppenheimer was hired as the coordinator of rapid rupture for this committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Oppenheimer's Leadership Role

After his PhD, Oppenheimer became a physics professor at UC Berkeley and Caltech, where his brilliance blossomed across nuclear physics, quantum field theory, and astrophysics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. He developed several Nobel Prize-winning ideas, and one of his students, Willis Lamb, became a Nobel laureate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. However, Oppenheimer himself, though nominated three times, never won the Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Murray Gell-Mann attributed this to Oppenheimer lacking "Sitzfleisch," meaning the patience for long calculations or papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Wolfgang Pauli noted that Oppenheimer's ideas were good, but his calculations were often incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Despite this, Oppenheimer's charisma and ability to generate ideas made him an exceptional leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

On September 18, 1942, General Leslie Groves was appointed head of the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Groves quickly began acquiring resources, ordering 1200 tons of uranium ore on day one and purchasing the Oak Ridge site for refinement the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The following month, Groves made the surprising decision to appoint Oppenheimer as the science director of the Los Alamos laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, making him the chief architect of the [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic bomb]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

Concerns existed within the military establishment: Oppenheimer lacked a Nobel Prize, administrative experience, and was a theoretical physicist with no equipment knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Furthermore, he had ties to the Communist Party, including his wife, Catherine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. However, Groves was impressed by Oppenheimer's ambition and his ability to grasp problems across physics, chemistry, engineering, and metallurgy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Groves considered Oppenheimer a "real genius" who knew about everything except sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Despite their ideological differences—Oppenheimer a communist and Groves a staunch conservative—Groves was convinced Oppenheimer would build the bomb before the Nazis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Isidor Rabi later called Groves's decision "a real stroke of genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

Oppenheimer proposed Los Alamos, New Mexico, for the project's isolated and sparsely populated site, a place he loved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. He had severely underestimated the logistical challenges; he initially estimated needing about six scientists, but the project ultimately involved 764 scientists (302 at Los Alamos) and over 600,000 people in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

## Nuclear Fission and Bomb Design

By late 1942, the idea of making an [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic bomb]] seemed likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. On December 2, 1942, Enrico Fermi's team at the University of Chicago created the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, Pile-1, located under the football field stands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. It produced about half a watt of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. The key difference between a nuclear power plant and a bomb lies in the multiplication factor (K), which describes how many neutrons hit the next atom, causing it to split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. A K of one leads to a stable chain reaction, less than one causes it to die, and more than one causes it to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

The simplest method for a nuclear bomb involves assembling enough fissile material to create a runaway chain reaction; this amount is called the critical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. For uranium-235, the critical mass is about 52 kilograms (a 17 cm sphere) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, while for plutonium-239, it's about 10 kilograms (a 10 cm sphere) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Gun-Type Design

For the first few years, scientists focused on a "gun-type" bomb design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This involves two sub-critical slabs of uranium-235 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. A conventional explosive, like cordite, rapidly fires one slab (the "bullet") towards the other, combining their mass to exceed the critical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. The chain reaction begins about 25 centimeters before impact, leading to an explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. This design is not very efficient, with only a small percentage of uranium undergoing fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. A peculiar challenge arose in ensuring the uranium slug moved smoothly through the barrel; the only effective lubricant found was oil from sperm whales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

Only about 0.7% of naturally occurring uranium is U235, the fissile fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. U235 absorbs a neutron, briefly becomes U236, then splits, releasing an average of 2.4 neutrons per fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. To make a bomb, scientists used massive mass spectrometers to separate and concentrate U235, resulting in enriched uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

### Plutonium and Implosion Design

Another option emerged in early 1941 with the synthesis of a new element: plutonium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Plutonium-239 is formed when uranium-238 absorbs a neutron, becoming unstable uranium-239, which decays into Neptunium, and then plutonium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. Plutonium-239 is an excellent nuclear fuel with a critical mass of only about 10 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. It is also cheaper to produce than enriched uranium-235 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. However, plutonium reacts too quickly for a gun-type device, which would lead to a "fizzle," where only a tiny fraction of the fuel undergoes fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

The solution for plutonium was the "implosion bomb" design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. Critical mass changes with material density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. Six kilograms of plutonium-239 won't explode under normal pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>, but compressing it increases atom proximity and the chance of a neutron hitting a nucleus, thus lowering the critical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. Conventional explosives set off around a plutonium ball can compress it enough to initiate a nuclear chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. Additional methods to lower critical mass include surrounding the sphere with neutron-reflecting material and using a neutron source to kick-start the chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. For the first implosion bomb, scientists created a device called the "urchin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>, a seven-gram pellet of beryllium and polonium separated by nickel and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The shockwave from the detonation would mix the beryllium and polonium, causing the polonium's alpha particles to make beryllium release a flood of neutrons, initiating the nuclear chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

## The Trinity Test

With an [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic bomb]] never having been made before, Oppenheimer and his team at Los Alamos needed to act quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. By 1945, President Truman wanted to test the weapon before the Potsdam Conference, which began on July 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. The earliest possible date for the bomb's readiness was July 16, which was chosen for the test, codenamed Trinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.

The night before the test, Oppenheimer was extremely nervous, especially after a previous test firing of the explosives without the plutonium core had failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. He recited a stanza from the Bhagavad Gita, which he had translated himself from Sanskrit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>:
> In battle, in forest, at the precipice in the mountains, on the dark great sea, in the midst of javelins and arrows in sleep, in confusion, in the depths of shame, the good deeds a man has done before defend him. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>

### The Atmosphere Concern

More terrifying than the possibility of the bomb failing was the fear that it would work *too well* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. Around 1942, Oppenheimer discussed with Arthur Compton the "terrible possibility" that a nuclear test could end the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. The concern was that the bomb's extreme temperatures could trigger fusion in the atmosphere's tiny fraction of hydrogen gas (one part in 2 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. This energy release could fuse more hydrogen, break apart hydrogen from water vapor to fuse it, and continue until the entire Earth's atmosphere became a giant fusion bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. Compton recalled Oppenheimer also feared the nitrogen in the air, though less unstable, might also be set off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. Most scientists quickly realized this scenario was unlikely and did not take it seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

### The Detonation

The Trinity test, delayed by a storm, was detonated at 5:29 and 21 seconds AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. The high explosive squeezed the plutonium core inwards, and the shockwave mixed the beryllium and polonium in the "urchin," releasing a flood of neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. The urchin worked, jump-starting the nuclear reaction, and there was no way to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. Just six kilograms of plutonium produced an explosion equivalent to nearly 25,000 tons of TNT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. The New Mexico mountains were illuminated brighter than daytime, the shockwave was felt over 160 kilometers away, and the mushroom cloud rose 12 kilometers into the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. The desert sand melted into a glassy mineral known as trinitite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. Fortunately, the blast did not ignite the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

## After the War

On August 6, 1945, the Boeing B-29 Flying Fortress dropped "Little Boy," a gun-type nuclear bomb containing 64 kilograms of enriched uranium, on Hiroshima <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. The nitrocellulose ignited, pushing the U235 slugs together to exceed critical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. The explosion, equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT, killed nearly 70,000 people, with another 70,000 dying from burns and radiation poisoning in subsequent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. Three days later, an implosion-type bomb, similar to the Trinity device, was dropped on Nagasaki, killing an estimated 80,000 more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. Over 95% of the 225,000 casualties in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were civilians, mostly women and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

Reflecting on the Trinity test in 1965, Oppenheimer recalled another verse from the Gita:
> He knew the world would not be the same. Few people laughed, few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the (speaking foreign language). The Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now I am become death the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that one way or another. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>

After the war, Oppenheimer became a national hero, appearing on the cover of Time Magazine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. In 1947, he became director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and chairman of the General Advisory Committee, where he advised on nuclear weapons issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. He used this position to advocate for [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cooperation | arms control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.

## [[Postwar legacy of Oppenheimer and nuclear arms race | Postwar Legacy and the Hydrogen Bomb]]

In August 1949, when the Soviet Union tested their first [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic weapon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>, the US military decided to develop a more powerful weapon: the hydrogen bomb, or "The Super" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. Oppenheimer opposed its [[oppenheimers_opposition_to_the_hydrogen_bomb | development]] on ethical grounds and out of concern it would ignite an [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cooperation | arms race]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. Despite his opposition, the Truman administration proceeded, and three years later, Ivy Mike, the first hydrogen bomb, was tested in the Marshall Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. It had a yield of 10.4 megatons of TNT, 400 times more powerful than the Trinity test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

A hydrogen bomb is effectively three bombs in one: a conventional bomb, a fission bomb, and a fusion bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. Conventional explosives trigger a fission reaction, which then creates enough temperature and pressure to fuse deuterium and tritium, releasing immense energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. In 1961, the Soviet Union tested the Tsar Bomba, the most powerful explosion ever detonated, five times more powerful than Ivy Mike and around 2000 times more powerful than Trinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. This type of [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cooperation | arms race]] was exactly what Oppenheimer had feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

Partially due to his opposition to the hydrogen bomb and his calls to avert an [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cooperation | arms race]], Oppenheimer was put on trial to revoke his security clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. He had been surveilled during and after the Manhattan Project, with many wiretaps being illegal and warrantless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. He was questioned about his Communist Party ties, including an affair with party member Jean Tatlock while leading Los Alamos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. He was accused of treason and espionage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. In December 1953, his security clearance was suspended, making international news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

In 1964, German playwright Heinar Kipphardt wrote a play about Oppenheimer's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. Oppenheimer hated the script, threatening to sue, particularly disliking the final scene where his character realizes "We have been doing the work of the devil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. For Oppenheimer, the situation was always more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. He believed the weapon would play a part if the war was not ended diplomatically, and that the alternative—an invasion campaign—would have been far more terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. He did, however, state that Hiroshima was "far more costly in life and suffering inhumane than it needed to have been, to have been an effective argument for ending the war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>, acknowledging this was "easy to say after the fact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.

In 1965, when asked about proposed talks with the Soviet Union to halt [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cooperation | nuclear weapons proliferation]], Oppenheimer responded, "It should have been done the day after Trinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. He was diagnosed with throat cancer later that year, a lifelong smoker, and died on February 18, 1967, at age 62 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.

Relativity Space, a startup utilizing the world's largest 3D metal printer, envisions a future where rockets are almost entirely 3D printed, leading to significant advancements in space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Their aim is to print an entire rocket, including fuel tanks and rocket engines, in just 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Expanding Human Experience in Space
Relativity Space's long-term vision is to establish an industrial base on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. The founder believes that dozens or hundreds of companies are needed to make Mars colonization a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. The company aims to shrink its current factory and [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printing]] technology into a form factor that can be launched to Mars to facilitate this industrial development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. This endeavor is seen as existential, expanding the possibilities of human experience and culture beyond Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

## Design and Manufacturing Innovations
The [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | impact of 3D printing]] extends to transforming the very design of rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. With [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printing]], engineers can create parts that would be impractical or impossible using traditional manufacturing methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

Key innovations include:
*   **Complex Geometries** [[benefits_and_challenges_of_3d_printed_rockets | 3D printing]] allows for smooth, curvy, and even bio-inspired designs that are just as easy to print as standard structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Many features in new rocket designs could not be manufactured without [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Future versions of rockets, like Terran R, will incorporate "dragonfly wing type structures" and integrate tubing into printed housings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Part Consolidation** One of the major [[benefits_and_challenges_of_3d_printed_rockets | benefits of 3D printing]] is the significant reduction in the number of individual parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. For example, a rocket engine injector, traditionally made of over a thousand individual pieces requiring nine months to produce, can be [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printed]] as a single piece in two weeks, costing 10 times less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Similarly, rocket nozzles with intricate cooling channels, which traditionally involved welding thousands of small pipes, can be [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printed]] as a single integrated part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. A fully [[benefits_and_challenges_of_3d_printed_rockets | 3D printed rocket]] is projected to have 100 times fewer parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Material Properties** Counterintuitively, [[benefits_and_challenges_of_3d_printed_rockets | 3D printed metals]] can be stronger than those built traditionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This is achieved by developing custom alloys and leveraging the rapid melting, cooling, and solidification process during printing to create strong materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Rapid Iteration and Automation** [[benefits_and_challenges_of_3d_printed_rockets | 3D printing]] enables rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Parts can be built quickly, tested, and then redesigned rapidly and printed again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This is part of a "software-driven manufacturing" approach where part geometries are controlled via CAD models, allowing for extremely fast design changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Building a whole engine takes about a month, allowing for continuous improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printing]] also brings automation to aerospace, unlike traditional methods which often involve manual assembly of hundreds of thousands to millions of parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Cost Reduction** [[benefits_and_challenges_of_3d_printed_rockets | 3D printing]] is significantly cheaper than traditional manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Relativity Space's rockets are about five times cheaper initially, with a goal to achieve 10 to 100 times cheaper costs with fully reusable rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. This cost reduction could make space travel much more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

## Trajectory to Deep Space
Relativity Space's first rocket, Terran One, is primarily for low-Earth orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. However, their next rocket, Terran R, is designed to send payloads to the Moon and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

While there's ongoing debate about whether rockets will always be [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printed]] in the future, particularly if flying very high volumes makes dedicated traditional machinery cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>, Relativity Space has positioned itself as an expert in [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printing rocket hardware]] by applying the technology to areas previously dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

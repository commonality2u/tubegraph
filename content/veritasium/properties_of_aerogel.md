Aerogel is recognized as the world's lightest and least dense solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A typical piece might have a mass of only 1.22 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, which is only a few times the mass of the same volume of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This is because aerogel is composed of 99.8% air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Some aerogels are so light that if all the air were removed, they would be less dense than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Structural Composition

Aerogel originates from a gel, which has a skeleton with nano-sized pores that provide rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This skeleton constitutes about 1% of the gel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. For silica aerogel, the remaining 3% solid is amorphous silica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

The [[history_and_invention_of_aerogel | invention of aerogel]] by Professor Samuel Kistler in 1931 involved removing the liquid from a jelly without affecting its solid structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This process prevents the solid structure from shrinking, which typically happens when liquid molecules are evaporated and pull on the solid structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Kistler's solution involved two steps:
1.  Replacing the original liquid with another, such as swapping water for alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
2.  Heating the gel in a high-pressure vessel (autoclave) to the critical point of the liquid, transforming it into a supercritical fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. At this point, there is no distinction between liquid and gas, and the molecules no longer pull on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
Once the vessel is depressurized, the intact nanoporous solid skeleton, which is aerogel, remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Thermal Properties

Aerogel is an exceptional [[aerogel_as_a_thermal_insulator | thermal insulator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, being a better insulator than air itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This property is due to the Knudsen effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, where the width of its nanoscale pores is smaller than the mean free path of air molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This makes it difficult for hot, fast-moving air molecules to diffuse through the aerogel and transfer heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

[[Practical applications of aerogel | Practical applications of aerogel]] stemming from its insulating properties include NASA's use of aerogel insulation on Mars rovers (Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and future missions) to protect electronics from cold Martian nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. It is also considered for building insulation in extreme environments like Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, where inches of aerogel could replace feet of fiberglass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## Optical Properties

Aerogel exhibits unique optical properties due to its nanoscale structure:
*   **Transparency:** It is almost impossible to see on a light background because it is very transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Bluish Tint:** When viewed against a darker background, it displays a slight bluish color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This phenomenon is similar to why the sky is blue and is explained by Rayleigh scattering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The intensity of scattered light is proportional to 1 over wavelength to the power of 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, meaning it scatters shorter wavelengths like blue much more than yellow or red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Wavelength-dependent Opacity:** Aerogel appears opaque in the ultraviolet spectrum but transparent in the infrared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **"Portable Sunset" Effect:** When held against a blue sky, aerogel appears yellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This is because the aerogel scatters out the blue light, allowing longer wavelengths like yellows and oranges to pass through to the eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This effect is comparable to observing a sunset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Other Physical Properties and Developments

Originally, silica aerogel is hydrophilic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, meaning it absorbs water and is easily damaged by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. However, methods exist to make it waterproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

While aerogel is generally brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> and easily crumbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, scientists are working on [[future_developments_and_challenges_for_aerogel | reducing costs and increasing durability]] and elasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Significant progress has already been made in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

Beyond insulation, NASA has used aerogel for specialized tasks, such as catching dust from a comet during the Stardust mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Its low density and porous structure allow particles traveling at high speeds (around six kilometers per second) to enter the aerogel and gradually lose energy as they break apart the network, eventually coming to a stop without vaporizing, unlike if they hit a solid surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

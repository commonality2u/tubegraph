[[aerogel_properties_and_composition | Aerogel]] is renowned as the world's lightest solid material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Its unique characteristics include an unusual acoustic property, thermal insulation, and distinct interactions with water, which can be modified for various [[applications_and_uses_of_aerogel | applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Unique Sound
When tapped, [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] produces a metallic ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This property was first noted by its inventor, Samuel Kistler, in 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Thermal Insulation
[[aerogel_properties_and_composition | Aerogel]] is an [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | excellent thermal insulator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, possessing [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | extraordinary thermal insulation]] capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

*   **Effectiveness**: A thin layer of [[aerogel]] can insulate against extreme heat; for example, a blowtorch flame, which can reach between 1500 and 2000 degrees Celsius, was applied to the material, while a finger behind it only felt warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The surface temperature of the [[aerogel]] itself during such a test reached approximately 907 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Thermal Conductivity**: Traditional silica [[aerogel]] has a thermal conductivity of about 15 milliwatts per meter Kelvin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This makes it two to three times better at insulating than styrofoam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Some polymer-based [[aerogels]] have a thermal conductivity between 20 to 26 milliwatts per meter Kelvin, offering one and a half to two times better insulation than styrofoam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Applications**: Its insulating properties are utilized in industrial settings, such as insulating subsea oil pipelines and refineries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. A one-centimeter-thick [[aerogel]] blanket can provide the same insulation as three centimeters of mineral wool or fiberglass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Brittleness and Durability
[[aerogel]] is naturally brittle and breaks easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. To make it more usable, it can be:

*   **Combined with Binders**: [[silica_aerogel_particles_with_non-flammable_binder | Aerogel particles can be combined with a non-flammable binder]] to form a sticky paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Incorporated into Composites**: It can be integrated into [[aerogel_composites_and_materials_innovation | composite materials]] like blankets, such as fiberglass infused with [[aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This [[aerogel_composites_and_materials_innovation | compositing]] allows the material to be flexed, cut, sewn, and wrapped, overcoming its traditional fragility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Characteristics
Normal [[silica_aerogel_is_hydrophilic | silica aerogel is hydrophilic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, meaning it absorbs water readily.

*   **Water Absorption**: This is due to its [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | nanoscale sponge-like structure]], providing a lot of surface area (an ice cube-sized piece can have half a football field of surface area) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, and the presence of O-H (hydroxyl) groups on its structure that attract water molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. When it absorbs liquid, the [[aerogel]] structure tends to collapse, causing irreversible damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. It can absorb up to 25 times its weight in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Water Repellence (Hydrophobicity)**: To make [[aerogel]] [[hydrophobic_and_hydrophilic_characteristics_of_aerogel | water-repellent]] and impervious to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, a reactive chemical hydrophobe is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This chemical rearranges with the O-H groups inside the [[aerogel]], creating large non-polar groups that repel water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Replacing just 30% of the O-H groups makes the [[aerogel]] perfectly water-repellent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. When applied to skin, [[hydrophobic_and_hydrophilic_characteristics_of_aerogel | hydrophobic aerogel]] creates a thin layer of air that makes the skin appear silvery underwater due to total internal reflection and prevents water from touching the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Porous Structure and Surface Area
All [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel materials]] are nanostructured with nano-sized pores, typically around 20 nanometers in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. They are composed of over 50% air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, which contributes to their incredibly lightweight nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This highly porous structure gives [[aerogel]] a very large surface area, making it effective at absorbing molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

*   **Applications**:
    *   **Physical Insecticide**: Its absorbent nature allows it to act as a physical insecticide by adhering to insects' outer skin and drawing out moisture and oils, causing them to dry out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   **Moisture Regulation in Museums**: [[aerogel]] is used in museum cases, such as the one for the Mona Lisa, to passively regulate moisture levels by absorbing excess moisture and releasing it when humidity decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   [[uses_of_aerogel_in_space_exploration | Mars Quake Detection]]: Zeolite particles dispersed throughout [[aerogel]] allow it to absorb moisture even at very low pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This property was critical for maintaining the high vacuum required for the sensitive seismometers in the NASA InSight mission to detect Mars quakes, effectively acting as a power-free, lightweight vacuum pump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Material Composition and Safety
While silica [[aerogel]] is common, [[aerogel]] can be made from various materials, including polymers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. There is often a trade-off between thermal and mechanical properties among different [[aerogel]] types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. For example, a polyimide [[aerogel]] developed by NASA is a great insulating material and is non-flammable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

When using [[aerogel]] composites like fiberglass-infused blankets, silica [[aerogel]] dust may shed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This amorphous silica dust is considered very safe and is not comparable to hazardous substances like quartz fiber or asbestos. The body can readily capture and expel it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

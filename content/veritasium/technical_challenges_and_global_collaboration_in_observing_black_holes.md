The [[firstever_black_hole_image_by_event_horizon_telescope | first-ever image of a black hole]], released by the [[first_image_of_a_black_hole_by_event_horizon_telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]] collaboration on April 10, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, marked a monumental achievement in astronomy. This image, showing plasma orbiting the supermassive black hole in M87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, was made possible by overcoming significant technical hurdles through unprecedented global collaboration.

## Technical Challenges in Imaging Black Holes

Observing [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black holes]] presents numerous [[space_exploration_challenges | challenges]] due to their immense distance and the fundamental laws of physics:

*   **Apparent Size and Resolution Limit**
    The image of the black hole in M87 appears "fuzzy" because, from Earth's perspective, it is incredibly tiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. While the black hole itself is supermassive—with a mass 6.5 billion times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a> and a shadow nearly the size of our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>—it is located 53.5 million light-years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Its angular size on the sky is only about 40 micro arcseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, pushing the very limit of what is technologically discernible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. To achieve this resolution, the basic law of physics known as the diffraction limit required a telescope effectively the size of Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

*   **Electromagnetic Wavelength Selection**
    To capture features close to the event horizon and penetrate through obscuring matter like the [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] and interstellar dust, scientists utilized electromagnetic waves with a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters (radio waves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. This specific part of the spectrum was crucial for the imaging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

*   **[[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | Relativistic Effects]]**
    The plasma orbiting the black hole travels near the speed of light, causing it to appear brighter when moving towards the observer and dimmer when moving away. This phenomenon is known as [[relativistic_beaming and plasma orbiting the black hole | relativistic beaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_the_black_hole | Relativistic beaming]] is also why only one of M87's jets, the one pointing almost straight at Earth, is visible in images from the Hubble Space Telescope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Furthermore, the extreme warping of space-time around the black hole means light can be lensed from parts of the accretion disk even behind the black hole, appearing above and below the shadow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

*   **Challenges with Sagittarius A***
    The supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, Sagittarius A*, also observed by the Event Horizon Telescope, has not yet had an image released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Although it is much closer (around 26,000 light-years away) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>, it is also much smaller (only four million times the mass of our Sun) and less active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. The plasma around Sagittarius A* orbits much faster, with variations occurring every four to thirty minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>, making it more challenging to capture a stable image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

## Global Collaboration: The Event Horizon Telescope

Given the impracticality of building a single Earth-sized telescope, the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration employed an innovative approach:

*   **Distributed Network of Telescopes**
    The scientists used eight telescopes spread across the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>, working together as a virtual Earth-sized observatory. These telescopes simultaneously observed M87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. As the Earth rotated, it helped to fill in the data gaps, simulating the complete aperture of the desired Earth-sized telescope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

*   **International Scientific Effort**
    This monumental achievement was the result of a collaborative effort involving approximately 200 scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Their pursuit of this seemingly impossible goal culminated in an amazing discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. The striking image of the black hole in M87 confirms the existence of [[concept of black holes and their properties | black holes]] beyond a shadow of a doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a> and spectacularly supports the [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | General Theory of Relativity]], published over a hundred years ago, even at the limits of its testability in the strongest gravities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

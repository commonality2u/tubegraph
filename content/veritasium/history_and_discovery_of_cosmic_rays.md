[[Cosmic rays and their impact on computers | Cosmic rays]] are an invisible phenomenon that permeate the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. They consist of high-energy radiation from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Early Discoveries

The investigation into cosmic rays began with the discovery of radioactivity.
In 1896, [[History of Physics and Mathematics | Henri Becquerel]] discovered radioactivity using uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Scientists then sought ways to measure radioactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

One method was using a gold leaf electrometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. When charged, the leaf is repelled, and the amount of charge can be measured by its angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. If ionizing radiation enters the chamber, it rips electrons off air molecules, creating charges that discharge the leaf over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Theodore Wolf's Experiment (1910)
In 1910, Theodore Wolf took his electrometer to the top of the Eiffel Tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. He expected that at 300 meters up, the radiation would be only a few percent of ground radiation, as radioactivity was found in the soil and rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. However, he found only a slight decrease in radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Victor Hess's Balloon Flights (1911-1912)
Inspired by Wolf's findings, Austrian physicist Victor Hess decided to extend this experiment in 1911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. He loaded electrometers into a hydrogen balloon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

*   **First Flights**: In his initial two flights, reaching an altitude of 1,100 meters, he observed no fundamental change in radiation compared to ground values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Further Flights**: The next year, Hess conducted seven balloon flights, ascending to an altitude of 5,200 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Remarkable Discovery**: He discovered that while there was an initial drop in radiation for the first few hundred meters, above one kilometer, the level increased with increasing altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. At his maximum height, the radiation level was several times greater than on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Conclusion**: This indicated the radiation was coming from the sky, not the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Hess also conducted a flight during a solar eclipse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The readings were unaffected, even with the sun half-covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This led him to conclude:
> "Since no influence of the eclipse on the penetrating radiation was noted, we conclude that even if a part of the radiation should be of cosmic origin, it hardly emanates from the sun." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>

Victor Hess had discovered [[Cosmic rays and their impact on computers | cosmic rays]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936, sharing it with Carl Anderson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Nature and Origin of Cosmic Rays

Today, it is known that [[Cosmic rays and their impact on computers | cosmic rays]] are not electromagnetic rays but particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   Approximately 90% are protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   About 9% are helium nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   About 1% are heavier nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Sources of Cosmic Rays
*   **Low Energy**: Some originate from the sun, but these have comparatively low energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **High Energy**: High-energy [[Cosmic rays and their impact on computers | cosmic rays]], moving very close to the speed of light, come from exploding stars (supernovae) in our own galaxy and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Highest Energy**: The highest-energy particles are thought to originate from black holes, including the supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

It is difficult to pinpoint the exact origin of [[Cosmic rays and their impact on computers | cosmic rays]] because, as charged particles, they are deflected by magnetic fields in space, causing them to wind their way through the universe for billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

One notable example of a high-energy [[Cosmic rays and their impact on computers | cosmic ray]] is the "OMG particle," detected on October 15, 1991, with an energy of 51 joulesâ€”equivalent to a single subatomic particle having the energy of a baseball traveling 100 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Interaction with Earth's Atmosphere
Primary [[Cosmic rays and their impact on computers | cosmic rays]] do not typically reach Earth's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Instead, they collide with air molecules approximately 25 kilometers above the ground, creating new particles like pions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. These new particles further collide and decay into other particles such as neutrons, protons, muons, electrons, positrons, and photons, which then continue to collide with other air molecules in a cascading "shower" towards Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Visualizing Cosmic Rays

### Cloud Chambers
In 1911, Charles Wilson perfected the cloud chamber, an enclosure containing supersaturated water or alcohol vapor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. When a [[Cosmic rays and their impact on computers | cosmic ray]] passes through, it ionizes the gas, causing vapor to condense into tiny droplets on the ions, thus revealing the particle's path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   Alpha particles (helium nuclei) leave short, thick tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   Beta particles (electrons) leave long, skinny trails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Discovery of Positron and Muon
Using a cloud chamber in 1932, Carl Anderson identified a trail that resembled an electron's but curved in the opposite direction within an applied magnetic field, implying it had a positive charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Anderson had discovered the anti-electron, or positron, the first confirmed sighting of anti-matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Four years later, also using a cloud chamber, he discovered the muon, again within [[Cosmic rays and their impact on computers | cosmic rays]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. For his discovery of the positron, Anderson received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Visualizing in Space
Astronauts in space have reported seeing flashes of light with their eyes closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. These flashes are believed to be caused by heavy particles or individual bursts of energy from radiation passing through the eyeball or optic nerve, which the body registers as a flash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

## Impact of Cosmic Rays

### On Earth
*   **Bit Flips in Computers**: [[Cosmic rays and their impact on computers | Cosmic rays]] are known to cause "bit flips" in computer memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This can lead to various errors, such as incorrect election results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, or glitches in video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. IBM estimated in 1996 that one bit flip occurs per month for every 256 megabytes of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Neutrons created in the cosmic ray particle showers are a main culprit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
    *   **Belgian Election (2003)**: A candidate, Maria Vindevogel, received 4,096 extra votes due to a bit flip in a computer's 13th bit, changing it from a zero to a one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This number, 4,096, is a power of two (2^12), which is indicative of a bit error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   **Super Mario 64 Glitch (2013)**: A speedrunner experienced an inexplicable "up warp" in the game, likely caused by a single bit flip in Mario's height coordinate, demonstrating how a change from 1 to 0 in the last bit of the height byte could instantly transport Mario to a higher platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
    *   **Blue Screen of Death**: A computer "blue screen of death" can potentially be caused by a neutron strike from a cosmic ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
    *   **Supercomputer Crashes**: Supercomputers, especially at higher elevations like Los Alamos National Labs (2200 meters above sea level), constantly deal with neutron-induced crashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### [[Effects of cosmic rays on aviation and space missions | In Aviation and Space]]
*   **Increased Radiation at Altitude**: At cruising altitude in a plane, the radiation from [[Cosmic rays and their impact on computers | cosmic rays]] increases significantly, raising the chance of a single event upset (bit flip) by 10 to 30 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
*   **Airbus A330 Incident (2008)**: An Airbus A330 experienced two sudden, uncommanded pitches downwards, injuring 119 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. Investigations concluded that a single event effect from a high-energy atmospheric particle striking an integrated circuit in the ADIRU (air data inertial reference unit) was a potential trigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Space Shuttle Redundancy**: To counter these effects, the space shuttle had four computers simultaneously running identical software for navigation and control; if one had a soft error, the other three would overrule it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. On one five-day mission (STS 48), there were 161 separate bit flips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Radiation Hardened Electronics**: For missions to other planets, protecting electronics is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. The computer on the Perseverance Rover that landed on Mars is a 20-year-old PowerPC designed to be radiation-hardened, capable of withstanding 40 times the radiation of an ordinary computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
*   **Heliosphere Protection**: The particles streaming from the sun and the solar wind maintain a protective bubble called the heliosphere, which deflects and slows [[Cosmic rays and their impact on computers | cosmic rays]] from interstellar space, protecting the solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. The sun's 11-year activity cycle causes this protection to fluctuate, meaning the flux of cosmic rays on Earth is lower when the sun is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

### On Evolution
In Earth's history, [[Cosmic rays and their impact on computers | cosmic rays]] may have played an even larger role by "flipping bits" in the genetic codes of living organisms, providing some of the variation upon which natural selection acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

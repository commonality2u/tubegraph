The presence of Bromide in water can lead to the formation of Bromate, a known carcinogen, under specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This discovery led to significant changes in water treatment and storage practices, particularly in Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Bromide: A Naturally Occurring Substance

Bromide is a substance that occurs naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> and is associated with saltwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. In areas like the California Aqueduct, which receives water from the Delta, saltwater intrusions can introduce Bromide into the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. While Bromide itself is harmless and challenging to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, its interaction with disinfectants and sunlight can create health concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Formation of Bromate

Bromate is carcinogenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, and regulations regarding its formation were put in place around the year 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. These regulations primarily focused on water treatment plants that used Ozone for disinfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

There are two primary ways Bromate has been observed to form:

*   **Ozone Disinfection**
    When Bromide in water is disinfected using Ozone, it converts into Bromate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Treatment plants using Ozone are required to monitor and control Bromate formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Initial measurements at filtration plants typically showed Bromate levels within the regulatory limit of 10 micrograms per liter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Chlorine and Sunlight**
    An "unfortunate scientific discovery" revealed that Bromide, when combined with Chlorine (used for disinfection) and exposed to bright sunlight, formed Bromate even more effectively than Ozone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This reaction was not initially part of any regulatory scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## The LA Reservoir Problem

At the LA Reservoir, water containing Bromide was disinfected with Chlorine and then stored in an open reservoir exposed to sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This combination led to Bromate levels jumping significantly upon entering the open reservoir, despite being within limits at the filtration plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Faced with Bromide in the water, necessary Chlorine disinfection, and inevitable sunlight exposure in an open reservoir, the only viable solution was to remove the sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This problem was addressed by deploying 96 million "shade balls" (originally called "bird balls") across the reservoir's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Tests showed that shade balls immediately eliminated the Bromate problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The black color of the balls is crucial for blocking all light and preventing the Bromate reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

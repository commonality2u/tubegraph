The Rubens tube is a device used to visualize [[Wave physics and properties | standing wave patterns]] in sound waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This classic physics demonstration has been taken to a new level with the creation of a two-dimensional version, known as the Pyro Board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## How a Rubens Tube Works

A traditional Rubens tube consists of a pipe with numerous small holes along its length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. A flammable gas is pumped into the pipe and then lit, creating a row of small Bunsen burners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. When sound is played into the tube, it sets up [[Wave physics and properties | standing waves]] within the air inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

These [[Wave physics and properties | standing waves]] create patterns of air vibration, with areas of significant vibration (anti-nodes) and areas of minimal vibration (nodes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The vibration of the air affects the flow rate of the gas exiting the holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, which in turn influences the height of the flames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Specifically, the flames are highest at the anti-nodes of the sound wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, allowing for a visual representation of the [[Wave physics and properties | standing wave pattern]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Pyro Board

Physics and chemistry demonstrators in Denmark have advanced the Rubens tube concept by creating a two-dimensional version called the Pyro Board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This "whole plane of Bunsen burners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> features 2,500 holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The motivation behind its creation was the belief that "when you put on more fire, then it always gets better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Demonstrating Standing Waves with the Pyro Board

The Pyro Board demonstrates [[Wave physics and properties | standing waves]] in a similar manner to the linear Rubens tube, but across a two-dimensional plane. By adjusting the frequency of the sound played into the board, distinct [[Wave physics and properties | standing wave patterns]] can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

*   **Fundamental Frequency:** The lowest frequency that produces a stable [[Wave physics and properties | standing wave]] is referred to as the fundamental frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Volume and Flame Height:** Varying the volume of the sound played into the board directly impacts the height of the flames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Auditory Experience:** The sound pressure of the [[Wave physics and properties | standing wave]] can be heard by a person moving around the board, allowing them to audibly distinguish between nodes (areas of low sound pressure) and anti-nodes (areas of high sound pressure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. The flames are highest in these audible anti-node locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Higher Frequencies:** Increasing the frequency of the sound creates more complex and intricate [[Wave physics and properties | standing wave patterns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

The Pyro Board is used by its creators to demonstrate physics concepts to children across Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

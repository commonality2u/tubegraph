Directly seeing individual atoms was once considered impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, significant breakthroughs in microscopy have made this a reality, leading to resolutions that allow us to observe atoms and their arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Challenge of Seeing Atoms
Atoms cannot be seen with visible light because their size (approximately 0.1 nanometers) is over 3,000 times smaller than the wavelength of visible light (380-750 nanometers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. When a light wavelength is much larger than the object, the light simply diffracts or bends around it, making it impossible to form an image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Electron Solution
To visualize atoms, something with a much smaller wavelength is required, and electrons proved to be the best candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### [[principles_of_electron_microscopy_and_waveparticle_duality | Wave-Particle Duality]]
In 1924, French physicist Louis de Broglie theorized that everything, not just light, exhibits wavelike properties, including matter like atoms, molecules, and even humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The wavelength of an object is calculated by Planck's constant divided by its momentum (mass times velocity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

In modern electron microscopes, electrons are accelerated to around 80% the speed of light (relativistic particles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. At this speed, their wavelength is incredibly small, between 2 to 3 picometers, which is over 100,000 times smaller than visible light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Theoretically, this allows for 100,000 times more resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## [[history_and_development_of_electron_microscopes | Early Electron Microscopes]]

### Electromagnetic Lenses
Shortly after de Broglie's discovery, German scientists began developing a microscope using high-speed electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Since glass lenses cannot bend electrons, German physicist Hans Busch suggested using an electromagnetic lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. He published his findings in 1926 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

Ernst Ruska, a PhD student, built the first prototype of an electromagnetic lens by coiling wire around iron, leaving a gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Passing current through the coil created a donut-shaped magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Electrons, boiled off a tungsten filament, were accelerated towards this lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The magnetic field exerts a Lorentz force on the electrons, causing them to spiral inwards and focus the beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### The First Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
By 1931, Ruska and his colleague Max Knoll built the first working electron microscope using this design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This basic brass instrument worked by focusing an electron beam onto an incredibly thin sample (around 100 nanometers thick) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. More electrons passed through thinner parts of the sample, creating an electron imprint, which was then magnified by a second electromagnetic lens onto a fluorescent detector to produce the final image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This was named the transmission electron microscope (TEM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Early TEMs had limited magnification, not even surpassing optical microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. However, Ruska persisted, adding more lenses to increase magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. By the mid-1930s, the TEM surpassed 10,000 times magnification, allowing close-ups of insects, bacteria, and even viruses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## The Spherical Aberration Limit

Otto Scherzer, a German physicist, published a paper in 1936 claiming that the electron microscope faced an unavoidable flaw in its electromagnetic lenses: spherical aberration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Understanding Spherical Aberration
Spherical aberration occurs because the magnetic field in an electromagnetic lens is stronger near its edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This causes electrons further from the optical axis to be over-deflected, focusing before the rays in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The result is a blurred focus spread across the optical axis instead of a single point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This blur worsens with higher magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This phenomenon affects all radially symmetric spherical lenses, including those in cameras and telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

While optical lenses can minimize spherical aberration by adding a diverging lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, this is physically impossible with magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. All magnets have two poles, and magnetic field lines always form closed loops, starting at one pole and ending at the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Due to this, electrons will always cross through two field lines, resulting in a convergence of the beam towards the axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Scherzer's paper proved that it's impossible to produce a radially symmetric magnetic lens that diverges an electron beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

This discovery created a significant roadblock for the [[history_and_development_of_electron_microscopes | development of electron microscopy]], as spherical aberration would always limit resolution, regardless of how much electrons were accelerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Alternative Atom Visualization Methods
Due to this roadblock, progress in TEM resolution slowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. By 1955, the field ion microscope took the first generally accepted images of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. It worked by shooting helium or neon atoms at a positively charged, atomically sharp needle tip. The ionized gas atoms were ejected perpendicular to the surface, forming an impression of the tip's atomic structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. However, this method was limited to the very tip of the needle, and images were not very impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, probe microscopes emerged, which could also image atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. These microscopes worked by gliding a tiny stylus across a sample, detecting variations in quantum effects or nanoscale forces to map the surface structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. They were easier to build and, because they didn't use lenses, were not limited by spherical aberration, even producing 3D images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. However, these methods were described as "feeling" atoms rather than truly "seeing" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Advancements in Electron Microscopy
Despite Scherzer's limit, work on the TEM continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### Albert Crewe's Scanning TEM (STEM)
British-American physicist Albert Crewe made significant improvements by replacing the random electron source with a more directed one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. He used a stronger electric field to pull electrons off a sharpened tungsten tip, creating a narrow beam over a thousand times brighter than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

Inspired by cathode ray tube TVs, Crewe designed a TEM that scanned its electron beam across the nanoscopic sample, mapping it bit by bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This was not the first attempt at a scanning TEM (Manfred von Ardenne built an early prototype in the 1930s, destroyed in WWII) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. However, Crewe's drastic improvements led to the first images of single atoms taken with an electron microscope by 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Even with these advancements, Scherzer's spherical aberration problem persisted, setting a hard limit on how small could be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### The Breakthrough: Aberration Correction
Scherzer's theorem states that a diverging, radially symmetric lens is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. However, if radial symmetry is abandoned, the theorem no longer applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This radical idea was pursued by Knut Urban, Max Haider, and Harold Rose, who were seen as "troublemakers" in the electron microscope community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Their unconventional approach involved purposely distorting the image with non-symmetric lenses, hoping a small part would provide the necessary divergence to correct spherical aberration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

They used a complex system of hexapole (six-coil) electromagnets, which twisted and squeezed the electron beam into a triangular saddle shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This created a slight concave bow in the middle of the image, providing a small divergence effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. By passing the beam through a second hexapole that worked in the opposite way, they could unbend the image back into a circular shape, with the remnants of that tiny divergence counteracting the spherical aberration of the original lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. This was widely considered technically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

After years of struggle and just a week before their funding ran out, Urban, Haider, and Rose successfully tested their new lens on July 24, 1997, at 2 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. The picture stabilized, revealing clear, aberration-free images of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This breakthrough cut the TEM's resolution down to an incredible 0.13 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

Initially, Urban's presentation of these results at a conference was relegated to a small room due to the group's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. However, as word spread that their pictures were real, hundreds of people lined up to see the stunningly sharp images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

## Modern Atom Visualization

Modern transmission electron microscopes require meticulous alignment to ensure the electrons transmit through the sample correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. Samples are often prepared as thin lamellae, requiring careful tilting to align atoms in a high-symmetry direction, as looking from a random direction would result in a blurred image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

Through the use of aberration correction, it is now possible to directly observe atomic structures, identify different types of atoms (e.g., strontium, titanium, oxygen, carbon contamination in strontium titanate), and measure atomic distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. The focusing process involves adjusting the lens until the edges of atomic structures become sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

Shortly after the initial breakthrough, Ondrej Krivanek independently achieved aberration correction for Crewe's scanning TEM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. In 2020, Urban, Rose, Haider, and Krivanek were awarded the prestigious Kavli Prize in Nanoscience for their achievements, which were once thought impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

### [[role_of_aberrationcorrected_microscopes_in_material_science | Role of Aberration-Corrected Microscopes]]
[[role_of_aberrationcorrected_microscopes_in_material_science | Aberration correction]] has been a "game-changer" for understanding materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. For researchers in [[role_of_aberrationcorrected_microscopes_in_material_science | material science]], materials engineering, and chemical engineering, it is essential to see what is happening at the atomic level to relate material properties to their structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Without atomic-level structural information, only half of the picture is understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. Consequently, it is now considered normal for every university to have such a microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.

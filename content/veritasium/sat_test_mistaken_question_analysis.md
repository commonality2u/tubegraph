In 1982, a single [[1982_sat_question_analysis | SAT question]] was famously answered incorrectly by every student who took the exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This incident highlighted significant [[challenges_in_standardized_testing | challenges in standardized testing]], including potential flaws in question design and the profound [[impact_of_errors_on_standardized_tests_like_the_sat | impact of errors on standardized tests like the SAT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## The Infamous Question

The question, labeled number 17, presented a geometric problem:
<blockquote>"In the figure above, the radius of circle A is 1/3 the radius of circle B. Starting from the position shown in the figure, circle A rolls around circle B. At the end of how many revolutions of circle A will the center of the circle first reach its starting point." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a></blockquote>
Students were typically given about a minute per problem on the SAT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The options provided were A) 3/2, B) three, C) six, D) 9/2, or E) nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Initial Misconception

Most people, including the test writers themselves, intuitively chose "three" as the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This reasoning stemmed from the understanding that if the radius of circle B is three times that of circle A, then its circumference (2πr) would also be three times larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Therefore, it seemed logical that circle A would take three full rotations to roll around circle B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, this common assumption was incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## The Error Revealed

The reason no one answered question 17 correctly was that the test writers had made a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>; the actual correct answer was not among the listed options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Despite the SAT's reputation for determining people's futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, only three of 300,000 test takers — Shivan Kartha, Bruce Taub, and Doug Jungreis — wrote to the College Board (the SAT administrator) to report the error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. These students, who were experienced in math competitions, were confident that none of the answers were correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. The College Board eventually admitted their mistake and nullified the question for all test takers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## The Coin Rotation Paradox

The underlying principle at play in this question is known as the **coin rotation paradox** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
A simple demonstration involves two identical coins:
1.  Intuitively, if one coin rolls around another of the exact same circumference, it should rotate exactly once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
2.  However, when performed, the coin completes one full rotation by the halfway point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
3.  By the time it returns to its starting point, it has rotated *twice* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

This paradox applies directly to the [[1982_sat_question_analysis | SAT question]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Using a to-scale model of the problem (a useful tip for [[sat_problemsolving_strategies | standardized tests]] is that images are almost always to scale, despite disclaimers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>), circle A (1/3 radius of B) rotates four times as it rolls around circle B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The correct answer is four, which was not an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

The paradox occurs because Circle A is not only rolling along the circumference of Circle B but is also itself orbiting around Circle B's center. This orbiting motion contributes an additional rotation.
The general solution for a circle rolling around another circle is to calculate the ratio between the circumferences of the outer and inner circles and then add one rotation to account for the circular path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Alternative Perspectives & Ambiguity

The question's wording also introduced ambiguity, leading to other possible, yet unintended, solutions:

*   **Perspective of Circle B:** If one considers the rotations from the perspective of Circle B looking out at Circle A, Circle A rotates only three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This is analogous to unwrapping the larger circle's circumference into a straight line, where Circle A would indeed roll three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Astronomical Definition of Revolution:** If "revolutions" is interpreted in its precise astronomical sense (a complete orbit around another body), Circle A only *revolves* around Circle B once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This highlights the extreme ambiguity of the question's phrasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## The General Principle and Proof

Mathematician Doug Jungreis explained the mathematical principle behind the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The amount a small circle rotates while rolling without slipping is always equal to the distance its center travels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

This general principle extends to any surface:
*   **Rolling on the outside of a shape:** The distance traveled by the center of the rolling circle is the perimeter of the shape *plus* the rolling circle's circumference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Dividing this by the rolling circle's circumference yields N+1 rotations (where N is the ratio of circumferences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Rolling on the inside of a shape:** The distance traveled by the center *decreases* by one circumference, resulting in N-1 rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Rolling along a flat line:** The distance traveled by the center equals the length of the line, resulting in N rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Real-World Application: Sidereal vs. Solar Time

This mathematical principle has profound real-world applications, particularly in astronomy, for accurate timekeeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

*   **Solar Day/Year:** When we count 365.24 days in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, we are counting "solar days"—the time it takes for the Sun to be directly overhead again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Because Earth is also orbiting the Sun, it has to rotate more than 360 degrees to bring the Sun back to the same position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Sidereal Day/Year:** To an external observer (e.g., looking at distant stars), the Earth performs one extra rotation due to its circular path around the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This means they count 366.24 days in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This is called a Sidereal year, where "Sidereal" means "with respect to the stars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
    *   A Sidereal day is shorter than a solar day, lasting 23 hours, 56 minutes, and four seconds, as Earth only needs to rotate exactly 360 degrees to see a distant star directly overhead again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

While solar time is practical for daily life on Earth (otherwise day and night would completely swap over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>), astronomers use Sidereal time for telescopes and geostationary satellites to maintain consistent observation points in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Thus, the coin paradox explains the fundamental difference between how we track time on Earth and in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## Consequences and Broader Context

The nullification and rescoring of the 1982 [[1982_sat_question_analysis | SAT]] question came at a cost.
*   It shifted students' final scores by up to 10 points out of 800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. While seemingly small, these points could significantly [[impact_of_errors_on_standardized_tests_like_the_sat | impact educational opportunities]] due to strict cutoff scores for universities and scholarships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   The rescoring process cost the testing service over $100,000, money derived from test takers' fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

This incident is one example of [[common_errors_in_geometry_questions | common errors in geometry questions]] and broader [[challenges_in_standardized_testing | challenges in standardized testing]]. In recent years, the prominence of the SAT has declined; after COVID-19, nearly 80% of undergraduate colleges in the U.S. no longer require standardized testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This represents a significant shift in [[changes_in_standardized_testing_requirements_after_COVID_19 | standardized testing requirements after COVID-19]].

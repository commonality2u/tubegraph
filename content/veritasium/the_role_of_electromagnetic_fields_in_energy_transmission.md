The common understanding of how electrical energy travels from a power source to a device often involves electrons moving through wires. However, this widely held belief contains significant [[misconceptions_about_electricity | misconceptions about electricity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Electrical energy is not primarily carried by electrons flowing through wires, but rather by [[Poynting vector and energy flow | electromagnetic fields]] existing in the space surrounding the conductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Historical Breakthrough: Maxwell and Poynting

A crucial breakthrough in understanding energy transmission occurred in the 1860s and 70s with James Clerk Maxwell, who realized that light consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. These fields oscillate perpendicular to each other and in phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Maxwell's equations describe the behavior of these fields and waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

In 1883, John Henry Poynting, a former student of Maxwell, developed an equation to describe energy flux—how much [[Poynting vector and energy flow | electromagnetic energy]] passes through an area per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This is known as the [[Poynting vector and energy flow | Poynting vector]], symbolized as S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The formula is S = (1/μ₀) * (E x B), where μ₀ is the permeability of free space, E is the electric field, and B is the magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The cross product (E x B) indicates that the energy flows perpendicular to both the electric and magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This concept initially explained how light carries energy from the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Importantly, Poynting's equation applies whenever electric and magnetic fields coincide, describing the flow of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Energy Flow in a DC Circuit

Consider a simple circuit with a battery and a light bulb:
*   A battery alone has an electric field but no magnetic field, so it doesn't lose energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   When connected, the battery's electric field extends through the circuit at the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   This electric field causes electrons to accumulate or deplete on conductor surfaces, creating surface charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   These surface charges generate a small electric field inside the wires, leading to a slow drift of electrons (current) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The drift velocity is extremely slow, about a tenth of a millimeter per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   The surface charges also create an electric field outside the wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   The current inside the wires generates a magnetic field outside the wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   The combination of these electric and magnetic fields in the space around the circuit results in a flow of energy, as described by the [[Poynting vector and energy flow | Poynting vector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

Using the right-hand rule, it's evident that energy flows radially outwards from the battery into the fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Along the wires, energy flows in the direction of the current (to the right in the example) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. At the light bulb's filament, the [[Poynting vector and energy flow | Poynting vector]] is directed inwards, indicating that the bulb receives energy from the surrounding fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This demonstrates that energy is transmitted by the electric and magnetic fields, not directly by the electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Even though electrons may move back and forth, the [[Poynting vector and energy flow | energy flux]] flows in one direction: from the source to the load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## AC Circuits and Power Grids

The same analysis applies to alternating current (AC) sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. While the direction of current and thus the electric and magnetic fields flip every half cycle, their combined effect (the cross product) ensures the [[Poynting vector and energy flow | Poynting vector]] still points in the same direction: from the source to the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This explains how energy flows from power plants to homes through power lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Electrons in power lines merely oscillate back and forth; they do not carry the energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Instead, oscillating electric and magnetic fields travel from the power station to the home, delivering the power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Real-World Validation: The Transatlantic Cable

The practical importance of this understanding was highlighted by the challenges faced during the laying of the first Transatlantic telegraph cable in 1858 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Signals sent over the long undersea distance became distorted and lengthened, making it difficult to differentiate messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
A debate ensued: William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) believed signals moved like water through a tube, while others like Heaviside and Fitzgerald correctly argued that the [[Poynting vector and energy flow | fields]] around the wires carried the energy and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
The problem stemmed from the cable's construction: a central copper conductor coated in an insulator and encased in an iron sheath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Although the iron was meant for strength, as a good conductor, it interfered with the propagation of [[electromagnetic_waves_and_the_role_of_radio_waves_in_imaging | electromagnetic fields]] by increasing the line's capacitance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This is why modern power lines are suspended high up, maintaining a large insulating gap of air from the ground to prevent interference from the conductive earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## The Giant Circuit Problem Revisited

Considering the initial thought experiment of a giant circuit with wires 300,000 kilometers long and a light bulb one meter away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>: the light bulb would turn on almost instantaneously, in roughly 1/c seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This is because the limiting factor is not the travel time of an electric field along the entire length of the wire, but rather the propagation of the electric and magnetic fields through the space around the wires to the bulb, which is only one meter away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This takes mere nanoseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

This understanding of energy transmission via traveling [[electromagnetic_waves_and_the_role_of_radio_waves_in_imaging | electromagnetic waves]] around power lines is a fundamental aspect of how electricity works, yet it is rarely understood by the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

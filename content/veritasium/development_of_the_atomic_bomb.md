The atomic bomb, a device that forever changed the course of history, was developed by a team of scientists under the leadership of [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | J. Robert Oppenheimer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Its creation also introduced a way for humanity to destroy itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Early Concepts of Nuclear Energy

Before the atomic bomb's development, it was widely believed that extracting significant energy from radioactive atoms was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Radioactivity, discovered by Henri Becquerel, Marie Curie, and Pierre Curie in the late 1890s, was understood as a passive process where unstable atoms decayed randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

In 1933, Ernest Rutherford, a physicist from Cambridge, stated that "Anyone who expects a source of power from the transformations of these atoms is talking moonshine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Albert Einstein echoed this sentiment the same year, saying, "That there is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable. It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Shattering the Nucleus

One method to break an atomic nucleus involved accelerating a proton through a large electric field and smashing it into a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton successfully did this in 1932, accelerating protons into lithium nuclei, breaking them apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. However, this method was inefficient due to the positive charge of protons being repelled by nuclei, requiring 250,000 volts and resulting in only about one in a billion protons splitting a nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

A more effective method emerged with the discovery of the neutron in 1932 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Neutrons, being uncharged, are not repelled by atomic nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. In 1933, Leo Szilard conceived of using neutrons to split nuclei, postulating that if an element could be split by neutrons and emit more neutrons upon absorption, it could sustain a nuclear chain reaction if a sufficiently large mass was assembled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Discovery of Fission and Chain Reaction Concept

On January 29, 1939, physicist Luis Alvarez read an article detailing how German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann successfully split an atom of uranium by bombarding it with neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Initially, [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] was skeptical, mathematically "proving" fission impossible on his blackboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. However, after Alvarez replicated the experiment the next day, [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] quickly grasped its implications, speculating that the process would release extra neutrons that could split more uranium atoms, generating power or bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

When a single atom of uranium-235 splits, it loses a small amount of mass, released as energy, consistent with Einstein's mass-energy equivalence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. While the energy from one atom is tiny, the sheer number of atoms in a kilogram of uranium (about a trillion trillion) means the energy quickly accumulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

By August 1939, the potential of nuclear weapons was widely recognized. Einstein, who had previously believed them impossible, signed a letter (written by Szilard) to President Franklin Roosevelt, warning about the possibility of nuclear weapons and Germany's access to uranium from Czechoslovakia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This led to the formation of an informal uranium committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## The [[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | Manhattan Project]]

In 1941, Roosevelt upgraded the informal uranium committee to the S-1 committee, with the explicit goal of developing an atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. In May 1942, [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] was hired as the coordinator of rapid rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. On September 18, 1942, General Leslie Groves was put in charge of the [[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | Manhattan Project]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

Groves quickly ordered 1200 tons of uranium ore and acquired the Oak Ridge site for refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. In a surprising move, he chose [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] as the scientific director of the soon-to-be-established [[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | Los Alamos Laboratory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Despite concerns about [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]]'s lack of a Nobel Prize, administrative experience, impracticality as a theoretical physicist, and links to the Communist Party, Groves was impressed by his ambition and ability to understand problems across physics, chemistry, engineering, and metallurgy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Groves believed [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] was a "real genius" who could build the atomic bomb before the Nazis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

[[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] proposed Los Alamos, New Mexico, as the isolated site for the laboratory, having a personal fondness for the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Initially, [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] underestimated the scale, predicting six scientists and a handful of engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. However, 764 scientists (302 at Los Alamos) and over 600,000 people in total were involved in the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### Achieving a Chain Reaction

On December 2, 1942, Enrico Fermi's team at the University of Chicago created the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, Chicago Pile-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Located under a football field's stands, it consisted of 45 tons of uranium and uranium oxide and 330 tons of graphite blocks, generating about half a watt of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. The successful operation of a nuclear power plant demonstrated the feasibility of a bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

The key difference between a reactor and a bomb is the multiplication factor (K):
*   If K=1, a stable, self-sustaining chain reaction occurs.
*   If K<1, the reaction dies down.
*   If K>1, the reaction grows, leading to an explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

## Atomic Bomb Designs

The simplest way to make a nuclear bomb is to assemble enough fissile material to create a runaway chain reaction, known as the critical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
*   **Uranium-235 (U235)**: Requires about 52 kilograms, forming a sphere 17 cm in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Naturally occurring uranium is only about 0.7% U235, requiring gigantic mass spectrometers for enrichment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. When U235 absorbs a neutron, it briefly becomes U236 before splitting and releasing 2.4 neutrons per fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   **Plutonium-239 (Pu239)**: Has a smaller critical mass of around 10 kilograms (10 cm sphere) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Pu239 was synthesized in early 1941 when U238 absorbs a neutron, turning into unstable U239, which decays into Neptunium, and then Plutonium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. It is cheaper to make than separating U235 but reacts too quickly for a gun-type device, leading to a fizzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

### Gun-Type Design (Little Boy)

This design uses two sub-critical slabs of uranium-235 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. A conventional explosive, like cordite, rapidly fires one slab (the "bullet") towards the other, combining their mass to exceed the critical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. The nuclear chain reaction begins when the bullet is about 25 centimeters away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. This design is less efficient, with only a small percentage of uranium undergoing fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. An unexpected logistical challenge was finding a lubricant for the uranium bullet; only sperm whale oil worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

### Implosion Design (Fat Man, The Gadget)

This design relies on the principle that critical mass decreases with increased material density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. By compressing plutonium-239 with conventional explosives, its density increases, lowering its critical mass and initiating a nuclear chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
*   **Neutron Reflector**: Surrounding the sphere with a material that reflects neutrons decreases the required nuclear fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **Neutron Source (Urchin)**: To kickstart the chain reaction, a tiny 7-gram pellet called the "urchin" was developed for the first implosion bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. Made of beryllium and polonium separated by nickel and gold, the shockwave from the explosives would mix the beryllium and polonium, causing alpha particles from polonium to release a flood of neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## The Trinity Test

The Trinity test, the codename for the first nuclear bomb detonation, was scheduled for July 16, 1945, to precede the Potsdam Conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] was nervous due to a previous test failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

### Atmospheric Ignition Fears

A terrifying possibility discussed by [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] and Arthur Compton around 1942 was that a nuclear test could ignite the Earth's atmosphere, ending all life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. The concern was that the extreme temperatures of the bomb would cause hydrogen gas (a tiny fraction of the atmosphere) to fuse, releasing energy that would fuse more hydrogen, and even break apart hydrogen from water vapor to cause further fusion, turning the entire atmosphere into a giant fusion bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Compton recalled [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]]'s fear that nitrogen in the air, also unstable, might be set off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. Most scientists quickly realized this scenario was unlikely and proceeded with the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

### Detonation and Aftermath

Delayed by a storm, "the gadget," the world's first nuclear bomb, detonated at 5:29:21 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. The high explosives compressed the plutonium core, and the shockwave mixed the beryllium and polonium in the urchin, releasing neutrons that successfully jump-started the nuclear reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

The explosion, from just six kilograms of plutonium, was equivalent to nearly 25,000 tons of TNT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. The New Mexico mountains were illuminated brighter than daytime, the shockwave was felt over 160 kilometers away, and the mushroom cloud rose 12 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. The desert sand melted into a glassy mineral known as trinitite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. Fortunately, the blast did not ignite the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

## Use of Atomic Bombs in World War II

On August 6, 1945, the Boeing B-29 Flying Fortress dropped "Little Boy," a gun-type nuclear bomb containing 64 kilograms of enriched uranium, on Hiroshima <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. The nitrocellulose ignited, pushing uranium-235 slugs together to exceed critical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. The explosion, equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT, killed nearly 70,000 people immediately, with another 70,000 dying from burns and radiation poisoning in the following months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

Three days later, an implosion-type bomb, similar to "the gadget," was dropped on Nagasaki, killing an estimated 80,000 more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. Over 95% of the 225,000 people killed in the bombings of [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Hiroshima]] and Nagasaki were civilians, mostly women and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

In 1965, recalling the Trinity test, [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] quoted from the Bhagavad Gita:
> "Now I am become death the destroyer of worlds." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>

## Post-War Developments and Concerns

After the war, [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] became a national hero and was appointed director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. He also chaired the General Advisory Committee, advising on nuclear weapons issues and advocating for [[historical_context_of_world_war_ii_and_nuclear_arms_race | arms control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

In August 1949, the Soviet Union tested its first atomic weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. This led the US military to develop a more powerful weapon: the hydrogen bomb, also known as "The Super" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] opposed its development on ethical grounds and the fear of starting an [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cold_war_strategies | arms race]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. Despite his opposition, the Truman administration proceeded, and three years later, "Ivy Mike," the first hydrogen bomb, was tested in the Marshall Islands, with a yield of 10.4 megatons of TNT, 400 times more powerful than the Trinity test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

A hydrogen bomb is effectively three bombs in one: a conventional bomb, a fission bomb, and a fusion bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. Conventional explosives trigger a fission reaction, which then creates enough temperature and pressure to fuse deuterium and tritium, releasing immense energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. In 1961, the Soviet Union tested the Tsar Bomba, the most powerful explosion ever detonated, five times more powerful than Ivy Mike and around 2000 times more powerful than Trinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. This kind of [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cold_war_strategies | arms race]] was exactly what [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] had feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

### Ethical and Political Aftermath

[[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]]'s opposition to the hydrogen bomb and his calls to avert an [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cold_war_strategies | arms race]] led to a trial to revoke his security clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. He had been surveilled since the [[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | Manhattan Project]], with many wiretaps being illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. He was questioned about ties to the Communist Party, including an affair with a party member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. In December 1953, his security clearance was suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

[[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] maintained that the use of the weapon was complex:
> "At the time, the alternative, the campaign of invasion was certainly much more terrible for everyone concerned. I think that [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Hiroshima]] was far more costly in life and suffering inhumane than it needed to have been, to have been an effective argument for ending the war. This is easy to say after the fact." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>

He believed that talks to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons "should have been done the day after Trinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] died on February 18, 1967, at age 62, from throat cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.

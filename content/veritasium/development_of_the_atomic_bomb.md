The development of the atomic bomb, a weapon that forever changed the course of history, was led by [[j_robert_oppenheimer_and_the_manhattan_project | J. Robert Oppenheimer]], who, despite never winning a Nobel Prize, significantly impacted the world [00:00:01]. This development has affected every war waged and every peace settled since the end of World War II [00:00:27].

## Early Scientific Pursuits of J. Robert Oppenheimer

At 21, [[j_robert_oppenheimer_and_the_manhattan_project | J. Robert Oppenheimer]] faced academic challenges at Cambridge, placing an apple laced with toxic chemicals on his physics tutor Patrick Blackett's desk [00:01:01]. Oppenheimer was reportedly clumsy and not adept at experimental work, which his tutor, an experimentalist, often hounded him to do [00:01:11]. He spent time in J.J. Thompson's basement laboratory attempting to make thin films of beryllium for studying electrons [00:01:21]. By 1925, he was deeply unhappy, finding laboratory work boring and feeling he was learning nothing [00:01:52]. During this period of emotional anguish, he attempted to poison Blackett, a story Oppenheimer himself confirmed [00:02:10]. His family's wealth prevented criminal charges or expulsion from Cambridge, provided he attended periodic counseling sessions [00:02:48].

In 1926, Oppenheimer moved to the University of Göttingen, where he thrived under Max Born, who had coined the term "[[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | Quantum Mechanics]]" [00:03:01]. Surrounded by luminaries like Paul Dirac and John Von Neumann, Oppenheimer's mental health improved as he immersed himself in theoretical physics [00:03:28]. He graduated with a PhD in physics at 23, having written his thesis in German and published over a dozen papers, many expanding on the work of Werner Heisenberg [00:04:13]. Oppenheimer and Heisenberg met in 1927, the same year Heisenberg published his groundbreaking paper on the Quantum uncertainty principle [00:04:33]. Unbeknownst to them, they would become rivals 15 years later, working to build the first nuclear bomb for the USA and Nazi Germany, respectively [00:04:44].

## The Road to Fission

For decades, getting significant energy from radioactive atoms was considered impossible, with figures like Ernest Rutherford [00:05:23] and Albert Einstein [00:05:34] dismissing the idea of controllable nuclear energy. However, in 1932, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton successfully split lithium nuclei by accelerating protons into them, earning them a Nobel Prize [00:05:56]. The challenge remained that positively charged protons were repelled by atomic nuclei, requiring immense voltage to overcome this barrier [00:06:08].

The discovery of the neutron in 1932, a subatomic particle with no electric charge, presented a new possibility [00:06:39]. By 1933, Leo Szilard conceived of a nuclear chain reaction: if an element could be split by neutrons and emit two neutrons when it absorbed one, a sufficiently large mass could sustain such a reaction [00:06:55].

On January 29, 1939, physicist Luis Alvarez informed Oppenheimer that German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann had successfully split a uranium atom by bombarding it with neutrons [00:07:24]. Initially skeptical, Oppenheimer was convinced after Alvarez repeated the experiment the next day, realizing that extra neutrons could "boil off" to split more uranium atoms, generating power or making bombs [00:08:00].

When a uranium-235 atom splits, it releases a tiny but significant amount of energy, which accumulates rapidly given the vast number of atoms in a kilogram of uranium [00:08:23]. By August 1939, Albert Einstein, despite his earlier skepticism, signed a letter penned by Szilard to President Franklin Roosevelt, warning of the potential for nuclear weapons and Germany's access to uranium [00:08:53]. This led to the formation of an informal uranium committee, which was later upgraded to the S-1 committee in 1941, with the explicit goal of developing an atomic bomb [00:09:19].

## The [[j_robert_oppenheimer_and_the_manhattan_project | Manhattan Project]]

In May 1942, [[j_robert_oppenheimer_and_the_manhattan_project | Oppenheimer]] was hired as the coordinator of rapid rupture for the S-1 committee [00:09:42]. After completing his PhD, Oppenheimer had become a physics professor at UC Berkeley and Caltech, making significant contributions across various fields and developing Nobel Prize-winning ideas [00:09:56]. Although he was nominated three times, he never won the Nobel Prize, with some colleagues noting his lack of "Sitzfleisch" (patience for long calculations) and tendency for computational errors [00:10:33]. However, his charisma and ability to generate great ideas made him an ideal leader [00:11:06].

On September 18, 1942, General Leslie Groves was put in charge of the [[j_robert_oppenheimer_and_the_manhattan_project | Manhattan Project]] [00:11:23]. Groves quickly moved to secure uranium ore and the Oak Ridge site for refinement [00:11:31]. Groves chose Oppenheimer as the science director for the Los Alamos laboratory, a surprising move given Oppenheimer's lack of a Nobel Prize, administrative experience, and links to the Communist Party [00:11:41]. Groves, however, was impressed by Oppenheimer's ambition and ability to understand problems across physics, chemistry, engineering, and metallurgy, viewing him as a "real genius" [00:12:31].

Oppenheimer proposed Los Alamos, New Mexico, as the project's isolated location, a place he loved for its harsh desert and mountains [00:13:44]. While he initially underestimated the scale, the project grew to involve 764 scientists at Los Alamos and over 600,000 people in total [00:14:07].

### Nuclear Fission and Bomb Designs

On December 2, 1942, Enrico Fermi's team at the University of Chicago created the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, Pile-1, a stable self-sustaining chain reaction [00:14:47]. The key to making a bomb is achieving a multiplication factor (K) greater than one, where, on average, more than one neutron hits the next atom, causing it to split and release more neutrons [00:15:20].

The simplest bomb design involves getting enough fissile material close together to create a runaway chain reaction, known as the critical mass [00:15:48]. For Uranium-235, the critical mass is about 52 kilograms [00:15:58].

The first bomb design considered was the **gun-type bomb** [00:16:17]. This design uses conventional explosives like cordite to rapidly fire one slab of uranium-235 into another, combining them to exceed the critical mass and initiate an explosion [00:16:20]. This design, though simple, is inefficient, and required unexpected solutions, such as using sperm whale oil to lubricate the uranium barrel to ensure smooth sliding [00:16:49]. Naturally occurring uranium is only about 0.7% U235, requiring gigantic mass spectrometers to enrich the fuel [00:17:20].

Another option emerged in 1941 with the synthesis of **plutonium-239** [00:18:06]. Plutonium is created when uranium-238 absorbs a neutron, becoming uranium-239, which decays into neptunium, then plutonium [00:18:12]. Plutonium-239 is an excellent bomb fuel with a critical mass of only about 10 kilograms, and is cheaper to produce than enriched uranium [00:18:28]. However, it reacts too quickly for a gun-type device, leading to fizzling [00:18:39].

This led to the **implosion bomb design** [00:19:22]. Critical mass changes with material density [00:18:51]. By compressing a sub-critical mass of plutonium with conventional explosives, its density increases, lowering its critical mass and starting a nuclear chain reaction [00:19:02]. This design can be enhanced by surrounding the sphere with neutron-reflecting material to decrease the required fuel [00:19:33]. Additionally, a neutron source, like the "urchin" device made of beryllium and polonium, could kickstart the reaction [00:19:41]. When detonated, the shockwave would mix the beryllium and polonium, causing the beryllium to release neutrons that would set off the chain reaction [00:20:02].

## The Trinity Test and its Aftermath

The Trinity test, the world's first nuclear bomb detonation, was scheduled for July 16, 1945, just one day before the Potsdam conference [00:20:31]. Oppenheimer was nervous, reciting a stanza from the Bhagavad Gita [00:21:09].

A terrifying possibility discussed by Oppenheimer and Arthur Compton around 1942 was that a nuclear test could ignite the Earth's atmosphere [00:21:50]. The concern was that the bomb's extreme temperatures could cause hydrogen gas or even nitrogen in the air to undergo fusion, leading to a runaway global fusion reaction [00:22:08]. Most scientists quickly realized this scenario was unlikely, but the idea of starting a fusion reaction with a fission weapon remained significant for future weapon development [00:22:57].

At 5:29:21 AM on July 16, 1945, the "gadget"—the implosion bomb—detonated [00:23:23]. The high explosive squeezed the plutonium core, mixing the beryllium and polonium in the urchin, releasing a flood of neutrons that jump-started the nuclear reaction [00:23:30]. Just six kilograms of plutonium created an explosion equivalent to nearly 25,000 tons of TNT, illuminating the New Mexico mountains brighter than daytime [00:23:47]. The shockwave was felt over 160 kilometers away, and the mushroom cloud rose 12 kilometers high [00:23:59]. The intense heat melted desert sand into a glassy mineral known as trinitite [00:24:09]. Fortunately, the atmosphere did not ignite [00:24:15].

On August 6, 1945, the "Little Boy" gun-type nuclear bomb, containing 64 kilograms of enriched uranium, was dropped on Hiroshima, killing nearly 70,000 people instantly, with another 70,000 dying from burns and radiation poisoning in subsequent months [00:24:24]. Three days later, an implosion-type bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, killing an estimated 80,000 more people [00:24:57]. Over 95% of the 225,000 people killed in both bombings were civilians, mostly women and children [00:25:07].

Recalling the Trinity test in 1965, Oppenheimer famously quoted from the Bhagavad Gita: "Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds" [00:25:21].

## [[postwar_legacy_of_oppenheimer_and_nuclear_arms_race | Postwar Legacy]] and [[ethical_implications_of_nuclear_weapons | Ethical Implications]]

After the war, Oppenheimer became a national hero, appearing on the cover of Time Magazine [00:26:24]. He became the director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton in 1947 and chaired the General Advisory Committee, advising on nuclear weapons issues and advocating for [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cooperation | arms control]] [00:26:32].

In August 1949, the Soviet Union tested its first atomic weapon [00:26:51]. This led the US military to develop a more powerful bomb, the hydrogen bomb, known as "The Super" [00:27:00]. Oppenheimer opposed its development on [[ethical_implications_of_nuclear_weapons | ethical grounds]] and due to concerns about starting an [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cooperation | arms race]] [00:27:10]. Despite his opposition, the Truman administration proceeded, and "Ivy Mike," the first hydrogen bomb, was tested in the Marshall Islands in 1952, yielding 10.4 megatons of TNT—400 times more powerful than the Trinity test [00:27:18]. A hydrogen bomb is effectively three bombs in one: a conventional bomb triggers a fission bomb, which then generates enough heat and pressure to fuse deuterium and tritium, releasing immense energy [00:27:40]. In 1961, the Soviet Union tested the "Tsar Bomba," the most powerful explosion ever detonated, five times more powerful than Ivy Mike and around 2000 times more powerful than Trinity [00:28:00].

This [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cooperation | arms race]] was exactly what Oppenheimer had feared [00:28:17]. In part due to his [[oppenheimers_opposition_to_the_hydrogen_bomb | opposition to the hydrogen bomb]] and calls to avert a [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cooperation | nuclear arms race]], his security clearance was revoked [00:28:21]. He was surveilled, questioned about ties to the Communist Party, and accused of treason and espionage [00:28:30]. In December 1953, his security clearance was suspended, making international news [00:28:54].

When German playwright Heinar Kipphardt wrote a play about Oppenheimer's life in 1964, Oppenheimer hated it, especially a scene where his character realized the "evil of his work," stating that it was "always more complicated than that" [00:29:13]. He believed the atomic bomb was a necessary part of ending World War II, arguing that an invasion campaign would have been "much more terrible" [00:29:37]. However, he also felt that Hiroshima was "far more costly in life and suffering inhumane than it needed to have been" [00:30:13]. In 1965, he stated that talks with the Soviet Union to halt nuclear weapon proliferation "should have been done the day after Trinity" [00:30:36].

Oppenheimer, a lifelong smoker, was diagnosed with throat cancer and died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62 [00:30:50].

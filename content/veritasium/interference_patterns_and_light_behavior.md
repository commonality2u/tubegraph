The fundamental question, "What is light?", has puzzled scientists for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Historically, the greatest minds in science debated this very issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Initial public perception of light often focuses on its observable qualities, such as brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, its ability to illuminate a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, and its different colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Historical Debate on the Nature of Light
The [[historical_debate_on_the_nature_of_light | nature of light]] was a hotly contested topic. In the late 1600s, Isaac Newton, in his treatise *Opticks*, proposed that light was a stream of [[nature_of_light_particles_versus_waves | particles]] or corpuscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. However, at the same time, Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens argued that light behaved as a [[nature_of_light_particles_versus_waves | wave]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This debate persisted for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Young's Double Slit Experiment

The long-standing debate was eventually settled by Thomas Young's double slit experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. To ensure accuracy in recreating this experiment, the original source material was consulted: Thomas Young's handwritten notes from 1803, found in the vault beneath the Royal Society in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Young's original notes described the setup and observation:
> "I brought into the sunbeam a slip of card, about one-thirtieth of an inch in breadth, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> and observed its shadow, either on the wall or on other cards held at different distances. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> Besides the fringes of color on each side of the shadow, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> the shadow itself was divided by similar parallel fringes, of smaller dimensions." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

This experiment is simple enough to perform at home, though it is "fiddly" to achieve with sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Experiment Setup and Observations
A recreation of the experiment involved an empty box with a small eyepiece and a hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. A slide containing two very narrow, side-by-side openings—a "double slit"—was placed over the hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The box was then tilted towards the sun so that sunlight hit the double slit directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

Before looking, people commonly predicted seeing two distinct lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, or perhaps even one line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. However, the actual observation was surprising:
> "I see dots." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
> "Oh, there's one.. there's one in the middle, the strongest, two either side." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
> "The two on the outside are multicolored, and the one in the middle... is just white." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
> "It looks kind of a rainbow." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
> "Quite a few colors and lots of little dots." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>
> "And there are more dots appearing...spreading along." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>

This unexpected pattern left observers "really confused" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Explaining the Phenomenon: Wave Interference

The observed pattern makes no sense if light behaves solely as [[nature_of_light_particles_versus_waves | particles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. If light were particles, passing through two slits would simply produce two bright spots underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

However, if light behaves as [[nature_of_light_particles_versus_waves | waves]], then the waves from each slit can interact with one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This phenomenon can be demonstrated with water waves:
*   A single source of ripples creates circular wavefronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   Adding a second source of ripples, similar to the two slits, creates an interesting pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This pattern is formed by the ripples interacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

This interaction leads to two types of interference:
*   **Constructive Interference**: Where wave peaks meet peaks, and troughs meet troughs, the amplitude of the wave increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Destructive Interference**: If a peak from one wave meets a trough from another, they cancel each other out, resulting in no wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This is analogous to "light canceling itself out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

This is precisely what occurs with light in the double slit experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>:
*   When light waves from the two slits constructively interfere (peaks with peaks, troughs with troughs), they produce a bright spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   When light waves destructively interfere (trough from one meets peak from the other), no light is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

The result is a series of bright and dark spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Wavelengths and Color Differences
A slight complication arises because sunlight is composed of many different colors, and each color has a different wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Because of their different wavelengths, colors will constructively interfere at slightly different points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This phenomenon explains the "rainbowing effects" observed further from the central bright spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. For example, red light will meet up at different places than blue light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Therefore, the [[interaction_of_light_with_different_wavelengths_causing_color_differences | difference between blue light and red light]], or any colors, is their wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Our perception of color is fundamentally linked to these different wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Unanswered Question
It was noted that the light pattern observed at the bottom of the box appeared as "kind of round blobs" rather than defined slits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The reason for this specific shape remains an open question for further consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Conclusion
The compelling results of Young's double slit experiment led the scientific community to conclude that light must behave as a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

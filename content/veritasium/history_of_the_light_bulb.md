The world's longest continuously operating light bulb is located at Livermore Fire Station number six, where it has been on for 120 years since 1901 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This bulb, manufactured by hand shortly after commercial light bulbs were first invented, has run for over a million hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, significantly longer than modern light bulbs are designed to last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. While a common anecdote suggests an "everlasting light bulb" was never sold due to a poor business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, evidence suggests that light bulbs were indeed intentionally made worse over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Early Development of Electric Light

Inventing a viable electric light was a challenging endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The typical incandescent design involves passing electric current through a material until it glows from heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Less than 5% of the electrical energy in these bulbs is converted to light, with the remaining 95% released as heat, essentially making them "heat bulbs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The filament temperature can reach up to 2,800 Kelvin, half as hot as the surface of the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. At such temperatures, most materials melt or burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Key milestones in early light bulb development include:
*   **1840s:** Warren De la Rue proposed placing the filament in a vacuum bulb to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **1879:** Thomas Edison developed a bulb with a cotton thread filament that lasted 14 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Late 19th - Early 20th Century:** Other inventors experimented with platinum filaments or carbonized materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Filaments eventually transitioned from carbon to tungsten, known for its high melting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Early 1920s:** Average bulb lifetimes approached 2,000 hours, with some lasting up to 2,500 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## The [[phoebus_cartel_and_its_impact_on_light_bulbs | Phoebus Cartel]] and Planned Obsolescence

Around the early 1920s, the lifespan of light bulbs ceased to increase and began to shorten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Just before Christmas in 1924, a secret meeting took place in Geneva, Switzerland, involving top executives from major light bulb companies such as Phillips, International General Electric, Tokyo Electric, OSRAM, and Associated Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They formed the [[phoebus_cartel_and_its_impact_on_light_bulbs | Phoebus Cartel]], named after the Greek God of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Formation and Goals

The cartel aimed to control the global supply of light bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. By this time, the industry had largely consolidated into a few dominant corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The primary threat to their business was the increasing longevity of light bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. For example, OSRAM's sales dropped significantly from 63 million bulbs in 1923 to 28 million in 1924 because bulbs were lasting too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

To counter this, the cartel members agreed to reduce the lifespan of their bulbs to 1,000 hours, nearly halving the existing average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Enforcement and Impact

To ensure compliance, manufacturers had to submit sample bulbs for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Companies were fined if their bulbs lasted significantly longer than 1,000 hours, with a fine of 200 Swiss Francs per 1,000 bulbs for lifespans over 3,000 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Records confirm these fines were issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

Engineers, who previously worked to extend bulb lifespan, were now tasked with decreasing it through modifications to materials, filament shapes, and thinner connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This effort was successful; the average lifespan steadily decreased after the cartel's formation, reaching just 1,205 hours by 1934 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. As planned, sales for cartel members increased by 25% in the four years after 1926, and profit margins rose as prices remained constant despite component cost reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

The [[phoebus_cartel_and_its_impact_on_light_bulbs | Phoebus Cartel]] publicly claimed its purpose was to increase standardization and efficiency, notably establishing a standard screw thread still common today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, evidence points to its true motivation being profit and increased sales at the expense of consumer benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

The Livermore bulb's longevity is partly attributed to being made before the cartel era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Additionally, its filament was consistently run at low power (four to five watts) as a nightlight, and being continuously on reduced thermal cycling stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Decline of the Cartel

The [[phoebus_cartel_and_its_impact_on_light_bulbs | Phoebus Cartel]], initially intended to last until 1955, dissolved in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. It faced challenges from external competition and non-compliance among members, but its ultimate demise was precipitated by the outbreak of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Despite its end, the practice of intentionally shortening product lifespans, now known as planned obsolescence, persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Modern Light Bulbs

In the last two decades, light bulb technology has evolved significantly. Incandescent bulbs, which remained largely unchanged for a century, have been succeeded by compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs and, most recently, by [[history_and_development_of_leds | LED]] technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Modern [[history_and_development_of_leds | LED]] bulbs use about a tenth of the energy and can last anywhere from 10 to 50 times longer than their predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, effectively achieving a point where they are considered "everlasting" for practical purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

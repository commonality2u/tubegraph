A common psychological phenomenon known as confirmation bias can be illustrated through a simple number sequence game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">00:00:01</a>. In this game, a facilitator establishes a secret rule for a three-number sequence and provides an initial example, such as "2, 4, 8" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">00:00:19</a>. Participants then propose their own three-number sequences, and the facilitator indicates whether they follow the rule or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">00:00:09</a>. The goal is to deduce the hidden rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">00:00:05</a>.

## The Game Experience

When presented with the sequence "2, 4, 8," participants commonly form an early hypothesis, such as "multiply by 2" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">00:00:47</a>. They then propose sequences that confirm this hypothesis, like "16, 32, 64" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">00:00:32</a>, "3, 6, 12" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">00:00:55</a>, or "100, 200, 400" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">00:01:13</a>. All these examples would be confirmed as following the rule by the facilitator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">00:00:44</a>, even though "multiply by 2" is *not* the actual rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">00:00:47</a>. This leads to a prolonged struggle to identify the correct rule, as players continually seek "yes" answers that confirm their initial incorrect assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">00:01:26</a>.

The actual rule for the game is simply "numbers in increasing order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">00:02:53</a>, meaning any three numbers where the second is greater than the first, and the third is greater than the second (e.g., 1, 2, 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">00:02:24</a> or 7, 8, 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">00:02:27</a>) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">00:03:06</a>. This was often only discovered when participants proposed sequences *not* based on their hypothesis, such as "2, 4, 7" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">00:01:47</a> (which still fits the rule) or, crucially, "10, 9, 8" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">00:02:49</a> (which does *not* follow the rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">00:02:51</a>.

## Confirmation Bias and the Scientific Method

This game serves as an excellent illustration of [[cognitive_bias_and_hypothesis_testing|confirmation bias]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">00:03:36</a>. It highlights the human tendency to:
*   Form a hypothesis early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">00:03:39</a>.
*   Propose examples that fit that hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">00:03:39</a>.
*   Seek information that confirms what one already believes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">00:03:50</a>.

The game's design, inspired by Nassim Taleb's book *The Black Swan* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">00:03:14</a>, underscores a crucial principle: you can never definitively *prove* a theory true, no matter how many confirming instances you observe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">00:03:29</a>. The metaphor of the "black swan" refers to the unexpected, illustrating that even if all observed swans are white, the discovery of a single black swan disproves the theory that "all swans are white" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">00:03:22</a>.

Instead of seeking "yes" answers, the most informative approach is to seek "no" answers or to actively try to disprove one's own beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">00:03:55</a>. This is central to the [[cognitive_bias_and_hypothesis_testing|scientific method]]: scientists intentionally set out to disprove their theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">00:04:06</a>. It is only when theories cannot be disproven that they are considered to reflect something truly accurate about reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">00:04:12</a>. Applying this approach of rigorous self-disproof can help individuals avoid self-deception and arrive closer to the truth in all aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">00:04:18</a>.

## Definition and Properties
Platonic solids are three-dimensional objects characterized by having all faces identical and all vertices identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This symmetry allows them to be rotated through certain angles and appear the same as before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. There are only five such solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The five Platonic solids include:
*   The cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   The tetrahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   The octahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   The dodecahedron (which has 12 pentagonal sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   The icosahedron (which has 20 sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

## Johannes Kepler's Astronomical Model
Over 400 years ago in Prague, Johannes Kepler, a renowned scientist, believed in a geometric regularity in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Before discovering that planetary orbits are ellipses, Kepler proposed a model of the solar system where planets orbited on nested spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

In this model, the planetary spheres were separated by the Platonic solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This concept was convenient for Kepler because, in his time, only six planets were known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This allowed him to place a unique Platonic solid as a spacer between each of the six planetary spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. He carefully arranged the order of the Platonic solids to match the known distances between planets as closely as possible through astronomical observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Kepler's attraction to geometry also extended to practical problems, such as how to efficiently stack cannonballs, leading to [[keplers_conjecture_on_sphere_packing | Kepler's conjecture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

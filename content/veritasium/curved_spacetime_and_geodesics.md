According to the [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | general theory of relativity]], gravity is not a force and there are no gravitational fields; instead, gravity is considered an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This perspective views objects as moving along straight paths in curved spacetime.

## Einstein's Happiest Thought and the Equivalence Principle

Albert Einstein's "happiest thought" involved imagining a man falling off a roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. His realization was that this falling man would feel weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Anything he dropped would remain stationary relative to him or move in uniform motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This scenario is analogous to being in deep space, far from large masses, where one would also feel no weight and objects would remain stationary or move at constant velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

An observer in deep space, not accelerating or in a gravitational field, is defined as an inertial observer, where all laws of physics apply in their reference frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Einstein's big leap was concluding that the man falling from a roof and the "Rocket Man" in deep space are physically equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This means the falling man is *not* in a gravitational field and is *not* accelerating; he is also an inertial observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The equivalence principle states that if observers feel weightless, they are in an inertial frame of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Even as "Rocket Man" approaches a planet and speeds up due to its influence, he continues to feel weightless and experiences no acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. An onboard accelerometer would register no change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Therefore, his frame of reference remains inertial until he crashes into the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Gravity as Curved Spacetime

The concept that gravity is not a force but rather an effect of curved spacetime is central to [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | general relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. "Rocket Man" observes himself moving with constant velocity in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, spacetime around massive objects like planets is curved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, which makes his "straight line" path appear curved to a distant observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Geodesics

The shortest paths over curved surfaces are called **geodesics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This term is also used for the straight-line paths followed by inertial observers through curved spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

*   **Analogy: Airplane Routes**
    Airplanes fly the shortest route between cities, which appears as a straight line on a flat map but is actually a curved path on the Earth's spherical surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Analogy: Lines of Longitude**
    If two people start 1000 kilometers apart on the equator and walk due North, they will eventually come together at the North Pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This convergence, though feeling like a force pushing them together, is simply a consequence of following straight paths (geodesics) on a curved surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Astronauts on the space station are weightless, meaning they are inertial observers traveling on a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The Earth curves spacetime around it, causing their straight-line path to appear as a helix, or a circular orbit if the time dimension is ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Misleading Analogies

The common "bent sheet analogy" for curved spacetime, often depicted with a heavy ball creating a dip, can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. It can reinforce the incorrect intuition that objects "fall" towards the middle of a well due to a gravitational force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. In [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | general relativity]], there is no gravitational force; objects simply travel on straight-line paths through spacetime, which appears curved because spacetime itself is curved around massive objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

The principle is summarized as: "Matter tells spacetime how to curve, and spacetime tells matter how to move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Acceleration in Curved Spacetime

If a rocket ship in deep space turns on its thrusters and accelerates at 9.8 meters per second squared, objects inside would appear to accelerate downwards, and one would feel a force pushing up on their feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This situation feels exactly the same as being at rest on the surface of Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

In [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | general relativity]], being at rest on Earth's surface means you are *not* an inertial observer because you do not feel weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Your situation is identical to someone accelerating on a rocket ship in deep space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. There is no gravitational field; you are accelerating upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

In Newtonian physics, your weight force is balanced by a normal force, resulting in no net force and no acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. However, in [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | general relativity]], gravity is not a force, and you have no weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The only force acting on you is the normal force from the floor pushing you up, meaning you *are* accelerating upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This upward acceleration is a deviation from a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, as the floor prevents you from following a straight line path through spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### The Equation of Motion

A [[general_relativity_equations | general relativity equation]] for acceleration shows that the second derivative of position with respect to time (acceleration) can be non-zero even if your spatial coordinates are not changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This is due to a term related to the curvature of spacetime and your velocity through time squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Thus, in curved spacetime, you need to accelerate just to stand still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Unifying Gravitational and Inertial Mass

[[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | General relativity]] simplifies the classical mystery of why all objects fall at the same rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. In Newtonian physics, this is explained by the cancellation of gravitational mass (which creates and experiences gravity) and inertial mass (resistance to acceleration) in the force equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Scientists have conducted extensive [[experiments_and_predictions_related_to_general_relativity | experiments]] to confirm these two types of mass are numerically identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

However, in [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | general relativity]], there is no mystery because objects are not accelerating; they are simply following straight-line paths through spacetime until something stops them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Just like objects in the accelerating rocket ship appear to fall at the same rate because it's the floor accelerating into them, free-falling objects on Earth are also not truly accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

## Experimental Verification

In 1915, Einstein proposed a [[experiments_and_predictions_related_to_general_relativity | measurable prediction]] to test his theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
If a rocket ship accelerates, light beamed across its cabin will hit the opposite wall slightly lower than its source because the rocket has sped up during the light's travel time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This demonstrates that an accelerating frame of reference will bend light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

Einstein reasoned that light must also bend when it passes a large mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The ideal experiment was to observe light from distant stars passing near the Sun during a total solar eclipse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. In 1919, Arthur Eddington conducted this experiment, and his findings showed that star positions were deflected by the precise amount predicted by [[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | Einstein's general theory of relativity]], which was twice the deflection calculated using a purely Newtonian model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. [[Einsteins theory of relativity | General relativity]] has passed nearly every test over the last century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

### The Accelerating Charge Experiment (Proposed)

A conceptual experimental test involves comparing the behavior of a stationary charged particle in a gravitational field to a free-falling one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

*   **Newtonian Prediction**: A stationary charge should not radiate electromagnetic radiation, but a free-falling one, being accelerated by gravity, should radiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **[[Einsteins Theory of General Relativity | General Relativity]] Prediction**: A free-falling charge is non-accelerating, simply moving on a straight line path through curved spacetime, and therefore should *not* radiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Conversely, a stationary charge is accelerating (deviating from a geodesic) and *should* give off electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

Logistical challenges have prevented this experiment from being carried out, but one's prediction for its outcome reveals their underlying belief about the true nature of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

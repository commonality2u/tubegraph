According to the [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | general theory of relativity]], gravity is not a force and there are no gravitational fields; instead, gravity is an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Einstein's Happiest Thought and the Equivalence Principle
[[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Albert Einstein's]] "happiest thought" was imagining a man falling off the roof of a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This thought made him happy because he realized that the falling man would not feel his own weight, experiencing weightlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Anything the man dropped would remain stationary relative to him or move in uniform motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This scenario is equivalent to being in deep space, away from large masses, where a spaceship is at rest or coasting at constant velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. In deep space, one would feel no weight, and objects would remain stationary or move in a straight line at constant velocity after a push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

An observer in such a deep space scenario is an inertial observer, meaning they are not accelerating and are not in a gravitational field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. All the laws of physics apply in their reference frame, and no experiment could distinguish their inertial reference frame from any other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

[[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Einstein's]] big leap was the **Equivalence Principle**, which states that these two scenarios (man falling from a roof and a "Rocket Man" in deep space) are physically equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This implies that the man falling from the roof is not in a gravitational field and is not accelerating; he is an inertial observer, just like the Rocket Man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The key is the experience of the observer: if they feel weightless, they are in an inertial frame of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Gravity as Curved Spacetime
When Rocket Man approaches a planet, an external observer might see his path bend towards the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. However, Rocket Man inside his ship would remain oblivious, feeling no force and experiencing no acceleration, even as his rocket speeds up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. An onboard accelerometer would not register any change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This leads to the conclusion that Rocket Man continues on his inertial path through [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | spacetime]] until he crashes into the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

The explanation for the curved path without gravitational forces is [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | curved spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Rocket Man feels like he's moving with constant velocity in a straight line because he is moving in a straight line through [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | spacetime]] around massive objects like planets is curved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, making his path appear curved to a distant observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

This concept can be understood through analogies:
*   **Airplane Paths**: Airplanes fly the shortest route (a straight line) between cities, but because the Earth's surface is curved, these paths appear curved on a flat map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Geodesics**: These shortest paths over curved surfaces are called **geodesics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The same term is used for the straight-line paths followed by inertial observers through [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | curved spacetime]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Equator Analogy**: Two people starting 1000 kilometers apart on the equator and walking due North will eventually come closer and bump into each other at the North Pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. It seems as if a force is pushing them together, but they feel no force; the real reason is they are on straight paths (geodesics) on a curved surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Gravity is like this apparent force; it doesn't actually exist in the way we commonly perceive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Astronauts on the space station are weightless, meaning they are also inertial observers traveling on a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The Earth curves [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | spacetime]] around it, which is why their straight-line path appears as a helix, or a circular orbit if the time dimension is ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### The Misleading Bent Sheet Analogy
The "bent sheet" analogy for [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | curved spacetime]] can be misleading because it can reinforce the intuition that objects fall into a well due to gravitational force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. In [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | General Relativity]], there is no gravitational force; objects travel on straight-line paths through [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | spacetime]] that appears curved because [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | spacetime]] itself is curved around massive objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The core principle is "Matter tells [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | spacetime]] how to curve, and [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | spacetime]] tells matter how to move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Acceleration in Curved Spacetime
If the Rocket Man in deep space turns on his thrusters and accelerates at 9.8 meters per second squared, an external observer would see objects inside the rocket remain stationary while the floor accelerates into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Inside, everything would appear to accelerate down, and he would feel a force pushing up on his feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This situation feels exactly the same as being at rest on the surface of Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

In [[einsteins_general_theory_of_relativity | General Relativity]], if you are watching a video while standing on Earth, you are not an inertial observer because you do not feel weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Your situation is exactly the same as someone accelerating on a rocket ship in deep space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. You are accelerating, and there is no gravitational field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

In standard Newtonian physics, your weight force pushes you down, and the normal force from the floor pushes you up, resulting in no net force and no acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. However, in [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | General Relativity]], gravity is not a force, and you have no weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The only force on you is the normal force pushing you up, meaning you are accelerating upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. While your spatial coordinates may not be changing relative to the room, an inertial observer (like the man falling off the roof) would see you accelerating upwards at 9.8 meters per second squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

Acceleration is a deviation from a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. You cannot follow a straight-line path through [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | spacetime]] because the floor applies an upward force, causing you to accelerate upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. In [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | curved spacetime]], unlike flat spacetime, it is possible for your spatial coordinates to not change while you are still accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Your acceleration can be exactly equal to a term related to the curvature of [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | spacetime]] times your velocity through time squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Thus, in [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | curved spacetime]], you need to accelerate just to stand still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Why All Objects Fall at the Same Rate
One mystery in classical physics that becomes simpler in [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | General Relativity]] is why all objects fall at the same rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Newtonian physics explains this by canceling out the object's mass from both sides of the equation `F = ma` (`GmM/r^2 = ma`), meaning all objects have the same acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. The mystery lies in why **gravitational mass** (property creating/experiencing a gravitational field) and **inertial mass** (resistance to acceleration) are numerically identical, despite being conceptually different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This has been experimentally tested to very high precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

In [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | General Relativity]], there is no mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. All objects *appear* to fall the same way because they are not accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>; they are simply following straight-line paths through [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | spacetime]] until something stops them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Like objects in the accelerating rocket ship, they *appear* to accelerate at the same rate because it's the floor (or the Earth's surface) accelerating into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

## Experimental Evidence: Bending of Light
In 1915, [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Einstein]] proposed a measurable prediction to test his theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. In an accelerating rocket ship, a light beam shone across the cabin would appear to deflect downwards to an observer inside, even though an external observer would see it travel in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This means an accelerating frame of reference bends light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

[[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Einstein]] reasoned that light must also bend when it passes a large mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The ideal experiment was to observe light from distant stars passing just next to the Sun during a total solar eclipse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. In 1919, Arthur Eddington conducted this experiment and found that the apparent positions of stars were deflected by the precise amount predicted by [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Einstein's General Theory of Relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. This deflection was twice what some had calculated using a strictly Newtonian model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | General Relativity]] has passed virtually every test since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

## Unfinished Experiment: Radiating Charges
Another conceptual experimental test involves comparing the behavior of a stationary charge in a gravitational field to a free-falling one, considering that accelerating charges radiate electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   **Newtonian Picture**: A stationary charge should not radiate, but a free-falling one is accelerating and therefore should radiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **[[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | General Relativity]] Picture**: The free-falling charge is non-accelerating, simply following a straight-line path through [[SpaceTime Curvature and the Shape of the Universe | curved spacetime]], so it should *not* radiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. The stationary charge *is* accelerating (as it's being prevented from following a geodesic) and therefore *should* give off electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

Logistical challenges have prevented this experiment from being carried out, but it highlights the fundamental difference in understanding the nature of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

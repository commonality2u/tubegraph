Acquiring and managing large quantities of [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] presents significant logistical challenges, as demonstrated by an experiment involving 10,000 units purchased for a swimming test.

## Acquisition Challenges

Manufacturers of [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] are typically hesitant to sell them to residential customers, often refusing such requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. In one instance, a manufacturer made an exception to sell 10,000 [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] for a scientific demonstration, explicitly stating they would not promote private use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Transportation Difficulties

[[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | Shade balls]] are notably heavy, as they are half-full of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. A single bag containing 1,200 [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] weighs approximately 300 kilograms (660 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The sheer volume and weight of 10,000 [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] made transportation a considerable undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. They were transported in the back of a U-Haul, requiring the driver to operate the largest vehicle they had ever attempted across Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. A moving company was ultimately hired to assist with the handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Post-Experiment Distribution

After the experiment of [[swimming_in_shade_balls | swimming in shade balls]] was complete, the logistical challenge shifted to deciding what to do with the 10,000 [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The plan devised was to sign each individual ball and mail them to supporters around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The anticipated shipping costs for such a large quantity of heavy items were acknowledged as "horrendous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

> [!warning] Note
> The experiment involving [[swimming_in_shade_balls | swimming in shade balls]] was conducted in a private pool, not in a drinking [[purpose_of_shade_balls_in_reservoirs | reservoir]], where it would be prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This specific demonstration was not promoted as an activity people should attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

The phenomenon known as the [[dzhanibekov_effect_and_the_tennis_racket_theorem | Dzhanibekov effect]], also called the [[dzhanibekov_effect_and_the_tennis_racket_theorem | tennis racket theorem]] or the intermediate axis theorem, has a notable historical context, including a period of secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Discovery of the Dzhanibekov Effect

In 1985, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov was on a mission to rescue the completely shut-down Soviet space station Salyut 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This dramatic mission was later adapted into a Russian movie in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. After successfully rescuing the station, Dzhanibekov was unpacking supplies secured with a wing-nut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. As the wing-nut spun off its bolt, he observed a strange behavior: it maintained its orientation briefly, then flipped 180 degrees, and continued to flip back and forth at regular intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This motion occurred without any external forces or torques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Period of Secrecy

The peculiar and counterintuitive phenomenon observed by Dzhanibekov was kept secret by the Russians for ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Six years later, in 1991, a related paper titled "The Twisting Tennis Racket" was published in the *Journal of Dynamics and Differential Equations*, but it made no mention of the secret [[dzhanibekov_effect_and_the_tennis_racket_theorem | Dzhanibekov effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Known Physics

Despite the perceived novelty and secrecy, the phenomenon itself, known as the intermediate axis theorem, is not new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. It is even covered in texts like Landau and Lifschitz, and understanding of it dates back at least 150 years to Louis Poinsot's "The New Theory of Rotating Bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. However, in microgravity, the effect is significantly more striking than the half-twist of a tennis racket, leading to frequent questions about its authenticity on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Reasons for Secrecy

The secrecy surrounding the [[dzhanibekov_effect_and_the_tennis_racket_theorem | Dzhanibekov effect]] likely stemmed from a chilling implication Dzhanibekov himself considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. After observing the wing-nut, he experimented with a ball of modeling clay, which also flipped periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This led to the hypothesis that Earth, as a spinning body in space, could also flip over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

This idea gained traction, especially around the Mayan prophecies of the end of the world in 2012, with speculation spreading among conspiracy theorists and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. On May 13, 2012, the official Russian federal space agency, RusCosmos, published an article honoring Dzhanibekov's 70th birthday, stating that "the spinning nut of Dzhanibekov caused astonishment and simultaneous danger to a certain part of the scientific world" and that "a hypothesis was proposed that our planet, in the course of its orbital motion, can execute the same overturn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### Validity of the Hypothesis

The concern about Earth flipping is addressed by understanding how objects dissipate energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. While angular momentum remains constant for an isolated object, kinetic energy can be converted into other forms, like heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Objects with internal energy dissipation mechanisms, such as a liquid-filled cylinder or the flexible antennas of the Explorer 1 satellite, tend towards a lowest energy state where they rotate about the axis with the maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

Earth, with internal energy dissipation mechanisms, behaves similarly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. It has come to spin about its axis of maximum moment of inertia, which is stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. This is why Mars's Tharsis Rise, a major mass concentration, is located at its equator, ensuring maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Most asteroids also spin around their axis with the maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Therefore, the Earth will not flip over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

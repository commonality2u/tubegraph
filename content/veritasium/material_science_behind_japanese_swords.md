Japanese swords, renowned for their strength and sharpness, are capable of slicing a bullet in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The method of making these swords has remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years, with everything done by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. They are still considered to be among the best in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The [[cultural_significance_and_artistry_of_japanese_swords|artistry]] and the quality of these swords are so highly regarded that a 16th-century sword was appraised at $105 million, making it the most expensive sword ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Raw Materials: Iron Sand

Steel is an alloy of iron, which is the fourth-most-common element in Earth's crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Most of the world's iron comes from banded iron formations, sedimentary rock layers with high concentrations of iron oxide, up to 60% by weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Japan's volcanic geology, however, has very few of these sedimentary iron oxides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This likely contributed to the country being late to the steel production game, as steel artifacts found in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) are nearly 4,000 years old, while Japan imported metals until the 8th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

To source iron, the Japanese utilized igneous rocks like granite and diorite, which contain iron oxides in lower concentrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. As mountains weather, these iron oxides are broken apart and washed downstream, becoming part of the sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Japanese artisans observed that iron oxides, being denser than other minerals, accumulate where rivers change direction or speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. To amplify this effect, they deliberately created diversions in rivers, damming off sections and dragging sand into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This method yields iron sands with up to 80% iron oxides by weight, a concentration higher than high-quality iron ore, and with fewer impurities, making it an excellent source for high-quality steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## The [[description_of_the_tatara_method|Tatara Method]]

The steel used in the best Japanese swords is made using the Tatara method, a process that has remained largely unchanged for 1300 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. In this method, iron oxides are heated to over 1,250 degrees Celsius to break the bonds with oxygen and produce pure iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Pure iron, however, is softer than bronze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The key element is carbon, primarily sourced from charcoal, which is almost pure carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Adding a small amount of carbon to iron creates steel, an incredibly strong alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

The Tatara smelter is lit for only one night each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Ceremonial prayers are said, and a Shinto priest lights the fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Workers remain at the smelter for at least 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Iron sand is mixed with water to prevent it from flying up in the flame, but too much water could cause the kiln to explode due to steam generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This crucial mixing is done by feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Inside the smelter, temperatures reach up to 1500 degrees Celsius, just below the melting point of iron (1538 Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The iron doesn't become liquid but softens and clumps into a large block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Impurities like sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon oxides combine with carbon from the charcoal and melt at a lower temperature, flowing to the bottom as slag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Slag is periodically removed throughout the smelting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

After about 21 hours of smelting, with hundreds of kilograms of charcoal and iron sand added, a 100-kilogram block of steel, iron, and slag is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Only about a third of this block is high-quality enough for sword making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The steel is then sorted by quality and carbon content by eye, a skill required for swordsmith certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

## Forging: Folding the Steel

The sorted steel is sent to swordsmiths to begin the forging process, which is part of the [[traditional_japanese_sword_making_process|traditional Japanese sword making process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. In a coal oven, the steel is heated until soft and malleable, then flattened with hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. After flattening, the steel is bent back on itself and hammered again to press it into a solid block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

Folding the steel serves two critical purposes:
1.  **Impurity Distribution**: It spreads out impurities like silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus throughout the steel, ensuring uniform consistency and eliminating weak points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
2.  **Grain and Patterns**: It gives the steel a grain, reinforcing it in the direction of impact during combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Additionally, exposure to air during folding causes slight oxidation, creating darker steel that forms beautiful patterns when folded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

While some swords can have over a billion layers (achieved with around 30 folds, as each fold doubles the layers), a typical sword is folded 10 to 13 times, resulting in a few thousand layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

## Differential Hardening and Quenching

A blade is not made from a single block of steel; different carbon percentages are used for different parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Carbon atoms, being smaller than iron atoms, fit inside the iron crystal lattice, stressing the steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. A higher carbon percentage makes the steel harder and more rigid, but also more brittle, prone to chipping and shattering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

To achieve the desired properties, swordsmiths use high-carbon steel for the edge to ensure hardness and rigidity, maintaining a sharp edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. The spine, conversely, is made of lower-carbon steel, allowing the sword to flex without breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. These different carbon content steels are welded together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

After the blade is hammered into its straight shape, it's covered in a layer of clay: thick on the spine and thin on the edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The sword is then heated in a furnace and rapidly cooled in water, a process known as quenching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Due to the varying clay thicknesses, the edge cools faster than the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

*   **Spine**: The thick clay causes slow cooling, allowing carbon atoms to leave the iron matrix. This forms **ferrite** and **cementite**, which combine to create **perlite**â€”a mostly soft and ductile form of steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
*   **Edge**: The thin clay leads to rapid cooling, trapping more carbon in the lattice. This forces the lattice structure to change from cubic to tetragonal, forming **martensite** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. Martensite is incredibly hard due to the trapped carbon stressing the lattice, making it ideal for the sword's edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

The tetragonal lattice structure of martensite also takes up more space, causing the edge to expand relative to the spine and curve the sword backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This process gives the samurai sword its iconic curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. The boundary between these different steel types is visible as a color difference, known as *hamon* (edge pattern) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. About one-third of all blades shatter during this quenching process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

After quenching, the sword is briefly placed back in the forge to evaporate remaining water and slightly loosen some crystal structures, making the sword less brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

## Finishing: Polishing and Sharpening

Once forged, the sword is sent to a polisher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. The polishing and sharpening are done by hand using whetstones of different coarsenesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. This meticulous process can take up to a month for a single sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Occasionally, swords are also engraved with beautiful patterns, though this is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

The creation of Japanese swords involves immense care, attention, and expertise at every step, from gathering iron sand and smelting to forging and sharpening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. These discoveries, made through trial and error, produced artifacts of such high quality that they are still prized centuries later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

The [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]] is a phenomenon that influences the flight of rotating objects moving through a fluid, such as air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It is observed when a ball or cylinder spins, causing air on one side to move in the same direction as the spin, and air on the opposite side to move against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This interaction creates a net force on the object, pushing it in the direction of the air deflected by the spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The effect was described by Heinrich Gustav Magnus in 1852 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, though Isaac Newton had observed it nearly two centuries earlier in the flight of tennis balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Demonstration at Gordon Dam

Friends dropped a basketball from the Gordon Dam in Tasmania, which is 126.5 meters (415 feet) high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   A basketball dropped without spin landed directly below the drop point, only slightly pushed by the breeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   When a basketball was dropped with backspin, it dramatically took off horizontally, moving far from its initial drop point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This dramatic deviation was due to the [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Sports Applications

The [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]] is highly significant in various sports involving projectile motion:
*   **Tennis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   **Soccer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   **Golf** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>

## [[non_sport_uses_of_magnus_effect | Non-Sport Applications]]

While crucial in sports, the [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]] also has potential [[non_sport_uses_of_magnus_effect | non-sport applications]]:

### Flettner Rotors on Ships
Ships can be propelled using spinning cylinders called "Flettner rotors" instead of traditional sails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. These rotors deflect crosswinds, using the [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]] to propel the ship forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. An example is the E-Ship 1, which uses four Flettner rotors to increase efficiency and reduce diesel consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Experimental Aircraft
The [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]] has been explored in aircraft design:
*   An experimental plane was designed with spinning cylinders taking the place of wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   These cylinders generated more lift than traditional wings using the [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   However, they also created significantly more drag, making the design impractical; this particular plane only flew once before crashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   Despite past setbacks, the [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]] is seeing a comeback, with experimental rotor wing aircraft designed to generate all their lift from spinning cylinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

The future may see the [[magnus_effect_explanation | Magnus effect]] assisting more than just basketballs in flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Following World War II, J. Robert Oppenheimer became a national hero, appearing on the cover of Time Magazine and becoming a household name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. In 1947, he was appointed director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton and became chairman of the General Advisory Committee, advising on [[Ethical implications of nuclear weapons | nuclear weapons]]-related issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. He used this position to advocate for [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cooperation | arms control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.

### The Soviet Atomic Test and "The Super"
In August 1949, the Soviet Union successfully tested its first atomic weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. In response, the US military quickly decided that the best course of action was to develop a more powerful bomb, known as "The Super," or the hydrogen bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

### Oppenheimer's Stance
Oppenheimer opposed the [[Development of the atomic bomb | development of "The Super"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. His opposition was based on [[Ethical implications of nuclear weapons | ethical grounds]] and the concern that it would initiate a [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cooperation | nuclear arms race]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.

Despite his objections, the Truman administration proceeded with the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. Three years later, Ivy Mike, the first hydrogen bomb, was tested in the Marshall Islands, with a yield of 10.4 megatons of TNT, 400 times more powerful than the Trinity test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. In 1961, the Soviet Union tested the Tsar Bomba, the most powerful explosion ever detonated, which was five times more powerful than Ivy Mike and approximately 2000 times more powerful than Trinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. This type of [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cooperation | arms race]] was precisely what Oppenheimer had feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

### Consequences of Opposition
In part due to his opposition to the hydrogen bomb and his calls to avert a [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cooperation | nuclear arms race]], Oppenheimer was put on trial to revoke his security clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. He had been surveilled during his work on the [[j_robert_oppenheimer_and_the_manhattan_project | Manhattan Project]], and this surveillance continued afterwards, with many wiretaps being illegal and warrantless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.

Oppenheimer was questioned about his ties to the Communist Party, including an affair with a party member while he led the Los Alamos lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. He was essentially accused of treason and espionage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. In December 1953, his security clearance was suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

In 1965, when asked about proposals for talks with the Soviet Union to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons, Oppenheimer responded:
> "It should have been done the day after Trinity." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>

Oppenheimer was diagnosed with throat cancer later that year and died on February 18, 1967, at the age of 62 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.

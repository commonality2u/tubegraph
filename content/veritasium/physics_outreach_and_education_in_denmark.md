A team of [[Challenges of lifting heavy objects in physics demonstrations | physics]] and chemistry demonstrators in Denmark has developed innovative methods for outreach and education, particularly by expanding upon the traditional Ruben's tube experiment [00:00:48]. Their primary goal is to travel around Denmark, educating children about [[Challenges of lifting heavy objects in physics demonstrations | physics]] [00:05:03]. They also maintain a YouTube channel to share their demonstrations more widely [00:05:12].

## The Pyro Board: A 2D Ruben's Tube

The Ruben's tube is a classic [[Challenges of lifting heavy objects in physics demonstrations | physics]] demonstration involving a pipe with multiple holes where flammable gas is introduced and ignited, forming a line of Bunsen burners [00:00:15]. When sounds are played into the tube, standing waves are formed, which are patterns of air vibration with areas of high and low vibration [00:00:28]. These vibrations affect the gas flow rate, causing the flame heights to vary and visually display the standing wave pattern [00:00:43].

The Danish team significantly evolved this concept by creating a two-dimensional Ruben's tube, effectively "a whole plane of Bunsen burners" [00:00:56]. This device, dubbed the "Pyro Board," contains 2,500 holes [00:01:02] and was conceived with the principle that "when you put on more fire, then it always gets better" [00:01:14].

## Demonstrating Standing Waves

The Pyro Board vividly demonstrates wave phenomena:
*   **Fundamental Frequency** By adjusting the frequency of sound, the team can find the lowest frequency that produces a clear standing wave pattern [00:01:22]. This is referred to as the "fundamental" standing wave [00:01:57].
*   **Volume Variation** Varying the volume of the sound input also clearly impacts the flame heights [00:01:59].
*   **Higher Frequencies** Increasing the frequency of the sound reveals more complex standing wave patterns [00:03:04].
*   **Audible Nodes and Anti-nodes** It's possible to discern nodes (areas of minimal vibration) and anti-nodes (areas of maximal vibration) by listening, as the sound pressure varies significantly in these locations [00:02:27].

    > "The flames are coming up in the anti-nodes, yeah." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
*   **Music Visualization** The Pyro Board can also visualize music, particularly patterns created by bass frequencies [00:03:32].

### Support for Scientific Exploration

The development and display of the Pyro Board, and other scientific outreach initiatives, are supported by various means, including platforms like [[Audibles role in supporting scientific exploration | Audible.com]] [00:05:28]. This support enables the creation of educational content and allows for interactions with figures important to the [[history of physics and mathematics discoveries | history of physics and mathematics discoveries]], such as insights into the life of [[history of physics and mathematics discoveries | Galileo]] [00:05:43], and contemporary figures like [[Realworld experiments and simulations demonstrating the effect | Michio Kaku]] [00:06:20]. Such support plays a crucial role in promoting scientific understanding and engagement globally.

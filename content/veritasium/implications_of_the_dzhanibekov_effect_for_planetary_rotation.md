## Discovery and Initial Speculation

The [[dzhanibekov_effect_and_the_tennis_racket_theorem | Dzhanibekov effect]], also known as the [[dzhanibekov_effect_and_the_tennis_racket_theorem | tennis racket theorem]] or intermediate axis theorem, describes how an object spinning about its intermediate axis of inertia will periodically flip 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This phenomenon was famously observed in 1985 by cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov aboard the Salyut 7 space station when a wing-nut spun off a bolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. The wing-nut maintained its orientation for a short time, then flipped 180 degrees, and continued flipping back and forth at regular intervals without external forces or torques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. This counterintuitive phenomenon was [[historical_context_and_secrecy_of_the_Dzhanibekov_effect | kept secret by the Russians for 10 years]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

After observing the wing-nut, Dzhanibekov attached a ball of modeling clay to it and found that it also flipped periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This led to the implication that if Earth is a spinning ball in space, it too could potentially flip over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. Speculation arose, especially around 2012 with Mayan prophecies, connecting this effect to Earth's magnetic pole reversals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

In 2012, the official site of the Russian Federal Space Agency, Roscosmos, published an article for Dzhanibekov's 70th birthday stating:
> <p class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</p>
> The spinning nut of Dzhanibekov caused astonishment and simultaneous danger to a certain part of the scientific world. A hypothesis was proposed that our planet, in the course of its orbital motion, can execute the same overturn.

## Why Earth Will Not Flip

Despite initial concerns, Earth is not expected to flip over. Clues can be gathered from experiments and principles of energy dissipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

### Energy Dissipation and Stability
For an isolated object spinning in space, angular momentum remains constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. However, its kinetic energy can be converted into other forms, such as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.

Astronaut Don Pettit's experiments on the space station demonstrate this:
*   A solid book or cylinder spins stably about its first (smallest moment of inertia) or third (largest moment of inertia) axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.
*   A liquid-filled cylinder spinning about its first axis (smallest moment of inertia) is unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. As the liquid sloshes around, energy dissipates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. Spinning about the smallest moment of inertia means spinning with the greatest kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. As kinetic energy is dissipated, the cylinder will eventually rotate about the axis that achieves the minimum kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. This is the axis with the largest moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>.

Thus, for a given amount of angular momentum, rotating with the maximum moment of inertia is the lowest energy state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>. All bodies with any way of dissipating energy will tend towards this state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

### Real-World Examples
*   **Explorer 1 Satellite**: The first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, was designed to spin about its long axis for spin stabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. However, within hours of achieving orbit, it was rotating end-over-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. This occurred because its flexible antennas allowed the satellite to dissipate energy, gradually reducing its kinetic energy until it rotated about the axis that maximized its moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.
*   **Earth**: The Earth has internal ways of dissipating energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. Over time, it has come to spin about the axis with the maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.
*   **Mars**: Most astronomical objects exhibit similar behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. Mars, for example, has a significant mass concentration called the Tharsis Rise located at its equator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. This placement ensures it is as far as possible from the axis of rotation, which maximizes Mars' moment of inertia, ensuring stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.
*   **Asteroids**: Almost all asteroids rotate around the axis with their maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Earth, like most celestial bodies that can dissipate internal energy, is spinning about its axis with the maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. This state is stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. Therefore, the Earth will not flip over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.

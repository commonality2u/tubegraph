Controlling the movement of spiders is crucial for conducting specific experiments, particularly those investigating their [[spider_response_to_visual_stimuli | visual perception]].

## Experimental Setup and Challenge

The primary goal of certain experiments is to observe if a spider will attempt to follow a moving shape displayed on a screen. This shape is designed to differ from the background in color but not in brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

A significant challenge arises because if a [[jumping_spider_behavior | jumping spider]] is allowed to turn and respond freely, its movement will alter what it sees, affecting the experimental conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Therefore, researchers require precise control over the spider's visual input at all times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Methods of Control

To maintain control over the spider's position and monitor its intended movements, researchers employ two main techniques:

### Magnetic Immobilization
Researchers hold the spiders in place using tiny [[use_of_magnets_in_spider_research | magnets]] attached to their heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This prevents the spider from physically turning and altering its view.

### Ball Treadmill for Intended Movement
While the spider is held, it is placed on a ball that it holds with its feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Researchers can monitor how the ball moves under the spider's feet to determine where the spider would intend to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. For example, if a spider turns the ball to the left, it likely indicates an attempt to look to the right to follow the moving shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

This method provides evidence of the spider's ability to discriminate between the colors of the shape and the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

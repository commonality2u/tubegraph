The Navy's Indoor Ocean at Carderock is the world's largest wave pool, designed to test scale models of ships before they are deployed in the open ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This facility allows engineers to make ships better by observing how different designs behave in real-world conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The water even looks ocean-colored, making it feel like a real ocean test facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Facility Overview

The pool is an immense structure, measuring 360 feet long in one dimension and 240 feet long in the other, with a depth of 20 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. It is roughly the size of a football field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The dome covering the facility was, for a period, the largest free-standing dome in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

The ability to control the waves is what distinguishes this facility from other wave pools globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Waves of specific amplitude and frequency can be created and replicated consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Wave Generation
The pool is equipped with 216 individual wave makers, which are huge paddles lining two walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. These paddles can create waves ranging from -45 degrees up to 135 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. They are programmed to move in precisely choreographed ways to produce reproducible, perfectly sized, and perfectly frequent waves that travel across the entire pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Air bellows facilitate the angular motion of these wave makers, and force transducers measure the forces involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Ultrasonic sensors are installed throughout the basin to measure wave height, period, and direction, ensuring that the tested conditions match the intended setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

## Wave Physics Demonstrations
The facility is ideal for observing properties of different waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Wave Characteristics
A fundamental characteristic of a wave is its wavelength, which is the distance between one crest and the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Waves transmit energy rather than material from one place to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. As a wave travels, water molecules move along circular paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This motion decreases with depth, stopping at a depth equal to half the wavelength, a point known as the wave base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. In an ideal water wave, molecules drift slightly in the direction of wave motion because they travel faster at the top of their loop than they move backward at the bottom, creating a spiral path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Frequency and Speed
The frequency of a wave affects its speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. High-frequency waves travel slower than low-frequency waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. When the water depth is greater than the wave base, wave speed is inversely proportional to its frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This principle is demonstrated by sending out high-frequency waves followed by lower-frequency waves; the lower-frequency waves gradually catch up, causing all waves to meet at the same time and place and break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Superposition and Interference
This meeting of waves illustrates the principle of superposition, where waves add together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The resulting water height is the sum of the individual wave heights at that point, creating a much larger breaking wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Engineers can also create standing waves by sending two regular waves towards each other, which results in a "quilt wave" pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. At certain points, waves cancel out to zero amplitude, while at others, they combine for maximum amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Circular wave fronts can also be generated from all directions, focusing all wave energy into a single "bullseye" spot, causing the wave to break when its height exceeds one-seventh of its wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## [[testing_scale_ship_models | Testing Scale Ship Models]]
The primary purpose of the facility is to simulate oceanic conditions for [[testing_scale_ship_models | scale ship models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Research engineers place models of multi-billion dollar vessels in the water to evaluate their behavior in various conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. For example, a five-inch significant wave height in the pool could scale up to 20-foot waves for a full-sized ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. When running free-running models, engineers typically use a racetrack-like path (e.g., a big circle or figure eight) to correlate headings to the full-scale vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Scaling Principles
For accurate real-world representation, several factors are considered:
*   **Water Type**: The pool uses fresh water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. When modeling, buoyancy differences between fresh and salty water must be accounted for by ballasting the models appropriately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Froude Number**: While fluid mechanics often requires keeping the Reynolds number constant, achieving the correct wave dynamics necessitates scaling based on the Froude number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The Froude number represents the ratio of inertial to gravitational forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. If a model ship's hull is 46 times smaller than the real thing, it must travel at one divided by the square root of 46 times its real-world speed to yield accurate data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. To make footage from the model look like the full-size ship, it must be slowed down by a factor of approximately 6.8 (the square root of 46) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This meticulous scaling ensures the physics are identical to a real ship on the open ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Some models are too small to carry their own power and instrumentation, so they are tethered to a carriage that tows them over the waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

### Real-World Conditions and Ship Design
Engineers in the pool can simulate various wave conditions encountered in different parts of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Most ocean waves are generated by wind, especially around storms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Five factors influence wave size and shape: wind speed, wind duration, fetch (distance over which wind acts), fetch width, and water depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

#### Wave Types
*   **Swell**: Higher frequency waves dissipate energy more quickly as they travel away from a storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Thus, the waves that travel long distances are fast-moving, low-frequency waves known as swell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. While noticeable at beaches (e.g., crashing waves 10 seconds apart on a calm day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>), swell is generally not a concern for ships in the open ocean, which might only "heave a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Wind Waves**: These are formed in three steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>:
    1.  Turbulent air motion from wind blowing across still water creates slight pressure variations, forming tiny centimeter-wavelength ripples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
    2.  The wind then acts on these ripples, increasing pressure differences between the front and top of wave crests, pulling them into larger waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
    3.  This interaction leads to even larger pressure differences and bigger waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. As waves interact, they develop a range of wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. As the wind persists, waves begin breaking, transferring kinetic energy into swirling eddies that dissipate energy as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. A "fully developed sea" is reached when energy dissipation matches the energy input from the wind, signifying maximum wave size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Rogue Waves**: These are typically not spontaneous but rather multiple waves meeting and combining to create an amplitude significantly larger than their individual heights, causing them to break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

#### Ocean Spectra
Different oceans have unique mixtures of wave frequencies, or "spectra," due to their geography and storm types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **North Sea**: Characterized by a "peakier spectrum" due to the limited fetch of its storms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   **Mid-Atlantic**: A broader spectrum best describes developing or decaying open ocean waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **North Atlantic**: Steady winds across the open ocean produce the broadest spectrum of wind waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

When [[testing_scale_ship_models | testing ship models]], engineers first determine the ship's deployment location and then create the appropriate wave spectra in the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

### Naval Ship Innovation
Innovation in ship design continues, with new "hair-brained ideas" being tested at the facility before costly full-scale construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Every ship in the Navy's fleet has undergone testing or review at this facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

One example of innovation is the "tumble home" design, which is shaped opposite to traditional ships that flare out to provide restoring force when rolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. Tumble home designs may offer benefits such as reduced above-water signatures (e.g., radar sections), making ships stealthier, faster, or more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

Tests also focus on practical concerns, such as the amount of water washing onto a ship's deck, which is critical for operations like helicopter landings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Cameras are used to monitor water ingress during these tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

Naval engineers "dork out on the science" of what they do, contributing significantly to naval operations, even if most sailors are unaware of the extent of this background work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

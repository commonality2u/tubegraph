[[properties_of_aerogel | Aerogel]] is known as the world's lightest, or least dense, solid, being 99.8% air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Some aerogels are so light that if all the air were removed from them, they would be less dense than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Invention

[[properties_of_aerogel | Aerogel]] was invented in 1931 by Professor Samuel Kistler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Kistler's invention stemmed from a bet with his colleague Charles Learned, concerning jellies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Jellies are combinations of liquids and solids, predominantly liquid embedded within a 3D solid structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This solid structure, or skeleton, has nano-sized pores and accounts for about 1% of the gel's mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

The challenge of the bet was to remove the liquid from a jelly without affecting its solid structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Simply evaporating the liquid causes the solid structure to shrink and crumple due to molecules pulling on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Kistler solved this problem in two main ways:
1.  **Liquid Replacement** He realized one liquid could be replaced with another inside the jelly by thorough washing, such as swapping water for alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Supercritical Drying** The jelly (with the new liquid) is then placed in a high-pressure vessel called an autoclave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. By heating it to a specific high-temperature, high-pressure point, known as the critical point of the liquid, the liquid transforms into a semi-liquid, semi-gas state called a supercritical fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. In this state, there is no longer a distinction between liquid and gas, and the molecules stop pulling on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Once the vessel is depressurized, the solid skeleton, which accounts for only 1% of the gel's mass, remains intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The pores, previously filled with liquid, are now filled with gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This nanoporous solid is what is known as [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

Kistler published his findings on [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] in *Nature* in 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Materials Used

Kistler initially made aerogels from various substances, including eggs, rubber, and nitrocellulose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Silica is also a common material used to create [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Silica Gel Example

A wet silica gel is described as rubbery and can be easily carved or broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. It consists of 97% alcohol within its pores, with the remaining 3% solid being amorphous silica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

During the manufacturing process, the alcohol in the gel is replaced with liquid carbon dioxide (CO₂) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Liquid CO₂ is preferred because it is non-flammable and has a low critical temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Once the liquid CO₂ has filled the gel's pores, it is then heated to become supercritical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. As the critical point is approached, the surface of the liquid becomes blurry and appears to have "weird waves" before the surface completely disappears, indicating the formation of the supercritical fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. In this state, the CO₂ can be vented without affecting the solid structure, leaving behind the [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

[[aerogel_properties_and_composition | Aerogel]] is the world's lightest, or least dense, solid, primarily composed of 99.8% air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Some aerogels are so light that if all the air were removed from them, they would be less dense than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Invention of Aerogel

[[History of Teflon and its discovery | Aerogel]] was invented in 1931 by Professor Samuel Kistler, following a bet with his colleague Charles Learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. The bet concerned jellies, which are combinations of liquids and solids, mostly liquid embedded within a 3D solid structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. This solid structure, or skeleton, has nano-sized pores and accounts for only about 1% of the gel's mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

The challenge was to remove the liquid from the jelly without affecting its delicate solid structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Simply evaporating the liquid causes the solid structure to shrink and crumple, as liquid molecules pull on each other and the surrounding solid structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Kistler's Solution

Samuel Kistler solved this problem using two key methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>:

1.  **Solvent Exchange**: He realized that one liquid could be replaced with another inside the jelly by thorough washing, such as swapping water for alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
2.  **Supercritical Drying**: The gel was then placed in a high-pressure vessel called an autoclave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. By heating it to a high-temperature, high-pressure point known as the critical point of the liquid, the liquid transformed into a supercritical fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. In this state, there is no longer a distinction between liquid and gas, and the molecules stop pulling on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

Once the vessel was depressurized, the solid skeleton – that 1% of the gel's mass – remained intact, with its pores now filled with gas instead of liquid. This nanoporous solid is what is known as [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Kistler published his findings in the journal *Nature* in 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

Kistler experimented with various materials, creating aerogels from eggs, rubber, nitrocellulose, and silica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

## Modern Aerogel Production

Today, a common process involves using wet silica gel, which is roughly 97% alcohol within its pores, and 3% amorphous silica solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. This wet gel is very easy to break and crumbly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

The next step is to replace the alcohol with liquid carbon dioxide (CO₂), which is advantageous because it is non-flammable and has a low critical temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Once the liquid CO₂ has filled all the pores, it is heated to its supercritical state. As it approaches the critical point, the surface of the liquid becomes blurry, and eventually disappears, indicating the formation of the supercritical fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

In this supercritical state, the CO₂ can be vented without causing the solid structure to collapse, leaving behind the [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Future [[development_and_future_applications_of_aerogel | Applications]]

Original silica [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] is hydrophilic, meaning it absorbs water, which can ruin its structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. However, scientists are working on making it waterproof and improving its durability and elasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. These advancements could lead to more widespread [[applications_and_uses_of_aerogel | everyday uses for aerogel]], such as highly efficient [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | thermal insulation]] in buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

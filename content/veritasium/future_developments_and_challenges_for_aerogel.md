Despite its remarkable [[properties_of_aerogel | properties]], aerogel faces challenges in widespread adoption, primarily related to cost and durability. However, ongoing research aims to address these issues and expand its [[practical_applications_of_aerogel | practical applications]].

## Challenges of Aerogel

### Brittleness
One significant challenge is the inherent brittleness of original silica aerogel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. While some elasticity has been introduced, it is still "not hard to break" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a> and can be "very crumbly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This brittleness can make it challenging to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Hydrophilicity
Original silica aerogel is hydrophilic, meaning it readily absorbs water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Once a hydrophilic aerogel gets wet, it is "pretty much" ruined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Cost
Scientists are actively working on reducing the costs associated with aerogel production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Future Developments

### Increased Durability and Waterproofing
Significant progress has been made in increasing aerogel's durability, with some forms exhibiting elasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Additionally, methods have been developed to make aerogel waterproof, addressing the issue of hydrophilicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Research continues into "next generation aerogels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Expanding Thermal Insulation Applications
Due to its superior [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | thermal insulation capabilities]], aerogel is envisioned for more widespread use where thermal efficiency is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. For instance, in extremely cold environments, aerogel could replace much thicker conventional insulation, such as fiberglass, offering significant space savings (e.g., six inches of aerogel instead of ten feet of fiberglass) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### Space Technology and Exploration
NASA continues to rely on aerogel for future space missions, particularly to Mars, for insulating electronics against the cold Martian nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. It has been used on past rovers like Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Simulating a microgravity environment can be achieved through specific aircraft maneuvers, such as the "vomit comet," which flies in a series of parabolic arcs to create freefall conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This allows for brief periods of microgravity, typically around 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Such planes can also simulate the gravity of other celestial bodies, like the Moon and Mars, by modifying the parabola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Physiological Effects of Microgravity

### Muscle Atrophy and Bone Density Loss

A significant challenge in low gravity environments is the difficulty of [[exercising_and_maintaining_health_in_low_gravity_environments | exercising]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. On Earth, the simple act of lifting an arm provides a minor workout due to its weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. In microgravity, this effect is absent, and on Mars, it's only a fraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. During long-duration spaceflights, such as a journey to Mars or living on the International Space Station, muscles can weaken and shrink, a process known as atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Studies have shown that muscle mass can decrease by up to 20% in spaceflights lasting only 5 to 11 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Traditional weightlifting is ineffective in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Instead, astronauts must rely on elastic resistance training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. For instance, on the space station, astronauts are elastically tethered to a treadmill and typically [[exercising_and_maintaining_health_in_low_gravity_environments | exercise]] two and a half hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Even with [[exercising_and_maintaining_health_in_low_gravity_environments | exercise]], the absence of weight pushing on bones leads to a decrease in bone density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Astronauts can lose 1-2% of bone mass per month, primarily in their lower extremities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This rate is over ten times faster than the bone loss experienced by people on Earth due to osteoporosis as they age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Challenges with Everyday Activities

In weightless conditions, other forces, such as the surface tension of water, become significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This makes everyday activities considerably more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Dealing with liquids in microgravity is particularly difficult, making tasks like washing one's face, showering, brushing teeth, and using the bathroom much harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Sensory and Perceptual Changes

Humans are not necessarily evolved to be in different gravity situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This can lead to nausea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. After 50 parabolas in a microgravity simulation, one might struggle to avoid losing their breakfast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Astronauts also report seeing flashes of light, even with their eyes closed, when not yet asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. These flashes are believed to be a human body reaction to [[effects_of_cosmic_rays_on_aviation_and_space_missions | radiation]] from the universe, likely heavy particles or individual bursts of energy passing through the eyeball or optic nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Unexpected Physical Phenomena

In the absence of Earth's gravity, strange effects can be observed. For example, when spinning a disc, it demonstrates the intermediate axis theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This phenomenon has also been observed on the space station with a t-bar handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The theorem states that rotation about an intermediate axis (not the least or greatest moment of inertia) is unstable, meaning any tiny disturbance will cause it to rotate about another axis as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Mitigation Strategies

While a journey to Mars would involve experiencing eight months of microgravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, challenges like muscle and bone loss can be mitigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. For instance, wearing a spacesuit on Mars, which can weigh up to 310 pounds, could make a person feel as heavy as they are on Earth, thereby helping maintain muscle and bone mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

Regarding [[effects_of_cosmic_rays_on_aviation_and_space_missions | radiation]], shielding can be incorporated into the ship's insulation, and water is a terrific radiation absorber that can be used to shield the vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. These difficulties are seen not as deal-breakers but as challenges to overcome for humanity to become a multi-planetary species and guarantee long-term survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

A US government warehouse sells an astonishing variety of items, from the mundane to the truly bizarre <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This inventory includes blueberries, steel, cigarettes, limestone, standard bullets, and even domestic sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The sheer variety of items, some of which seem fictional, leads to questions about their purpose and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## What's Inside the Warehouse?

The warehouse stores nearly 1300 different standard reference materials (SRMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. It operates as a business, running a $20 million operation within the federal government, selling about 30,000 units annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Half of these sales are domestic, and half are international <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. All products and their prices are listed on `shop.nist.gov` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Unexpected Food Standards

Perhaps one of the weirdest items sold is peanut butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This specific jar of peanut butter is arguably the most expensive in the world, costing around a thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. It is not for human consumption, as it is very old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The process involves commissioning a company to make generic peanut butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) then meticulously measure the quantities of all compounds, including fats, and identify them with specified uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This makes it a Standard Reference Material (SRM), mixed thoroughly to ensure consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. What buyers are truly paying for is the precise knowledge of the peanut butter's exact composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

SRM peanut butter is used by researchers and manufacturers to calibrate their equipment, ensuring accuracy in measuring nutrient values and detecting contaminants like aflatoxins (carcinogens produced by fungi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) often encourages commercial laboratories to use SRMs for accurate measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

NIST also provides standards for other foods, such as:
*   Mussel, dolphin, whale, bird, and human tissue samples preserved in liquid nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   A "standard trout" as a surrogate for other fish types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   "Meat Homogenate," a thoroughly mixed and ground meat product, often a blend of chicken and pork, created based on industry needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   A "typical diet" mix, which is a freeze-dried powder representing the average American's dietary components, including sugars, proteins, vitamins, and fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

NIST sells around 30 different food items, categorized by their position on a "food triangle" based on carbohydrate, fat, and protein content, allowing manufacturers to choose a standard material that closely matches their target product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Material and Product Standards

NIST's historical role in standards began with steel. In the early 1900s, issues with steel quality in rail cars led Congress to mandate the National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now NIST) to create standard steel samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. These standards, analyzed for all constituent elements like chrome, iron, and carbon, allowed foundries to compare their results and ensure consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Steel remains one of NIST's most important SRMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

The best-selling product at NIST is called "Charpies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. These are standard pieces of metal with a V-notch used in a Charpy impact test to measure steel strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Companies globally are required to annually check their materials against NIST's Charpies, especially for steels used in pipelines, defense industries, and nuclear waste storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Approximately 8,000 Charpies are sold annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

NIST continues to sell its very first standard sample, Limestone Number One, which is a gray powder created 110 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. It remains popular, with 40 to 50 units sold annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

Other unexpected product standards include:
*   **Standard Cigarettes:** Used in ASTM tests to determine the flammability of furniture, bed clothes, or mattresses, helping to prevent fires started by smoking materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Standard Bullets:** These manufactured bullets have standard, replicated marks (nano-indentations) that mimic rifling grooves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Forensic labs use them to validate their equipment for accurately measuring grooves to match crime scene bullets to suspected weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Environmental and Biological Standards

Identifying dangerous contaminants is a significant purpose of SRMs. NIST provides standards for:
*   **House Dust:** Collected from vacuum bags in hotels and homes, mixed thoroughly, and measured for chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. It's used for environmental monitoring to understand exposure to chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Lead Paint:** Several types are available to help detect this hazardous material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Glacier Water from Greenland:** A rare sample with limited distribution (one unit per customer every three years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   **Dirt from New Jersey and Montana:** Soil samples from contaminated industrial sites, certified for toxic elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Domestic Sludge:** This dried wastewater treatment solid is a record of what passes through our sewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Researchers examine it for traces of toxins or heavy metals, which helps with environmental monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
*   **Human Poop Product (upcoming):** Set to launch next year, this will be a vial of powder to support measurements of metabolites related to the human microbiome and gut health, an incredibly difficult matrix to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

As knowledge evolves, so do the SRMs. NIST is preparing to launch its first living standard reference material: hamster ovary cells that produce monoclonal antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. In 2022, NIST rapidly created a positive control reference of monkeypox DNA within 30 days to aid disease diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

## The Importance of Standards

The ultimate goal of every standard is to quantify something important and often difficult to measure about the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. These standards are used for both calibration (ensuring equipment works properly) and validation (ensuring consistency in industry tests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

Behind the scenes, a dedicated group at NIST tirelessly ensures that various aspects of our world align with established standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. This work provides assurance that:
*   Peanut butter labels accurately reflect their contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
*   Blood test results are reliably calibrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
*   Steel-framed buildings possess the necessary structural integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

This unseen network of standards ensures that our complex world functions reliably and safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

Blackbird is a one-of-a-kind propeller craft built to settle a [[physics_of_windpowered_vehicles | physics debate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its creators claim it can travel directly downwind faster than the wind itself, a feat that appears counterintuitive and seems to violate the law of conservation of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The vehicle was tested at El Mirage, a dry lakebed a few hours from Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Downwind Paradox
The debate centers on whether any wind-powered vehicle can go directly downwind faster than the wind itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Sailboats** operating directly downwind cannot exceed wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. As a sailboat matches the wind's speed, there is no longer any apparent wind to push the sail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   However, sailboats can go faster than the wind if they travel at an angle to it, a process known as tacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. In this scenario, the sail acts like a wing, generating lift perpendicular to the apparent wind, with a component of this force driving the boat forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Some boats can achieve speeds three or four times the wind speed this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This allows them to have a resulting velocity directly downwind that is faster than the wind itself, theoretically beating a drifting balloon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

The Blackbird's unique claim is that it can go straight downwind faster than the air pushing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## How Blackbird Works
[[blackbird_vehicle_mechanics_and_operation | Blackbird's operation]] is counterintuitive:
*   The vehicle starts moving forward due to the wind pushing its "bluff body" (its general shape) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   As the wheels turn from this forward motion, they are geared to the propeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   Crucially, the gearing causes the propeller to spin *opposite* to the direction the wind would naturally push it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   Instead of acting like a windmill (which is pushed by the wind), the propeller functions as a fan, actively pushing air backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This backward thrust drives the craft forwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   Even when the vehicle reaches wind speed, the propeller can continue to push air backward, generating thrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   The energy for this thrust comes from the wind itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. The propeller extracts energy from the tailwind, slowing down the air behind it (e.g., from 10 km/h to 8 km/h) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. This extracted energy is then converted into the kinetic energy of the cart, accelerating it beyond wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
*   When the vehicle is moving faster than the wind, the telltale string (a piece of string at the front of the vehicle used to show wind direction) will flip around and point forward, indicating an apparent headwind, even though the true wind is coming from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Design and Operation
The vehicle is described as feeling "makeshift" and "unbalanced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Seating**: The driver sits in a very reclined position, supported by a mesh hammock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Controls**:
    *   Steering is managed with the right hand: push to go left, pull to go right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   The pitch of the propeller blades is controlled with the left hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   Braking commands were confusing, with experts disagreeing on the correct action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Propeller Issues**: During testing, the propeller chain came off, requiring repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Excessive vibration of the propeller was also a concern, leading to fears it might break apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Wind Conditions**: A minimum wind speed of 8-10 miles per hour is considered healthy for operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Winds around 15 mph were deemed potentially too high for safe operation due to vehicle instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## Validation and Record
Initially, many people, including physics professors, doubted the possibility of Blackbird's claim, believing it violated fundamental [[physics_and_aerodynamic_principles | physics and aerodynamic principles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   A small model of Blackbird was tested on a treadmill, demonstrating its capability, though skeptics claimed the treadmill wasn't a good analog or that there were hidden fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   The full-scale Blackbird vehicle successfully demonstrated its ability to travel faster than the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   The creators of Blackbird achieved a record speed of 2.8 times the wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. This practical demonstration confirms that it is physically possible for a vehicle to drive downwind faster than the wind itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

Travel to Mars or other deep-space destinations would expose astronauts to significant amounts of [[effects_of_cosmic_rays_on_aviation_and_space_missions | radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This is a major challenge that needs to be addressed for human long-term survival as a multi-planetary species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Physiological Effects of Radiation

Astronauts on orbit occasionally experience a strange phenomenon: when their eyes are closed, but they are not yet asleep, they may see a flash of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This is believed to be a [[health_impacts_of_radiation_exposure | human body reaction]] to [[effects_of_cosmic_rays_on_aviation_and_space_missions | radiation]] from the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

It is thought that these flashes are caused by [[understanding_ionizing_radiation | heavy particles or individual bursts of energy]] from [[effects_of_cosmic_rays_on_aviation_and_space_missions | radiation]] passing through the eyeball itself or the optic nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

> "I can just imagine the first two guys that said hey, I am sometimes I see flashes of light do you see flashes of light and then oh, we all see flashes alike. Oh okay, well that's that's alright then." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>

## Radiation Shielding

Protecting against radiation exposure is considered a solvable challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. It is possible to shield a spacecraft from [[effects_of_cosmic_rays_on_aviation_and_space_missions | radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Methods include:
*   Integrating shielding material into the ship's insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   Using water as a "terrific radiation absorber" to shield the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

However, radiation cannot be ignored as a factor in space travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Astronauts undertaking long-duration space missions, such as a trip to Mars, would be exposed to significant amounts of radiation in addition to [[challenges_of_microgravity_in_space_travel | dealing with microgravity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Effects of Radiation on the Human Body

Astronauts on orbit occasionally report seeing flashes of light even with their eyes closed, when they are not yet asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This phenomenon is considered a human body reaction to radiation from the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Scientists believe these flashes are caused by heavy particles or individual bursts of energy from radiation passing through the eyeball itself or the optic nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

"I picture back to the first astronauts who must have closed their eyes and seen that radiation and going, 'I'm not going to tell anybody about this because no one's told me about it. I'm not talking.' I can just imagine the first two guys that said, 'Hey, I am sometimes I see flashes of light. Do you see flashes of light?' And then, 'Oh, we all see flashes alike. Oh, okay, well that's that's alright then.'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>

## Radiation Shielding

While radiation exposure is a serious concern, it is considered a challenge to be overcome rather than a deal-breaker for human space travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Shielding a spacecraft from radiation is feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Methods include incorporating shielding into the ship's insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Water is also a highly effective radiation absorber and can be used to shield the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. However, the issue of radiation exposure cannot be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Ocean waves are primarily generated by wind, and their characteristics are influenced by five factors: wind speed, wind duration, the distance over which the wind acts (known as the fetch), the width of the fetch, and the depth of the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

The U.S. Navy's Indoor Ocean at Carderock, the world's largest [[navy_ship_testing_facilities | wave pool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, is used to replicate various [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave]] conditions encountered in different parts of the world's oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>, allowing engineers to test scale ship designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Characteristics of Ocean Waves

### Swell
As [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] travel away from a storm, higher frequency [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] dissipate their energy more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. The [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] that travel long distances are fast-moving, low-frequency [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] known as swell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. For example, long-period swell can originate hundreds of miles away in the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. Swell, characterized by long wavelengths, is generally not a concern for ships in the open ocean; instead, the steeper, windy [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] pose more of a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. This behavior is analogous to sound waves, where low frequencies travel much further than high frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

### Rogue Waves
Rogue [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] are typically not a singular phenomenon, but rather the result of multiple [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] converging and creating an amplitude significantly larger than that of an individual [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. When such a large [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave]] forms, its height can exceed one-seventh of its wavelength, causing it to break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

### Wind Waves
Wind [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] form in three stages:
1.  **Ripples** Turbulent air motion over calm water creates slight pressure differences, forming tiny ripples with wavelengths around a centimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.
2.  **Growth** The wind interacts with these ripples, creating larger pressure differences between the front and top of the [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave]] crest, which pulls them into bigger [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. The ongoing interaction further amplifies these pressure differences, leading to even larger [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. Initially, these [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] are mostly uniform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.
3.  **Developed Sea** As [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] interact with each other, they generate a range of different wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. Continuous wind causes these [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] to break, transferring their kinetic energy into swirling eddies that dissipate energy as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. When the rate of energy dissipation equals the energy input from the wind, the [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] reach their maximum size, resulting in a fully developed sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

## Regional Variations in Ocean Conditions
Different oceans worldwide exhibit distinct mixtures of [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave]] frequencies, or spectra, influenced by their unique geography and storm patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.

*   **North Sea and small bodies of water** These regions typically have a peakier spectrum due to the limited fetch of their storms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>.
*   **Mid-Atlantic** This area is characterized by a broader spectrum, which best describes its developing or decaying open ocean [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.
*   **North Atlantic** Known for steady winds across an open ocean, this region produces the broadest spectrum of wind [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>.

When testing ship models at facilities like the [[navy_ship_testing_facilities | Navy's Indoor Ocean]], engineers first identify the ship's intended deployment location and then create the corresponding [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave]] spectra in the pool to accurately simulate real-world conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. Experiences of sailors confirm these differences; for instance, the coast of South Korea in spring can have very rough sea conditions, while crossing the Pacific is often much calmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>.

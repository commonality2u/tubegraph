The [[applications_of_the_magnus_effect|Magnus effect]] is a phenomenon that explains how rotating objects, such as balls or cylinders, generate a force perpendicular to their direction of motion as they fly through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This effect causes the object to curve away from the path it would otherwise follow.

## Observation at Gordon Dam
The effect was notably demonstrated when a basketball was dropped from the 126.5-meter (415 feet) high Gordon Dam in Tasmania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
A basketball dropped without spin landed almost directly below the drop point, only slightly influenced by the breeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. However, when another basketball was dropped with backspin, it dramatically took off horizontally, moving far from its expected vertical path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This unexpected flight path was a direct result of the [[applications_of_the_magnus_effect|Magnus effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## How the Magnus Effect Works
The [[applications_of_the_magnus_effect|Magnus effect]] occurs due to the interaction between the spinning object and the air surrounding it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
1.  As the basketball picks up speed, air on the side of the ball rotating in the same direction as the ball's spin is dragged along with the ball and deflected backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
2.  On the opposite side, where the ball's surface is moving against the direction of the airflow, the flow separates from the ball instead of being deflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
3.  The net result is that the ball pushes air in one direction, and according to Newton's third law, the air applies an equal and opposite force on the ball in the other direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This force is what causes the object to curve.

## History
The effect is named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus, who provided a description of it in 1852 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, Isaac Newton had described the flight of tennis balls at Cambridge College nearly two hundred years prior, also observing this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Applications
The [[applications_of_the_magnus_effect|Magnus effect]] is crucial in various sports, influencing the flight of balls in tennis, soccer, and golf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Beyond sports, there are several [[non_sport_uses_of_magnus_effect|non-sport applications of the Magnus effect]]:

*   **Flettner Rotors on Ships**: Some sailboats utilize spinning cylinders called "Flettner rotors" instead of traditional sails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. These rotors use the [[applications_of_the_magnus_effect|Magnus effect]] to deflect crosswinds and propel the ship forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. An example is the E-Ship 1, which incorporates four Flettner rotors to enhance its efficiency and reduce diesel consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Experimental Aircraft**:
    *   Early attempts included a plane designed with spinning cylinders instead of wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. While these cylinders could generate more lift than conventional wings using the [[applications_of_the_magnus_effect|Magnus effect]], they also produced significantly more drag, making the design impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This particular plane only flew once before crashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   More recently, the [[applications_of_the_magnus_effect|Magnus effect]] has seen a comeback in aeronautics with experimental rotor wing aircraft that generate all their lift from spinning cylinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

In the future, the [[applications_of_the_magnus_effect|Magnus effect]] may contribute to more than just the flight of basketballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

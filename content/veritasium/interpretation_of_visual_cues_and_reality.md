Our perception of reality is constantly influenced by the way our brains interpret visual cues, often leading to spectacular illusions that defy what is truly happening in the physical world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This phenomenon highlights how our brains prioritize certain interpretations over actual external reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

## The [[ames_window_illusion | Ames Window Illusion]]

The [[ames_window_illusion | Ames window illusion]] is a classic optical illusion where a continuously rotating window appears to oscillate back and forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This illusion was created by Adelbert Ames in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

Key features of the [[ames_window_illusion | Ames window illusion]]:
*   **Trapezoidal Shape** The window is not a rectangle but a trapezoid, with one side significantly shorter than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This shape is essential for the illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
*   **Shading** It is shaded to appear three-dimensional, but it is actually a two-dimensional card with the same image on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

Even when aware of the window's true shape and continuous rotation, many people, including the presenter, still perceive it as oscillating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Adding an object like a Rubik's Cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a> or a ruler through the window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a> only makes the perceived movement more bizarre, appearing to defy physical laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

### The Carpentered Environment Hypothesis

According to Adelbert Ames, a key to understanding this illusion is our constant experience living in "carpentered environments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Houses, rooms, doors, windows, tables, and chairs are full of 90-degree angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Although the images forming on our retinas are often trapezoidal, our brains, through extensive experience, assume these shapes should be rectangles with right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. This assumption allows our brains to infer depth information, which is usually correct in our rectilinear world, but fails with a trapezoidal window that our brains assume is rectangular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

To test this hypothesis, Harvard psychologists conducted a study in South Africa in 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>:
*   **Urban Group** 40 children from Durban, accustomed to rectangular buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. 60% of this group saw the window oscillating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Rural Group** 40 children from rural communities, living in round huts with few 90-degree angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Only 17.5% of this group saw the oscillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

These results supported the carpentered environment hypothesis, suggesting that less exposure to rectangles made children less susceptible to the illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

However, when viewed from 20 feet away with one eye closed, 90% of all participants saw the window oscillating, with no significant difference between urban and rural groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. This indicates that other factors beyond experience with rectangles contribute to the illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. The de Heer circle, which has no straight lines, also appears to oscillate when continuously rotating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

## Anamorphosis

Both the [[ames_window_illusion | Ames window illusion]] and the de Heer circle utilize **anamorphosis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>, a technique that creates a distorted projection of an object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. To perceive the object's proper proportions, it must be viewed from a specific position or with a particular device, like a mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

Examples of anamorphosis include:
*   **"The Ambassadors" (1533) by Hans Holbein the Younger** This painting features a distorted shape on the floor that only reveals a human skull when viewed from the top right or bottom left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. It's believed to be intended for a stairwell, allowing viewers to glimpse the skull and be reminded of mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   **Leonardo's Eye by Leonardo da Vinci** This earlier example takes its proper form only when viewed from the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.
*   **Lascaux cave paintings (17,000 years ago)** Some argue these might be the first examples of anamorphic art, as artists would have considered how their figures appeared from different vantage points on uneven surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

## The [[Ames Room and depth perception | Ames Room]]

Anamorphosis is also central to Ames's most famous illusion, the [[Ames Room and depth perception | Ames Room]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. Ames designed his first distortive room in 1934 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.

How an [[Ames Room and depth perception | Ames Room]] is constructed:
1.  An ordinary rectangular room has a diagonal wall added through its middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
2.  Lines connecting key parts of the room (corners, windows) are drawn to a specific "privileged viewpoint" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
3.  Where these lines intersect the diagonal wall, a floor and ceiling are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. These will appear tilted and warped if the projection is done correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
4.  Connecting the floor and ceiling with trapezoidal walls completes the [[Ames Room and depth perception | Ames Room]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

When viewed with one eye from this privileged perspective, the [[Ames Room and depth perception | Ames Room]] appears to be an ordinary rectangular room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. However, when people move within the room, the illusion breaks, revealing that something is not right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

Ames recognized that an infinite number of distorted room geometries could produce virtually identical images of a normal room when viewed from the privileged position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. This demonstrates that our perceptions are not transparently representing external reality but are constantly faced with ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. Our brains subconsciously decide which of the infinite possibilities we are looking at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

### Depth Perception

Ambiguity often relates to depth perception, where our brains are subconsciously attuned to visual cues like size, brightness, and occlusion to determine how close or far something is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Illusions exploit these cues to defy expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. For the [[ames_window_illusion | Ames window illusion]], when the larger side of the trapezoid is further away, our brain still perceives it as closer because of its larger size in our field of view, causing the window to appear to rotate in the opposite direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.

Studies on babies have shown that the ability to interpret depth cues seems to be an innate ability that forms very early in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. When shown the [[ames_window_illusion | Ames window illusion]], babies aged seven and a half and nine months showed significantly more interest in the illusion than five and a half month olds, suggesting they perceived it as oscillating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications

These illusions highlight a significant misconception about science: that competing theories can be easily resolved by simply "looking at the data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. In reality, the same data can often stem from very different external realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>.

For instance:
*   The observation of the sun moving across the sky doesn't inherently resolve whether the sun goes around the Earth or the Earth rotates on its axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.
*   When a quantum measurement is made, data does not discriminate between whether the wave function collapses or if the universe branches (as in the [[many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.
*   The data does not yet differentiate whether the speed of light is truly the same in all directions or if only the roundtrip speed is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>.

The Ames illusions serve as a powerful metaphor for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. We feel we can directly perceive external reality, much like a person looking into an [[Ames Room and depth perception | Ames Room]], but in truth, there are infinite geometries that could look the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. In a world where people receive the same information but arrive at vastly different conclusions about reality, it's crucial to remember that our brains can be fooled by simple rotating images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>. This calls for approaching the world and our conclusions with greater humility and less certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.

The [[magnus_effect_on_a_basketball | Magnus effect]] is a phenomenon that impacts all rotating balls or cylinders as they fly through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. It is particularly important in sports where spin is applied to a ball to influence its trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Demonstration at Gordon Dam
A striking [[realworld_experiments_and_simulations_demonstrating_the_effect | real-world demonstration]] of the Magnus effect was conducted at the Gordon Dam in Tasmania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The dam is 126.5 meters (415 feet) high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. When a basketball was simply dropped over the edge, it was slightly pushed by the breeze but landed directly below where it was dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

However, when another basketball was dropped with a bit of backspin, it dramatically took off horizontally, moving far from its original drop point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The person who dropped it noted they "didn't even throw it" and "had no idea that was gonna do that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## How the Magnus Effect Works
As a basketball (or any rotating object) picks up speed through the air, the Magnus effect comes into play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>:
*   On the side of the ball where the air is moving in the same direction as the ball's spin, the air gets dragged along with the ball and is deflected backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   On the opposite side, where the air is moving against the ball's spin, the flow separates from the ball rather than being deflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The net result is that the ball pushes air in one direction, causing the air to apply an equal and opposite force on the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This force is what causes the ball to curve or lift.

## History
The effect is named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus, who provided a description of it in 1852 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. However, Isaac Newton had described the flight of tennis balls at Cambridge College nearly two hundred years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Applications in Sports
The Magnus effect is very important in various sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, including:
*   Tennis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   Soccer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   Golf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>

## Beyond Sports
While crucial in sports, the Magnus effect also has [[non_sport_applications_of_the_magnus_effect | non-sport applications]]. For example, Flettner rotors are spinning cylinders that can replace sails on ships to propel them forward by deflecting crosswinds using the Magnus effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. There have also been experimental planes that use spinning cylinders instead of wings to generate lift, though they often produce too much drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Modern vessels like the E-Ship 1 utilize Flettner rotors to enhance efficiency and reduce fuel consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

The Great Pyramid stood as the tallest man-made structure for almost 4,000 years, only surpassed by the Eiffel Tower in 1889 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These impressive structures were constructed over 4,500 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Builders

Contrary to popular belief, recent discoveries suggest that the [[myths_and_misconceptions_about_pyramid_builders | pyramid builders]] were not slaves, but skilled workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Well-preserved tombs found near the pyramids indicate that their strenuous labor and sacrifices were recognized and honored with burials, which would not have been afforded to slaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Materials Used

The construction of a single pyramid, like the Great Pyramid, involved approximately 2 million stones, or "giant rocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Each of these stones weighed between 1.5 and 3 tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

*   **Internal Stones**: The interior of the pyramid was primarily constructed from Limestone, a softer and more workable stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Exterior Casing**: The entire outer face of the pyramid was covered with a brighter white limestone, giving it a smooth, white finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Harder Stones**: The exterior, particularly for certain sections, utilized much harder granite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This granite was quarried in Aswan, nearly 1,000 kilometers away from Giza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Capstones**: The very top of the pyramid may have been covered with electrum, an alloy of gold and silver, creating a spectacular, shiny metallic pinnacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Tools and Resources**: At the time of construction, Egyptians did not have wheels or steel; copper and copper alloys were the only available metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Construction Techniques

The construction of the pyramids is a subject of ongoing speculation, with no surviving plans to detail the methods used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. It took an estimated 20 to 30 years to build a single pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, requiring a stone to be laid roughly every 3 minutes during a typical workday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Site Preparation
Before building, the ground needed to be meticulously leveled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. One theory suggests that during the Nile's flood season, water was channeled onto the site to identify high parts of the ground, which would then be leveled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Stone Extraction and Shaping
*   **Limestone**: Softer limestone was likely worked with copper chisels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Some blocks may have been sawed using copper saws in conjunction with an abrasive like sand to wear away the stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This would have been an extremely labor-intensive process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Granite**: Granite, being one of the hardest rocks due to its quartz content (a 7 on the hardness scale where diamond is a 10), posed a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The technique for quarrying granite involved repeatedly smashing dolerite rock into the granite, achieving a progress of only about 5 mm per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Transporting Materials
*   **Land Transport**: The Egyptians did not use wheels or even rollers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Stones were transported across the desert on sleds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Experiments have shown that wetting the sand in front of the sled reduced the required pulling force by half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For example, a giant statue weighing around 68 tons would have been pulled by 172 men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Water Transport**: During the Nile's flood season, granite quarried in Aswan could be moved to Giza via rafts on the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Lifting and Placement
While the exact method for raising the massive stones is debated, the best guess involves the use of ramps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Some ramp structures have been found on incomplete pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. However, a single long, straight ramp would be impractical, as it would require more material than the pyramid itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. A more likely theory suggests a ramp that wrapped around the pyramid as it grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. For the upper levels, particularly the top third which accounts for only about 4% of the pyramid's material, it is suspected that levers were used to finish the construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## [[visual_and_cultural_significance_of_pyramids | Appearance]]
In the past, the pyramids would have appeared as a bright white, reflecting the sun, with a smooth, white finish on all sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The shape of the pyramids was designed to represent sun rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. With a shiny, metallic capstone, the completed pyramids would have been a truly spectacular sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

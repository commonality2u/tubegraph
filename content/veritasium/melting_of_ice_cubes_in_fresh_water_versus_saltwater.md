When identical ice cubes are placed in cups of fresh water and saltwater at room temperature, the ice cube in fresh water will melt faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This observation might seem counterintuitive, as salt is commonly used on roads to melt ice more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Experimental Setup and Initial Observations
To conduct this experiment, identical ice cubes are placed into two separate cups: one filled with regular fresh water and the other with saltwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. When salt (sodium chloride) is initially added to water, it takes energy to dissolve, which can temporarily lower the solution's temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. For a fair comparison, the saltwater solution is allowed to return to room temperature before the ice cubes are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

After placing the ice cubes, it becomes apparent that the ice cube in the fresh water melts more rapidly than the one in the saltwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## The Role of Density and Convection
The difference in melting rates is due to the density of the melted water and the resulting convection currents:

*   **In Fresh Water:** As the ice cube melts, the cold fresh water coming off the ice is denser than the surrounding warmer fresh water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This denser, cold water descends in the glass, pulling warmer fresh water up to meet the ice cube, thereby melting it faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This creates a continuous convection current that facilitates heat transfer. Clear currents of cold water can be seen streaming down to the bottom of the cup in the fresh water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

*   **In Saltwater:** When the ice cube melts in saltwater, the fresh water that melts off the ice cube is *less dense* than the surrounding saltwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Because it's less dense, this cold, melted water stays around the ice cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This layer of cold, fresh water effectively insulates the ice cube from the warmer saltwater around it, slowing down the melting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The cold water does not go deep into the cup on the saltwater side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

A demonstration using colored ice cubes can visually confirm these currents, showing the distinct downward flow in fresh water and the stationary cold layer in saltwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

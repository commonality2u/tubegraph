Success is often attributed to hard work, talent, and determination, but an often-underestimated factor is luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. A natural human tendency, known as egocentric bias, leads individuals to overestimate their own contributions and underestimate the impact of external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. This bias makes it difficult to fully grasp the [[Acknowledging fortune and promoting generosity | influence of other things]] like chance on one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.

## Egocentric Bias: Why We Overestimate Ourselves

The egocentric bias is evident in various scenarios:
*   A viral headline during the COVID lockdown showed that nearly half of men claimed to do most of the homeschooling, while only 3% of women agreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   Authors of multi-author papers, when asked what percentage of work they personally did, collectively sum up to an average of 140% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   Couples asked about housework consistently exceed 100% when their estimates are combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Even when asked about negative contributions, like starting fights or making messes, couples' combined totals still exceed 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

This phenomenon isn't due to a desire to appear more helpful, but rather because individuals vividly experience and remember all of their own actions, while not fully perceiving or recalling what others do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. This natural overestimation of one's own contributions leads to an underestimation of external influences, including luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.

## How Luck Manifests in Success

Luck can play a significant, often unacknowledged, role in achieving success:

### The "Birthday Advantage" in Sports
In hockey, a significant percentage of players selected into top-tier leagues are born in the first quarter of the year (often 40%), compared to only 10% in the fourth quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This is because the cutoff date for youth leagues is typically January 1st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Those born early in the year are slightly older, and thus on average bigger and faster, than their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This initial advantage leads to more ice time, more tournaments, and better coaching, compounding year after year until it results in a skewed distribution of birthdays in professional leagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Professional hockey players typically do not feel thankful for their birth month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### Country of Birth
A major factor in a person's income is their country of residence and its income distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. For example, being born in a country with a very low gross national income per capita, like Burundi, makes it unlikely to earn much as an adult, regardless of individual intelligence or hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### World Records and Competitive Fields
Even world-class athletes, who are undeniably talented and dedicated, often benefit from luck when setting world records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. For instance, seven out of eight track and field world records were achieved with a tailwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. While ability is crucial, setting a record often requires a bit of fortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

In fields with high [[Impact of competition on success | competition]] and few available positions, such as becoming a NASA astronaut, luck's importance significantly increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. A model assuming astronaut selection is 95% skill/experience and 5% luck showed that in a simulation of 1,000 selections, the chosen astronauts had an average luck score of 94.7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. On average, only 1.6 of the 11 selected astronauts would have been in the top 11 based on skill alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. This means that even with a small luck component, 9 or 10 of the 11 selected individuals would have been different without luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

## Why We Overlook Our Good Fortune

### The "Useful Delusion"
Overlooking good luck can paradoxically increase the probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. If one perceives an outcome as uncertain, they are less likely to invest effort, thereby decreasing their chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Believing oneself to be in full control of destiny can be a "useful delusion" that encourages perseverance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

### Justifying Status and Inequality
Ignoring lucky breaks also makes it easier to justify one's place in society, especially for those with wealth or power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. They can attribute success solely to their own intelligence, effort, and perseverance, which facilitates the acceptance of inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

In one experiment, randomly designated team leaders in a group discussion received an extra cookie, despite having no special aptitude or extra responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. This suggests that once a certain status is achieved, it feels natural to feel deserving of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Research also supports that attributing success to personal qualities can lead to less generosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. Participants who listed personal attributes for a good outcome donated 25% less to charity than those who listed external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

## The Consequences of Survivor Bias

Business leaders and politicians, while undoubtedly talented and hard-working, have often been luckier than most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. Their "survivor bias" means they've experienced hard work leading to success, making the world appear fair to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. They lack the experience of those who worked hard and failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. This can lead to the conclusion that less successful people are simply less talented or less hard-working, which in turn makes them less inclined to be [[Acknowledging fortune and promoting generosity | generous]] or give back to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. This is particularly unfortunate as a significant source of luck for many is their country of residence, which is built on the contributions of those who came before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

## The Benefits of Acknowledging Luck

Acknowledging fortunate circumstances not only aligns one's perception more closely with reality but also makes individuals more likeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. A study found that an entrepreneur who attributed success to luck was judged as kinder and more likely to be a close friend than one who took full personal credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. Raising awareness of fortunate events can also foster gratitude, leading to increased happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

## The Paradox of Success

For individuals aiming for success, a paradoxical approach is advised:
1.  **Believe in full control:** One must believe they are in complete control of their destiny and that success is solely due to talent and hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
2.  **Acknowledge luck:** Simultaneously, one must know that this belief is not entirely true for themselves or anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

If success is achieved, it is crucial to remember that luck played a significant role and, given that good fortune, one should strive to increase the luck of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

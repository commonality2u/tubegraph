The concept of [[the_different_sizes_of_infinity | different sizes of infinity]] is a profound mathematical idea, often explored through thought experiments like the Hilbert Hotel [00:00:01]. This hypothetical hotel possesses an infinite number of rooms, numbered sequentially from one onwards [00:00:06]. While it might seem capable of accommodating any number of guests, there are limits to even an infinite capacity [00:00:19].

## The Hilbert Hotel and Countable Infinity

As manager of the Hilbert Hotel, you are faced with various scenarios that demonstrate the unique properties of [[concept_of_countably_vs_uncountably_infinite | countably infinite]] sets:

### Accommodating New Guests
If all rooms are full with an infinite number of guests [00:00:30], and a new person arrives, a clever solution exists [00:00:40]. By asking every existing guest to move to the room number one greater than their current room (e.g., room 1 moves to 2, room 2 to 3, and so on) [00:00:50], room one becomes available for the new guest [00:00:58]. This method also works for a finite group of new guests, such as a bus with 100 people, by shifting all existing guests down 100 rooms [00:01:01].

### Infinite Buses
The hotel can even accommodate an infinitely long bus carrying infinitely many people [00:01:09]. To do this, existing guests are instructed to move to the room number double their current room (e.g., room 1 to 2, room 2 to 4) [00:01:25]. This opens up all odd-numbered rooms [00:01:37], of which there are infinitely many, allowing each person from the infinite bus to be assigned a unique odd-numbered room [00:01:44].

### Infinite Buses of Infinite Buses
The capacity of the Hilbert Hotel extends further. If an infinite number of infinite buses arrive [00:01:57], all new and existing guests can still be accommodated. This is achieved by creating an infinite grid, with rows representing the existing hotel guests and each bus, and columns representing their position within their respective vehicle [00:02:08]. By drawing a zigzag line across this grid, every unique individual can be assigned a position on a single, infinitely long line [00:02:41]. This line can then be mapped directly to the rooms in the hotel, ensuring everyone fits [00:03:03].

This ability to map all these infinite sets to the positive integers demonstrates that the number of rooms in the Hilbert Hotel is [[concept_of_countably_vs_uncountably_infinite | countably infinite]] [05:10]. This means there are as many rooms as there are positive integers (1, 2, 3...) [05:12].

## The Challenge of Uncountable Infinity

However, there is a limit to the Hilbert Hotel's capacity, revealing that [[the_different_sizes_of_infinity | some infinities are bigger than others]] [05:27]. This is demonstrated by an "infinite party bus" where each passenger is identified by a unique, infinitely long name consisting only of the letters 'A' and 'B' [00:03:15]. Every possible infinite sequence of these two letters exists as a passenger's name on this bus [00:03:40].

### Cantor's Diagonalization Argument
Despite the hotel's vast capacity, these guests cannot all be accommodated [00:03:54]. If one attempts to assign each hotel room to a unique name from the bus, even with an infinite list, a name can always be constructed that is not on that list [00:04:25]. This is done using a method called Cantor's diagonalization argument:
1.  Take the first letter of the name assigned to room one and flip it (A to B, or B to A) [00:04:33].
2.  Take the second letter of the name assigned to room two and flip it [00:04:39].
3.  Continue this process down the list for every room [00:04:43].

The new name created by this process is guaranteed to be different from every name on the list by at least one character (the one on the diagonal) [00:04:46]. This demonstrates that the number of people on this party bus is [[concept_of_countably_vs_uncountably_infinite | uncountably infinite]] [05:16]. If you try to match up each person with an integer (like a room number), you will always have people leftover [00:05:22].

## Real-World Implications

The discovery of [[the_different_sizes_of_infinity | different sized infinities]] by mathematicians was not merely an abstract concept. This line of inquiry ultimately led directly to the invention of the computer [05:41].

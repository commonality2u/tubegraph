Relativity Space, a startup, aims to [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | print an entire rocket]] including fuel tanks and engines, in just 60 days using the world's largest [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D metal printer]], named Stargate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This represents a significant shift from traditional rocket manufacturing methods.

## Traditional Rocket Production

Historically, rockets are massive, intricate engineering projects largely manufactured using conventional techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This approach necessitates building tools to construct the rocket itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Process and Complexity
For instance, to build NASA's Space Launch System (SLS), a 170-foot tall tool called the Vertical Assembly Center (VAC) was required for welding fuel tank sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Developing such custom tooling and validating its functionality is a time-consuming process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The SLS required 11 years of development before an assembly could reach the launch pad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Traditional rocket engines, like the Space Shuttle's main engines, involve thousands of individual components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. For example, the combustion chamber and nozzle previously required 1,080 small pipes to be individually formed and braze-welded together, a "ridiculously labor-intensive task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

Aerospace manufacturing has not widely adopted automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Rockets are often built one at a time by hand, comprising hundreds of thousands to millions of individual parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. This is partly due to the low volume of production, which provides less incentive to automate a factory for mass output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

## 3D Printed Rocket Production

Relativity Space's approach leverages [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | metal 3D printing]] to produce entire rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The process involves a wire melt team and a print head that uses plasma discharge to precisely control material deposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. An aluminum alloy wire is fed into the printer at about 10 inches per second, melted by lasers and plasma arc discharge at temperatures a few hundred degrees above aluminum's melting point of 660 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The entire rocket body is formed by melting tiny bits together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

For smaller, complex parts like the injector or nozzle, metal powder and lasers are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This process lays down very fine layers, approximately 1/20th the thickness of a human hair, relentlessly for about a week until the part is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### [[benefits_and_challenges_of_3d_printed_rockets | Benefits of 3D Printing]]

*   **Reduced Part Count**: One of the significant [[benefits_and_challenges_of_3d_printed_rockets | benefits of 3D printing]] is the reduction in the number of parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. For example, a rocket engine injector, traditionally made of over a thousand individual pieces, can be [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printed]] as a single component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Similarly, cooling channels for cryogenic propellants can be integrated directly into a [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printed]] rocket nozzle, eliminating the need for thousands of external pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. A [[benefits_and_challenges_of_3d_printed_rockets | fully 3D printed rocket]] can have 100 times fewer parts than a traditionally built one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Rapid Iteration and Manufacturing Speed**: The ability to build, test, and redesign parts quickly is a major advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Relativity Space, being five and a half years old, plans to launch its first rocket within the year, a stark contrast to the 11 years for SLS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. An engine injector takes only two weeks to print <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, and a whole engine can be built in about a month, allowing for rapid iterations and improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Cost Reduction**: Printing an injector is 10 times cheaper than traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Relativity aims to make rockets 5 to 100 times cheaper with [[future_prospects_of_3d_printing_in_space_exploration | fully reusable 3D printed rockets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   **Material Strength**: [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printed]] metals can be stronger than traditionally built ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This is achieved through custom alloys developed in-house and by taking advantage of the rapid melt and solidification physics principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Design Freedom**: The [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | impact of the 3D printing approach]] can fundamentally transform rocket design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Engineers can create smooth, curvy, and bio-inspired designs that would be impractical or impossible with traditional manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This allows for optimal structures that are not limited by traditional manufacturing constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Automation and Software Control**: [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printing is automation for aerospace]] because parts are "assembled" in the 3D file and then directly printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. The factory operates without fixed tooling, with part geometries controlled via CAD models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
    *   Relativity has developed software that "reverse warps" the part before printing to counteract material warping as it cools, ensuring a perfectly straight final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Challenges

While the benefits are significant, [[benefits_and_challenges_of_3d_printed_rockets | 3D printing]] can be initially frustrating, with early attempts resulting in "a pile of metal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The surface of a [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printed]] rocket may still show layers, though this roughness adds only 5-10% to the mass and causes no aerodynamic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Critical sections are machined afterwards to achieve a normal metal appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Relativity Space's long-term vision is to shrink this [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printing]] technology and its "factory of the future" down to a scale that can be launched to Mars, establishing an industrial base there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

Despite the promise, it is debated whether [[future_prospects_of_3d_printing_in_space_exploration | 3D printing rockets]] will remain the primary method if rocket production scales to hundreds per day, as it might become cheaper to use dedicated machines for such high volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. However, Relativity Space is considered the world expert in [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | 3D printing rocket hardware]], having applied it to areas previously dismissed, securing their position as a company regardless of market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. The company believes that their [[future_prospects_of_3d_printing_in_space_exploration | 3D printed rocket]] technology can significantly lower the cost of space access, potentially making it possible for more people to go to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

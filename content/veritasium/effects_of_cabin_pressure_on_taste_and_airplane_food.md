Many passengers find that food consumed on an airplane tastes different, often described as bland or mushy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. This altered perception is not entirely the fault of airline catering, but rather a consequence of the unique cabin environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## How Cabin Environment Affects Taste

The primary factors influencing taste perception in flight are:

*   **Dry Air** The air pumped into the aircraft cabin at cruising altitude is exceptionally dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. While the Sahara Desert has an average relative humidity of 25%, an airplane cabin can drop to as low as 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This extreme dryness can dehydrate the nasal passages, impairing one's sense of smell, which is crucial for taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Lower Cabin Pressure** The cabin pressure inside an airplane is significantly lower than at sea level. For example, at cruising altitude, the pressure can drop to around 77 kilopascals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This reduced pressure can diminish the intensity of taste sensations, particularly those of salt and sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

## The Umami Exception: Why Tomato Juice is Popular

Despite the general dulling of flavors, one taste profile, umami (savory), appears to be enhanced during flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This might explain a peculiar phenomenon: a German survey found that over a quarter of flyers order tomato juice on flights, with 23% of those never drinking it on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Some individuals even choose Bloody Marys as a dedicated "plane drink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

A 2015 study suggests that the loud cabin noise, a type of [[Sensory perceptions in soundproof environments | sensory perception]], might unintentionally stimulate the chorda tympani nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. This nerve carries taste information from the tongue to the brainstem and runs near the eardrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. This stimulation could create an "audio illusion" that boosts the perception of umami, the savory taste found in ingredients like MSG, soy sauce, and tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

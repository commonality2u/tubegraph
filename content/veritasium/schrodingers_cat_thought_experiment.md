The [[Schrodingers cat thought experiment | Schrödinger's Cat]] thought experiment was devised by Erwin Schrödinger as a critique of the prevailing interpretation of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]] at the time, particularly the concept of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function collapse]] upon measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Background: The Problem of Measurement

In classical mechanics, knowing a system's state (e.g., a particle's position and velocity) allows for precise future predictions using equations like Newton's second law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Similarly, in [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]], knowing a particle's quantum state (its [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]]) allows the Schrödinger equation to predict its future evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This evolution typically involves the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] spreading out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The fundamental problem arises because while the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] spreads out smoothly, actual measurements of a particle always find it at a single point in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The early founders of quantum theory prioritized the observed measurement as more "real" than the spreading [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Max Born proposed that the squared amplitude of the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] at any point in space represents the probability of finding the particle there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This "Born rule" introduced probability directly into the core understanding of reality, making the universe no longer entirely [[quantum_mechanics_and_deterministic_universe | deterministic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This probabilistic interpretation, despite making scientists like Einstein uncomfortable, became central to [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]] due to its predictive success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

The traditional understanding of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]], thus, involves two sets of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>:
1.  **Evolution**: When unobserved, the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] evolves according to the Schrödinger equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
2.  **Collapse**: When a measurement is made, the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] suddenly and irreversibly collapses to a single outcome, with the probability determined by the squared amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## The Experiment Setup

Schrödinger invented his famous thought experiment to highlight the absurdity of applying the concept of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function collapse]] to macroscopic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

The setup includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>:
*   A cat inside a sealed box.
*   A radioactive atom that may or may not decay.
*   A radiation detector linked to a mechanism that releases poisonous cyanide gas if the atom decays.
*   *(Note: Schrödinger helpfully added that the device "must be secured against direct interference by the cat".)* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The purpose of the experiment is to magnify the quantum state of the atom to a macroscopic, tangible object – the cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## The Paradox

The sequence of events is as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:
*   If the atom decays, the detector senses radiation, releases poison, and the cat dies.
*   If the atom does not decay, no poison is released, and the cat remains alive.

The state of the cat and the detector apparatus are directly tied to the state of the atom, meaning they are [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | entangled]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

According to standard [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]], prior to any measurement, the atom exists in a [[double_slit_experiment_and_its_implications | superposition]] of both decayed and not-decayed states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This [[double_slit_experiment_and_its_implications | superposition]] then becomes [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | entangled]] with the detector and subsequently the cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

The result is that the entire system inside the box, including the cat, is in a [[double_slit_experiment_and_its_implications | superposition]] of states: "atom not decayed, poison not released, cat alive" AND "atom decayed, poison released, cat dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Therefore, the cat is both alive and dead at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Only when an observer opens the box and makes a measurement does the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function collapse]], and the cat definitively becomes either dead or alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Schrödinger used this to show that the interpretation requiring [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function collapse]] seemed flawed when applied to macroscopic reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Components of Schrödinger's Cat

To find a "better way to think about Schrödinger's cat," one must examine its three essential components: superposition, entanglement, and measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Superposition
[[double_slit_experiment_and_its_implications | Superposition]] is the idea that quantum objects can exist in multiple states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This is indirectly observed in the [[thomas_youngs_double_slit_experiment | double-slit experiment]], where individual electrons fired through two slits create an interference pattern, forcing the conclusion that each electron somehow goes through both slits simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This phenomenon is easily understood if electrons are represented by [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | waves]] when unobserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Therefore, [[double_slit_experiment_and_its_implications | superposition]] is considered to be on solid ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Entanglement
[[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | Entanglement]] occurs when two or more particles become linked such that the quantum state of one instantaneously influences the others, regardless of distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. For example, if two electrons scatter off each other, their momenta become linked. Measuring the momentum of one immediately reveals the momentum of the other, due to conservation of momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Before measurement, each electron's momentum is in a [[double_slit_experiment_and_its_implications | superposition]], but measuring one instantaneously collapses the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This is because after interacting, the electrons are described by a single, shared [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Rigorously, there is only one [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] for the entire universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Measurement
The "measurement postulate" was added to [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]] to bridge the mathematical description of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave functions]] with observed reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. However, it seems odd to have one rule for how systems evolve when unobserved and a different rule for when they are observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Measurement, at its core, is just the interaction of one quantum system with another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## The Many-Worlds Interpretation

The [[manyworlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many-Worlds Interpretation]] (MWI), formulated by Hugh Everett, proposes a way to resolve the measurement problem by removing the need for [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function collapse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

In MWI, if we discard the rules associated with measurement, the Schrödinger's Cat experiment unfolds differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>:
1.  The radioactive atom's [[double_slit_experiment_and_its_implications | superposition]] of decayed and not-decayed states becomes [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | entangled]] with the detector and then the cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
2.  Since humans are also made of quantum-mechanical particles, when an observer opens the box, there is no "measurement" or [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function collapse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Instead, the observer simply becomes [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | entangled]] with the state of everything inside the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
3.  This means the observer sees the cat alive, and also sees the cat dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The solution to this apparent contradiction is that the "you" who saw the cat alive and the "you" who saw it dead inhabit separate, non-interacting worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Environmental Decoherence and Branching
The creation of these separate worlds is explained by **environmental decoherence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. When a quantum object in a [[double_slit_experiment_and_its_implications | superposition]] becomes [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | entangled]] with its environment (e.g., air molecules, photons), the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] of the universe branches, essentially splitting the universe into slightly different copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

A more detailed account of Schrödinger's Cat under MWI:
1.  The radioactive atom evolves into a [[double_slit_experiment_and_its_implications | superposition]] of decayed and not decayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
2.  The detector becomes [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | entangled]] with this [[double_slit_experiment_and_its_implications | superposition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
3.  The detector then interacts with its environment (air molecules, photons) which would be different depending on whether it detected radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
4.  Almost immediately, the detector becomes [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | entangled]] with the environment, causing decoherence and branching the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] into two distinct realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
5.  At this point, an observer (and the cat) is split into two identical copies, each [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | entangled]] with a different outcome of the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. One observer-copy is in a reality where the cat is alive, and the other is in a reality where the cat is dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
6.  When the box is opened, the observer simply "finds out" which state they are entangled with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The other outcome also happened, but to a version of the observer who is no longer identical or interacting with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### Implications of MWI

*   **Continuous Branching**: The branching of the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] is happening constantly and frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. For example, radioactive decays occur approximately 5,000 times per second in the human body, each causing a branching of the universe's [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Infinite Worlds**: While the exact number of branches (or "worlds") is unknown and depends on unresolved questions in [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum gravity]] and cosmology, it is an "enormous" number and potentially infinite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Natural Mathematics**: All these worlds are a natural part of the mathematics of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]]; MWI simply takes them seriously instead of invoking an ad-hoc [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function collapse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Deterministic Universe**: MWI implies that the universe is again [[quantum_mechanics_and_deterministic_universe | deterministic]], as every outcome happens 100% of the time, just in different branches. We only experience our tiny "sliver" of the multiverse, so it appears probabilistic to us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Not "Everything Happens"**: MWI does *not* mean literally everything that *could* possibly happen happens. The [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] still obeys the Schrödinger equation, which means certain events (like an electron turning into a proton, violating conservation laws) have zero probability and thus never happen in any branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Human Convenience**: The concept of "branches" or "worlds" is a convenient way for humans to describe the universe's evolving [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]], but it is not inherently built into the fundamental fabric of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Just as temperature and pressure are convenient descriptions for air molecules, branches are a convenient way to conceptualize the complex, single [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

In the MWI view, the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | wave function]] is the complete picture of reality, and our measurement is merely a small fraction of it that we become [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | entangled]] with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

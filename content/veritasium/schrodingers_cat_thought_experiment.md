The **Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment** was devised by Erwin Schrödinger to illustrate what he perceived as the absurdity and problems of the prevailing interpretation of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanics]] at the time, particularly the concept of wave function collapse upon measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a>.

## Background

In [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanics]], if the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum state]] of a particle (its [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]]) is known, the Schrödinger equation can be used to predict its future behavior, which usually involves spreading out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, unlike classical mechanics where a particle's position and velocity are directly observed, the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] itself is never directly observed. Instead, when a measurement is made, the particle is found at a single point in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This presents a challenge: how to reconcile the smoothly evolving, spread-out [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] with the point-like particle detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Max Born proposed an interpretation of the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]]: squaring its complex amplitude at any point in space gives the probability of finding the particle there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This "Born rule" introduced probability into the core picture of reality, making the universe no longer deterministic, which was unsettling to many scientists, including Einstein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

This led to the understanding that [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanics]] operates under two sets of rules:
1.  **Evolution:** When not observed, the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] evolves smoothly according to the Schrödinger equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
2.  **Collapse:** When a measurement is made, the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] suddenly and irreversibly "collapses" to a single outcome, with the probability determined by the squared amplitude of the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Schrödinger disliked this two-rule formulation, particularly the idea of collapse, leading him to invent the cat thought experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a>.

## The Experiment Setup

The experiment involves placing a cat in a sealed box with a radioactive atom, a radiation detector, and a vial of poisonous cyanide gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   If the radioactive atom decays, the detector senses the radiation, triggers the release of the poison, and the cat dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   If the atom does not decay, no poison is released, and the cat remains alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

The purpose of the experiment is to magnify the quantum state of the atom (decayed or not decayed) to a macroscopic and tangible level (dead or alive cat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## The Quantum Problem

According to the rules of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanics]], the radioactive atom does not simply exist in either a decayed or not-decayed state; it exists in a **superposition** of both states simultaneously, assuming no measurements have been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Because the state of the cat and detector are directly tied to the atom's state, they become **entangled** with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

Therefore, the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] of everything inside the box, including the cat, is in a superposition of two states:
1.  Atom has not decayed, poison not released, cat alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
2.  Atom has decayed, poison released, cat dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

This implies that the cat is both alive and dead at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Only when an observer opens the box and makes a measurement does the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] "collapse," and the cat becomes definitively either dead or alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Schrödinger's intention with this thought experiment was not to highlight the weirdness of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanics]], but to demonstrate that its formulation was, in his view, fundamentally wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

## Re-evaluating the Components

To find a "better way to think about Schrödinger's cat," one must examine the experiment's essential components: superposition, entanglement, and measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

### Superposition
While it seems counterintuitive that quantum objects can be in two different states simultaneously, this idea is indirectly supported by the [[double_slit_experiment | double slit experiment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. When individual electrons are fired through two slits, they produce an interference pattern, forcing the conclusion that a single electron somehow passes through both slits simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. This is easily understood with waves, which are spread out in space and can interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Since electrons are represented by [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave functions]] when not observed, superposition is considered to be on solid ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

### Entanglement
Entanglement occurs when interacting particles are no longer described by separate [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave functions]] but by a single, shared [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. For example, if two electrons scatter off each other, measuring the momentum of one instantaneously reveals the momentum of the other, even if they are light-years apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Before measurement, each electron's momentum was in a superposition of states; measuring one immediately "collapsed" the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Rigorously, there is only one [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]]—that of the entire universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Entanglement is a fundamental part of quantum theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

### Measurement
The measurement postulate was added as a second set of rules to bridge the mathematics of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanics]] with observable reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. However, it seems inconsistent to have one rule for how systems evolve when unobserved and a different rule for when they are observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. Fundamentally, a measurement is simply the interaction of one [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum system]] with another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

## The [[many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many Worlds Interpretation]]

The [[many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many Worlds Interpretation]] (MWI), formulated by Hugh Everett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>, proposes to throw out the measurement rules and the concept of wave function collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

In the MWI, when an observer opens the Schrödinger's cat box, there is no "measurement" or "wave function collapse." Instead, the observer (who is also made of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanical]] particles) simply becomes entangled with the state of everything inside the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. This means the observer sees both the cat alive and the cat dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

The resolution to this paradox is that the "you" who saw the cat alive and the "you" who saw it dead actually inhabit separate, complete realities that will never interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. These separate worlds arise from a process called **environmental decoherence**. If a quantum object in a superposition becomes entangled with its environment (e.g., air molecules, photons), its [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. This "branches the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] of the universe," splitting it into two slightly different copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.

In the context of Schrödinger's cat:
1.  The radioactive atom is in a superposition of decayed and not decayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.
2.  The detector becomes entangled with this superposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.
3.  The detector then interacts with and entangles with its environment (air molecules, photons), leading to decoherence and branching the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] into two distinct realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.
4.  At that moment, the observer is also split into two identical copies, each entangled with one outcome of the experiment (one seeing an alive cat, the other a dead cat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. When the observer opens the box, the cat already is either alive or dead within that specific branch; the observer is simply finding out which outcome happened in *their* reality, unaware that the other outcome also happened in a different reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.

The branching of the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] is believed to happen constantly, possibly infinitely often, creating infinite subtly different worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. While this may sound implausible, these worlds are a natural part of the mathematics of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanics]]; rejecting them requires an added concept like wave function collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

## Implications of Many Worlds

*   **Deterministic Universe:** The universe becomes deterministic again, as every possible outcome predicted by the Schrödinger equation actually happens in some branch of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. It only appears non-deterministic to us because we experience only our tiny sliver of the multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.
*   **Energy Conservation:** The energy of the entire [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] is conserved. The branching is seen as subdividing the universe into pieces, where inhabitants of each branch perceive a specific energy related to their branch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.
*   **Frequency of Branching:** Branching happens whenever a [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum system]] in superposition becomes entangled with its environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. For example, radioactive decays within the human body occur thousands of times per second, leading to frequent branching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. The exact number of worlds or the frequency of branching is unknown, possibly infinite, but certainly "jumbo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.
*   **Not "Everything Happens":** MWI does not mean "everything that could possibly happen happens." It means the [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]] obeys the Schrödinger equation, which predicts many potential outcomes but not all. For instance, an electron will not convert into a proton as this violates conservation laws given zero probability by the Schrödinger equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>. However, a "very low amplitude world" where a specific person becomes president is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.
*   **Branching Speed:** Whether branching happens instantly across all space or spreads out at the speed of light is a matter of description. Both descriptions lead to the same predictions. The concept of "branches" is a human convenience for understanding the universe's [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave function]], not an inherent part of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>.

In summary, the [[many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many Worlds Interpretation]] simplifies the formalism of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanics]] by asserting that only [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | wave functions]] evolving under the Schrödinger equation exist, and our observation is merely becoming entangled with a fraction of that reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.

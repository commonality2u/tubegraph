The study and photography of snowflakes have a rich history, with pioneers like Wilson A. Bentley and Ukichiro Nakaya laying the groundwork for modern understanding. Today, researchers like Dr. [[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]] continue to push the boundaries of snowflake science, even [[creating_snowflakes_in_the_lab | designing them in a laboratory setting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Pioneers in Snowflake Photography

### Wilson A. Bentley: "The Snowflake Man"
The first close-up photograph of a snowflake in the wild was captured in 1885 by American meteorologist Wilson A. Bentley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Bentley is credited with originating the enduring idea that no two snowflakes are alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Throughout his lifetime, he meticulously documented snowflakes, taking over 5,000 photographs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. A selection of his iconic images was published in his book, "Snow Crystals," which remains in print today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Bentley's photographic collection prominently features snowflakes of exceptional beauty and symmetry, as he specifically selected those in pristine condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Finding such perfect specimens is a rare feat, often described as "one in a million" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Ukichiro Nakaya: Systematic Study
In the 1930s, Ukichiro Nakaya systematically studied snowflakes at the University of Hokkaido in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. His research revealed that different [[types_and_structures_of_snowflakes | types of snowflakes]] do not form under random conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Instead, the specific form of a snowflake is determined by two key factors: temperature and the level of super saturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. His findings were summarized in the Nakaya Diagram, which illustrates the relationship between these environmental conditions and the resulting snowflake types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. For example:
*   Around -2 Celsius: Plates form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   At -5 Celsius: Columns and needles form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   At -15 Celsius: Plates form again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   Below -20 Celsius: Columns and plates form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

The Nakaya Diagram allows for a rough understanding of a snowflake's history by examining its shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The intricate nature of snowflakes arises because the temperature and humidity at each moment of growth determine the structures formed in that specific moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Modern Snowflake Research

Dr. [[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]], often called "the snowflake guy," is a leading expert in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. His work includes consulting for media like the movie "Frozen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> and having his snowflake photographs featured on US Post Office stamps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. He has also authored several books on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Designing Snowflakes in the Lab
[[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]] possesses the ability to design and construct snowflakes in a laboratory to his own specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This process involves precise control of temperature and humidity (super saturation) to influence growth patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For example, lowering the temperature and increasing humidity can cause branches to emerge from a snowflake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He describes these as "designer snowflakes," hand-crafted and unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Lab-grown snowflakes tend to have sharper and crisper facets and edges compared to natural ones, which can experience some evaporation during their fall and collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### The "No Two Snowflakes Are Alike" Principle
While Wilson A. Bentley popularized the idea that no two snowflakes are alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, this concept applies to any complex natural object, similar to how no two trees or grains of sand are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Once complexity is introduced, there is an uncountable number of ways for structures to form, leading to infinite variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

The symmetrical growth observed in snowflakes is not due to one side "knowing" what the other is doing, but rather because all sides of a single snowflake experience the exact same environmental conditions during growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Different snowflakes, however, each follow a unique path through the atmosphere, encountering a distinct set of conditions, which is why they are unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

In the lab, with carefully controlled conditions, it is possible to create nearly identical snowflakes, which [[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]] has achieved, calling them "identical twin snowflakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

### Understanding Snowflake Growth
One of the core mysteries of snowflakes, especially since Nakaya's diagram, has been why ice crystals form specific [[types_and_structures_of_snowflakes | shapes]] (plates, columns, etc.) at particular temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. [[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]] has developed a hypothesis to explain this phenomenon, building upon the concept of nucleation barriers.

When water vapor molecules hit a smooth, flat surface of an ice crystal (facet surface), they tend to bounce off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Conversely, on rough areas with dangling molecular bonds, molecules are more likely to stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This causes rough areas to fill in faster, leading to a faceted shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. A snowflake begins as a hexagonal prism with two basal facets and six prism facets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

*   If basal facets grow faster, a column forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   If prism facets grow faster, a flat snowflake forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Growth is influenced by the nucleation barrier, which is the critical density of additional molecules needed to form a stable island for a new layer on the crystal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The nucleation barriers for basal and prism facets differ and vary with temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This explains why plates form around -2 Celsius (lower barrier for prism facets) and columns below -20 Celsius (lower barrier for basal facets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

The puzzle of why columns appear around -5 Celsius and plates again at -15 Celsius is addressed by Ken's hypothesis: these nucleation barriers apply to large flat facets, but are different for *narrow* facets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. He proposes that narrow basal facets have a dip in their nucleation barrier around -4 Celsius, and narrow prism facets have a dip at -15 Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. This theory aligns with all observed snowflake forms at various temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This occurs because water molecules diffusing along the surface of narrow edges can exceed the critical density to overcome the nucleation barrier, effectively lowering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Experiments conducted by [[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]] support this hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

After 85 years since Nakaya's diagram, modern understanding of the molecular physics of ice now provides comprehensive explanations for the diverse columnar and plate-like forms of snowflakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. This persistent pursuit of understanding the fundamental "how it works" drives scientific discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

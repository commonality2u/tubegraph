[[history_of_dark_matter_hypothesis|Dark matter]] is hypothesized to constitute 85% of all matter in existence, potentially forming a "shadow universe" five times more massive than everything visible to us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Decades of experiments have sought its direct detection.

## The DAMA/LIBRA Experiment

Located under a mountain in the Italian Alps, the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter detector has been collecting data for approximately 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It consistently reports peculiar results: the rate of detections peaks in June and reaches a minimum in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### The Annual Signal Hypothesis

One theory suggests this periodic annual signal is the first direct evidence of [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Our galaxy is believed to be surrounded and permeated by a vast sphere of [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] particles moving randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Our solar system travels through the galaxy at 220 kilometers per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, moving through the [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] halo at this rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The Earth's orbit around the sun at 30 kilometers per second means that for half the year, we move faster through [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] (peaking in June), and for the other half, we move slower (minimum in November) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. This variable speed could lead to encountering more [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] when moving fastest and less when moving slowest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

### Alternative Explanations for DAMA/LIBRA's Signal

The DAMA/LIBRA signal might not be due to [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. Many mundane factors fluctuate annually, such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, snow on the mountain, or even tourist numbers in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Another issue is that other similar experiments have not detected anything, leading to uncertainty about the DAMA/LIBRA signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

## Next-Generation Detection: The Southern Hemisphere Experiment

To resolve the DAMA/LIBRA controversy, an almost identical experiment is being built in a gold mine outside Melbourne, Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. In the Southern Hemisphere, seasons are reversed, but motion through [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. If this new detector observes the same signal, it would provide strong evidence for the existence of [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Detector Design and Challenges

These experiments are designed to look for WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), which are theorized to weigh about as much as a proton but interact very weakly with ordinary matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

### Core Components

At the heart of the detector are seven-kilogram crystals of pure sodium iodide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. The principle is that a rare [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] particle might strike a nucleus in the crystal, transferring energy and creating a flash of light (scintillation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. These scintillations are detected by sensitive photomultiplier tubes positioned around each crystal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

### Mitigating Background Noise

Several measures are taken to eliminate background noise that could mimic a [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] event:

*   **Radioactive Decay (Potassium-40):** Even pure sodium iodide contains radioactive potassium. To filter out scintillations caused by potassium decay (which emits an electron and a gamma ray), the crystals are submerged in 12 tons of liquid scintillator (linear alkylbenzene) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. If a flash is detected simultaneously in the crystal and the surrounding liquid (due to the gamma ray), it's identified as a potassium decay, not a [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.
*   **Cosmic Rays:** Energetic [[historical_discoveries_about_cosmic_rays|cosmic rays]] from the sun and other galaxies produce muons when they hit Earth's atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. Muons can also cause scintillations in the crystal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. To counter this, sensitive particle detectors are located deep underground, where muon counts are reduced by a factor of a million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. Additional muon detectors placed directly above the tank allow any crystal flashes coinciding with a muon detection to be ruled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.
*   **Mine Radioactivity:** Underground environments present their own challenges. Mine walls contain trace radioactive elements like uranium and thorium, which decay into radon gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. To combat this, cavern walls are coated with special paint, crystals are bathed in a continuous stream of pure nitrogen gas, and the entire detector is shielded by 120 tons of steel and plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.

## Evidence for Dark Matter (Beyond Direct Detection)

### Astronomical Observations

The belief in [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] stems from several astronomical observations:

*   **Galaxy Cluster Speeds:** In 1933, Fritz Zwicky observed galaxies in the Coma Cluster moving faster than expected, suggesting unseen matter was pulling them inwards. He coined the term "dunkle materie" (dark matter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Galaxy Rotation Curves:** Forty years later, Vera Rubin and Kent Ford studied stars in the Andromeda Galaxy, expecting outer stars to orbit slower. Instead, rotational velocity remained constant with increasing distance from the center, implying additional mass was needed to prevent stars from being flung into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Albert Bosma's radio telescope measurements of hydrogen gas further out in galaxies confirmed this constant velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
*   **The Bullet Cluster:** This collision of two galaxy clusters shows a separation between ordinary matter (interstellar gas, which slowed down) and the inferred mass distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. Gravitational lensing reveals that most of the mass is on either side of the collision, where the [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] passed through, while the gas got stuck in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

### [[alternative_theories_to_dark_matter|Alternative Theories]]: Modified Gravity

An [[alternative_theories_to_dark_matter|alternative theory]] to [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] is to modify the theory of gravity itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) suggests a limit to how low acceleration can go, rather than an additional force from unseen matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. However, the scientific consensus largely favors [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] as a physical substance, implying the existence of unseen particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

### [[Cosmic background radiation and dark matter|Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)]]

Further evidence for [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] comes from the [[Cosmic background radiation and dark matter|Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB), the oldest light in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. This light, released 380,000 years after the Big Bang, shows tiny temperature differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. The pattern of these temperature variations, represented as peaks on a graph, depends on the amount of [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. To match CMB measurements, approximately five times as much [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] as ordinary matter is required, a figure consistent with observations from galaxy and cluster dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

## The Nature of Dark Matter

The [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] hypothesis provides a simple theoretical framework that explains diverse observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. While the specific particle type is unknown, leading to many proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, it's possible that [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|dark matter]] comprises more than one particle, potentially forming an entire "dark standard model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. Scientists hope there is some level of [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter|interaction with ordinary matter]] to allow for its detection through experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.

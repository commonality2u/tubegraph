The speed of light in a vacuum is precisely defined as 299,792,458 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Since 1983, this value has been used to define the meter itself, meaning a meter is the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458ths of a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This definition makes the speed of light an exact number without decimals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. However, despite this precise definition, no one has ever truly measured the one-way speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Challenges in Measuring Light's Speed

Measuring the speed of light differs fundamentally from measuring the speed of ordinary objects, like a baseball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For a baseball, speed is determined by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken between two points, typically with a single, internal clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

To measure the one-way speed of light, one might imagine a laser beam traveling one kilometer from a start point (A) to an end point (B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Several issues arise:
*   **Single Clock Problem**: If the clock is at the start point, how do you know the exact instant light reaches the end point? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>
*   **Two Clocks & Synchronization**: Using two clocks (one at A, one at B) that stop automatically upon light detection requires them to be perfectly synchronized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   **Synchronization by Pulse**: Connecting clocks with a wire and sending a pulse also fails, as that pulse travels at the speed of light, introducing a time delay equal to the very thing you're trying to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
    *   **Synchronization by Movement**: Synchronizing clocks together then moving one to the end point also fails. [[einsteins_equivalence_principle_and_its_implications | Special relativity]] dictates that moving clocks tick slower relative to stationary observers, causing them to fall out of sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## The Two-Way Measurement

The only practical solution to these measurement challenges is to use a single clock and measure the time it takes for light to make a round trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This involves placing a mirror at the end point to reflect the light back to the starting clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

This method was first used by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1849 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. He shone a light beam through a rapidly spinning gear's teeth to a mirror 8 kilometers away. By increasing the gear's speed, he found a point where the reflected light passed through the *next* gap, allowing him to calculate the speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Fizeau measured the speed of light to be 313,000 kilometers per second, within 5% of the currently accepted value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

However, Fizeau, and all subsequent experiments, have only measured the **round trip** or **two-way speed of light**, not the **one-way speed of light** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### The Unknowable One-Way Speed

It is theoretically possible that the speed of light is different in different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. For example, light could travel at half of 'c' (c/2) in one direction and be instantaneous on the return journey, yet the observed round-trip speed would still be 'c' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Consider communicating with an astronaut on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If a signal takes 20 minutes for a round trip (10 minutes there, 10 minutes back by convention), there's no experimental way to disprove that the outbound message took all 20 minutes and the reply came back instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Both scenarios yield the same observed 20-minute round trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

While our universe exhibits many symmetries, some asymmetries exist (e.g., matter-antimatter imbalance), so a preferred direction in spacetime is not impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Physicists have developed internally consistent theories where the speed of light differs forwards and backwards, ranging from a few percent variation to extreme cases like c/2 one way and instantaneous the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Einstein's Synchronization Convention

The idea that light travels at the same speed in all directions is a **convention**, not an experimentally verified fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Albert Einstein himself highlighted this in his 1905 paper, "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

To synchronize clocks at different locations (A and B), Einstein states that "there is no way that we can meaningfully compare the times they measure unless we established *by definition* that the time required by light to travel from A to B equals the time it requires to travel from B to A" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:07:06]</a>. This is known as the [[einsteins_equivalence_principle_and_its_implications | Einstein synchronization convention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. He emphasized that this is a "stipulation" made "of my own free will to arrive at a definition of simultaneity," not a physical hypothesis about light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

This means that while the two-way speed of light is constant for all inertial observers, the one-way speed of light cannot be uniquely defined or measured independently of this convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Unsuccessful Attempts to Measure One-Way Speed

Over a century of scientific effort has been unable to measure the one-way speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Common proposed methods consistently fail:

*   **High-Speed Cameras**: Even cameras shooting at a trillion frames per second only capture light's journey as it bounces *back* to the camera, still measuring the two-way speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Long Fiber Optic Cables**: Shining light through a vast spool of fiber optic cable, even one 186,000 miles long, still involves countless internal reflections and round trips within the fiber, effectively measuring an averaged two-way speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Central Synchronizing Device**: Placing a device midway between two clocks to send simultaneous pulses would only perfectly synchronize the clocks if the one-way speed of light were already the same in both directions. If the speed were different, the clocks would be out of sync by precisely the amount that would make any subsequent measurement of the one-way speed appear to be 'c' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **GPS Synchronization**: The entire GPS system relies on the assumption that the speed of light is the same in all directions. If it weren't, the light pulses from satellites would travel at different speeds, leading to incorrectly synchronized clocks that would *always* measure the one-way speed as 'c' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Moving Clocks Apart**: Starting with synchronized clocks and moving them apart at equal and opposite speeds theoretically maintains synchronization due to symmetrical time dilation. However, this only works if the one-way speed of light (and thus time dilation) is uniform in all directions. If the speed varies by direction, so too would time dilation, making this method unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

The fundamental dilemma remains: we need synchronized clocks to measure the one-way speed of light, but we need to know the one-way speed of light to synchronize our clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

## Implications of an Undefined One-Way Speed

The choice of the [[einsteins_equivalence_principle_and_its_implications | Einstein synchronization convention]] has profound implications for how we perceive simultaneity across distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

### The Mars Communication Example
Consider a scenario where Earth (mission control) and Mars (astronaut Mark) try to synchronize clocks:
1.  **Earth's Message**: At noon Earth time, a message is sent to Mars: "This signal was sent at exactly 12 o'clock." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>
2.  **Mark's Convention**: Knowing the roundtrip delay is 20 minutes, Mark assumes the signal took 10 minutes to reach him. He sets his clock to 12:10 PM upon receipt and sends a reply: "This reply sent at 12:10." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>
3.  **Earth's Confirmation**: Earth receives the reply at 12:20 PM, confirming successful synchronization based on the convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

Now, imagine the *actual* one-way speed of light from Earth to Mars is c/2 (taking 20 minutes) and instantaneous from Mars to Earth, though no one is aware of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>:
1.  **Earth's Message**: Sent at 12:00 PM Earth time.
2.  **Mark's Receipt**: It actually takes 20 minutes to reach Mars, so Mark receives it at 12:20 PM Earth time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
3.  **Mark Sets Clock**: Still assuming the 10-minute conventional delay, Mark sets his clock to 12:10 PM *even though it's 12:20 PM on Earth* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
4.  **Mark's Reply**: Mark sends his reply at his 12:10 PM.
5.  **Earth's Receipt**: Due to instantaneous return travel, the reply is received on Earth at 12:20 PM Earth time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

From the communicators' perspective, the experience is identical: same messages, same local delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. However, their clocks are actually out of sync by 10 minutes, with Mark's clock being 10 minutes "behind" Earth's true time. This error is undetectable and uncorrectable through any communication method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

### Perceptual Differences
If the one-way speed of light varied in this extreme way:
*   Mark would see Earth as it was 20 minutes ago (due to the slow inbound light) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   Earth would see Mars in real-time (due to instantaneous inbound light) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   Extending this, looking out from Earth, one could see stars hundreds of light-years away not as they looked centuries ago, but *exactly as they are right now* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

This highlights the flexibility in defining simultaneity at different locations and the one-way speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

## Ongoing Debate and Future Implications

The debate over the one-way speed of light has continued since 1905 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Some physicists advocate for simplicity, appealing to Occam's razor: it's simpler to assume light travels at the same speed in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Most working physicists simply accept this as a convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

However, it remains a convention, not an empirically proven fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This "hidden" aspect of the universe, where the one-way speed of light might not even have a well-defined value, raises fundamental questions about the concept of simultaneity across distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. It could be a simple quirk of the universe, or it might be a crucial clue for the next [[einsteins_equivalence_principle_and_its_implications | paradigmatic leap]] in physics, connecting General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, space, and time in ways we don't yet understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

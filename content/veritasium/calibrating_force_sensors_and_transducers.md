Force sensors, also known as Force Transducers, are critical devices used to measure large forces, such as the thrust of jet engines and rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For context, an apple weighs about 1 newton, while the world record for jet engine thrust is 570,000 newtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, and the Saturn V rocket had a thrust of 33,360,000 newtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The accurate [[measurement_of_large_forces | measurement of large forces]] is essential, especially in applications like aerospace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## The Dead Weight Machine

Accurate calibration of force transducers is performed using a specialized dead weight machine managed by the [[mass_and_force_calibration_methods | Mass and Force Group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This particular machine is designed to apply up to 4,448,222 newtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, which is precisely equal to 1,000,000 pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It is considered one of the largest, if not *the* largest, machine of its type in the world for calibrating such large mass objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Another machine mentioned has a capacity of 13.3 meganewtons (three million pounds force) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### How it Works

The dead weight machine operates with 20 carefully calibrated masses, each weighing approximately 50,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. These masses are stored below ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

1.  A force transducer is placed on a compression head in the lab upstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  A hydraulic ram in the attic begins to raise a green lifting frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
3.  Once the force transducer contacts a red loading frame, it starts to lift the weights located downstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
4.  As the lifting frame continues to rise, more of the 50,000-pound weights become suspended by the force sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
5.  Since the exact weight of these masses is known, the readouts from the force transducer can be precisely calibrated against an accurately-known force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
6.  Calibrated devices are then used in the field, for instance, embedded in test stands to monitor rocket thrust during firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This ensures accuracy when determining power levels, such as "104% of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Achieving Extreme Precision

Minimizing uncertainty is paramount in force calibration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Each 50,000-pound mass has an astonishingly precise known value of approximately 50,036.27 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. To put this into perspective, each mass is equivalent to about ten minivans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, and its exact value is known to within the weight of several American nickels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

This tiny uncertainty is achieved by referencing the very [[issues_with_the_stability_of_physical_mass_standards | definition of the kilogram]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, using K20, which is the United States [[alternate_approaches_to_defining_the_kilogram | fundamental mass standard]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

The calibration process for the 50,000-pound masses involves a step-up method:
1.  Starting with K20, combinations of known weights are compared to larger unknown weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
2.  For example, a single 5-kilogram mass is compared to combinations of 2-kilogram and 1-kilogram masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
3.  The process then converts to pounds, moving from 50-pound masses to 500 pounds, then 2500 pounds, and using a floor scale to reach 10,000 pounds, 20,000 pounds, and finally 30,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
4.  These large calibrated weights are then used to calibrate the 50,000-pound masses that form the dead weight stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Accounting for Environmental Factors

The vertical force vector generated by these weights hanging in a [[gravity_and_buoyancy_effects_on_largescale_mass_measurements | gravitational field]] is guaranteed with an uncertainty of 0.0005%, or five parts per million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This means that at a full one million pounds of applied force, the accuracy is guaranteed to within five pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

To achieve this level of precision, two critical environmental factors are accounted for:
*   **Gravitational Acceleration:** The local [[gravity_and_buoyancy_effects_on_largescale_mass_measurements | gravitational acceleration]] is slightly less than Earth's standard gravity at the calibration facility, requiring an additional 600 pounds to be added to the applied force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Buoyant Force:** The masses displace 125 pounds of air, creating a [[gravity_and_buoyancy_effects_on_largescale_mass_measurements | buoyant force]] that must be counteracted. An additional 125 pounds must be added to reach a million pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Necessity of Physical Testing

The existence of such a precise and large-scale calibration machine underscores the principle that "one physical test is worth a thousand expert opinions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This axiom is particularly true in physical testing, where ensuring extreme accuracy in measurements is vital. For industries like aerospace, minimizing uncertainty in force measurements is not just preferred but essential for safety and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

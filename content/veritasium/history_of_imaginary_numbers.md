Mathematics initially served practical purposes, such as quantifying the world, measuring land, predicting planetary motions, and tracking commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, the pursuit of a solution to the cubic equation eventually led to a problem considered impossible within the confines of traditional mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The secret to solving it involved separating math from the real world, splitting algebra from geometry, and inventing new numbers, eventually called "imaginary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Ironically, centuries later, these same numbers became fundamental to our best physical theories of the universe, suggesting that abandoning math's connection to reality was necessary to discover reality's true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Challenge of the Cubic Equation

In 1494, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci's math teacher, published "Summa de Arithmetica," a comprehensive summary of all known mathematics in Renaissance Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This work included a section on the cubic equation (ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For at least 4,000 years, civilizations including the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, and Persians had attempted to find a general solution to the cubic, but all came up empty-handed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Pacioli concluded that a solution to the cubic equation was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

This conclusion was surprising, given that quadratic equations (without the x³ term) had been solved by many ancient civilizations thousands of years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The general solution for quadratics ((-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a) is now widely known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Geometric Origins and Limitations

Ancient mathematicians derived solutions to equations like quadratics using geometry, not modern algebraic notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. For example, x² + 26x = 27 would be visualized as a square of side 'x' and a rectangle of sides '26' and 'x', with their combined area totaling 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The process of "completing the square" involved manipulating these areas to form a larger square, allowing for the solution of 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

This geometric approach, while intuitive, was incomplete. It could not account for negative solutions (e.g., -27 for x² + 26x = 27), as concepts like "a square with sides of length negative 27" made no sense in the real world of lengths, areas, and volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. As a result, negative numbers were largely disregarded by these mathematicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This aversion led to multiple versions of quadratic equations (six different types) and cubic equations (19 types identified by Omar Khayyam in the 11th century) to ensure all coefficients remained positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Khayyam found numerical solutions to some cubics by considering intersections of shapes, but he did not achieve a general solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## The Race to Solve the Cubic

### Scipione del Ferro's Secret
Around 1510, Scipione del Ferro, a mathematics professor at the University of Bologna, discovered a method to solve "depressed cubics" (cubic equations with no x² term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. To protect his job in a competitive environment where mathematicians challenged each other in public "math duels," del Ferro kept his solution a secret for nearly two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. He only revealed it to his student, Antonio Fior, on his deathbed in 1526 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### The Duel: Fior vs. Tartaglia
Fior, lacking his mentor's talent, boasted about his ability to solve depressed cubics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This led to a challenge on February 12, 1535, against Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia, a self-taught mathematician known for his stutter ("Tartaglia" means stutterer in Italian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Each presented 30 problems to the other, with Fior's problems all being depressed cubics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Tartaglia, skeptical of Fior's claims but aware that a solution might exist, worked to solve the depressed cubic himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. He extended the concept of "completing the square" into three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. For an equation like x³ + 9x = 26, he visualized x³ as a cube's volume and added volumes in a specific way to form a larger cube, which could be related back to a quadratic equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This method allowed him to find the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

In the duel, Fior failed to solve a single problem, while Tartaglia solved all 30 of Fior's depressed cubics in just two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Tartaglia later summarized his method not as equations, but as a poem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### Gerolamo Cardano and "Ars Magna"
Tartaglia's victory made him a celebrity, and Gerolamo Cardano, a polymath from Milan, was eager to learn his secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. After much persistence and a solemn oath from Cardano not to publish the method, Tartaglia revealed it in March 1539 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Cardano immediately began experimenting with the algorithm and made a crucial discovery: he found a substitution (x - b/3a) that could transform *any* general cubic equation into a depressed cubic, which could then be solved by Tartaglia's formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This was the general solution to the cubic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

Wanting to publish his discovery, Cardano sought a way around his oath. In 1542, during a visit to Bologna, he saw del Ferro's old notebook, which contained the solution to the depressed cubic, predating Tartaglia's discovery by decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Feeling released from his oath, Cardano published "Ars Magna" (The Great Art) in 1545, an updated compendium of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. He provided a geometric proof for each of the 13 arrangements of the cubic equation and acknowledged the contributions of Tartaglia, del Ferro, and Fior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Despite the acknowledgment, Tartaglia was greatly displeased, as the general solution to the cubic is often still called Cardano's method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## The Birth of Imaginary Numbers

While writing "Ars Magna," Cardano encountered cubic equations, such as x³ = 15x + 4, whose solutions, when plugged into the algorithm, contained the square roots of negative numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. He questioned Tartaglia about this, but Tartaglia had no answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Cardano's geometric derivation revealed a "geometric paradox": a part of a square that needed to have an area of 30 but sides of length 5, implying the need to add "negative area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

Previously, square roots of negatives (e.g., from finding two numbers that add to 10 and multiply to 40) were understood as indicators that no real solution existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. However, the cubic x³ = 15x + 4 *did* have a perfectly reasonable real solution (x=4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Unable to reconcile this, Cardano avoided this case in "Ars Magna," deeming the idea of square roots of negatives "as subtle as it is useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Rafael Bombelli's Breakthrough
Around 10 years later, the Italian engineer Rafael Bombelli took up the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Undeterred by the impossible geometry, he chose to treat the square root of a negative as its own new type of number, observing it "cannot be called either positive or negative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Bombelli hypothesized that the terms in Cardano's solution could be combinations of ordinary numbers and this new type of number, specifically involving the square root of negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Through this, he found that the two cube roots in Cardano's equation were equivalent to (2 + √-1) and (2 - √-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. When added together, the square roots canceled out, yielding the correct real answer, four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This was a "miraculous" discovery: Cardano's method worked, but only by temporarily abandoning the geometric proof and allowing "negative areas" as an intermediate step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

## Formalization and Modern Algebra
Over the next century, [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics_discoveries | modern mathematics]] began to take shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   In the 1600s, Francois Viete introduced modern symbolic notation for algebra, ending the ancient tradition of math problems as drawings and wordy descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Geometry was no longer the sole source of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.
*   Rene Descartes extensively used the square roots of negatives, popularizing them, but he called them "imaginary numbers"—a name that endured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   Later, Euler introduced the letter 'i' to represent the square root of negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   When combined with regular numbers, these formed [[development_of_complex_numbers | complex numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

The cubic equation directly led to the invention of these new numbers, liberating algebra from the constraints of geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. By accepting concepts that seemed to defy physical reality, mathematics became more powerful and capable of solving complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

## [[Application of imaginary numbers in physics | Application of Imaginary Numbers in Physics]]

The impact of imaginary numbers extended far beyond algebra. In 1925, Erwin Schrödinger, building on de Broglie's insight that matter consists of waves, sought a wave equation governing quantum particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. He developed the [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | Schrödinger equation]], one of the most fundamental equations in physics, which prominently features 'i', the square root of negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

Physicists, unlike mathematicians, were uncomfortable with 'i' appearing in a fundamental theory, with Schrödinger himself expressing objection to the use of [[development_of_complex_numbers | complex numbers]] in the wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

The reason for 'i's presence lies in the unique properties of [[application_of_imaginary_numbers_in_physics | imaginary numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. Imaginary numbers exist on a dimension perpendicular to the real number line, forming the [[development_of_complex_numbers | complex plane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. Repeated multiplication by 'i' results in rotations by 90 degrees in the complex plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. The function e^(ix) creates a spiral in this plane, whose real part is a cosine wave and whose imaginary part is a sine wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. As sine and cosine are quintessential wave functions, it was natural for Schrödinger to use a formulation like e^(ikx - ωt) as a solution for his wave equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. The exponential form also offered convenient properties for derivatives and the ability to linearly combine solutions to create any wave shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

Physicist Freeman Dyson noted that "Schrödinger put the square root of minus one into the equation, and suddenly it made sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. The equation accurately describes atomic behavior, forming the basis of chemistry and most of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. This unexpected reliance on [[development_of_complex_numbers | complex numbers]] in nature surprised everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

Thus, imaginary numbers, initially discovered as a quirky intermediate step in solving the cubic, proved to be fundamental to our description of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. By abandoning a strict connection to observable reality in mathematics, a deeper truth about the universe's workings was revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.

## Overview
"Rods from God" is the colloquial name for a proposed space-based weapon concept, also known as Project Thor, Brilliant Pebbles, or hypervelocity rod bundles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15">[03:15]</a>. This weapon involves dropping telephone pole-sized pieces of tungsten from orbit to strike targets on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37">[01:37]</a>. The weapon is designed to cause damage through kinetic energy rather than explosives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56">[02:56]</a>.

## Origin and Concept
The idea for this space weapon originated in the late 1950s by Boeing researcher Jerry Pournelle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13">[01:13]</a>. This concept arose in response to the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik in 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45">[00:45]</a> and the successful test of their first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57">[00:57]</a>. Pournelle's weapon, which he called Project Thor, aimed to hit any location on Earth within 15 minutes, destroy targets buried 30 meters underground, and theoretically intercept ICBMs mid-flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19">[01:19]</a>.

The concept involved placing telephone pole-sized pieces of tungsten in orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37">[01:37]</a>. These rods could be released to re-enter the atmosphere and strike a target in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56">[01:56]</a>. While in orbit, objects travel at about eight kilometers per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06">[02:06]</a>. Although atmospheric drag would slow them down upon re-entry, they would still impact at approximately Mach 10, or three kilometers per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10">[02:10]</a>.

## Kinetic Energy and Impact
The destructive power of Rods from God comes from their kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is directly proportional to an object's mass and the square of its velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48">[03:48]</a>. This means increasing velocity by a factor of 10 increases kinetic energy by a factor of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59">[03:59]</a>.

A single tungsten rod impacting at Mach 10 would release energy equivalent to the largest conventional explosive ever detonated, such as the MOAB (Massive Ordinance Air Blast), which released the equivalent of 11 tons of TNT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46">[02:46]</a>. Despite containing no explosives, the sheer kinetic energy makes them as powerful as conventional bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56">[02:56]</a>.

Kinetic impacts are explosive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58">[09:58]</a>. Similar to asteroid impacts on the moon that create circular craters, the extreme speed causes the impact to heat up the ground, turning it into liquid and gas, which then sprays outwards in a symmetric explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24">[10:24]</a>. This explosive kinetic energy allows the rods to penetrate approximately 30 meters of soil, sufficient for destroying bunkers or silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15">[11:15]</a>. The localized nature of the explosion means it could be used for precise "surgical strikes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22">[11:22]</a>. Additionally, unlike nuclear weapons, there would be no radioactive fallout, and their deployment does not contravene international agreements regarding nuclear weapons in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30">[11:30]</a>.

## Historical Consideration and Naming
Project Thor was seriously considered by the Reagan administration in the 1980s under the codename "Brilliant Pebbles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21">[03:21]</a>. The project was eventually abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31">[03:31]</a>. It was resurrected in 2003 by the Air Force Transformation Plan, where it was referred to as "hypervelocity rod bundles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33">[03:33]</a>. Colloquially, the weapon became known as "Rods from God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42">[03:42]</a>.

## Feasibility Challenges: Experimental Drop
An experimental drop was conducted using a helicopter to release heavy metal weights onto a sandcastle city and a swimming pool to simulate the impact of Rods from God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01">[05:01]</a>.

### Aiming Difficulties
Initial attempts to hit a swimming pool from 500 meters (1500 feet) using GPS targeting failed significantly due to factors like wind and the swinging motion of the attached weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11">[06:11]</a>. Even from a lower altitude of 100 meters (300 feet), attempts to hit the pool resulted in misses of around 60 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13">[13:13]</a>. A successful hit on the edge of the pool only occurred from a very low altitude of 50 meters (150 feet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55">[13:55]</a>.

### Impact Observations
When a 200-kilogram (440-pound) weight was dropped from 100 meters, it missed the sandcastle city's main structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45">[16:45]</a>. A subsequent direct hit on a sandcastle building at a lower altitude only caused partial damage and cracks, not complete destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23">[18:23]</a>. This suggested that while precise, it might not cause widespread devastation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37">[18:37]</a>.

## Feasibility Challenges: Theoretical and Practical
The experimental difficulties highlighted broader challenges in the practical implementation of Rods from God:

*   **Aiming**: Steering a Rod from God is theoretically possible using thrusters, adjustable fins, or by changing the rod's center of mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52">[19:52]</a>. However, aiming an object traveling at hypersonic speeds is incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00">[20:00]</a>. Communication with the rod from ground or space would also be nearly impossible due to the superheated plasma surrounding it during re-entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06">[20:06]</a>.
*   **Orbital Mechanics and Coverage**:
    *   **Geostationary Orbit**: Placing a rod in geostationary orbit (over 35,000 kilometers away) would mean it would take several hours to fall to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25">[20:25]</a>.
    *   **Low Earth Orbit (LEO)**: In LEO (around 350 kilometers above Earth), a rod completes a revolution every 90 minutes, moving relative to the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37">[20:37]</a>. This means the time between ordering a strike and impact could be up to 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46">[20:46]</a>. Due to Earth's rotation and orbital drift, hundreds of satellites would be required to ensure a rod is always close to a target within a reasonable strike window (e.g., 30 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03">[21:03]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Launching a hundred 10-ton rods into space would cost billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09">[21:09]</a>. Ongoing maintenance costs would also be significant due to thruster breakdowns and malfunctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16">[21:16]</a>.
*   **Missile Defense**: For missile defense against ICBMs, smaller rods could be used, but hitting an ICBM during its boost phase is extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23">[21:23]</a>. Modern ICBMs split into multiple payloads and decoys after the boost phase, designed to overwhelm defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40">[21:40]</a>. A limited system for interdicting North Korean ICBMs, for example, would require around 400 rods spread among eight orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51">[21:51]</a>. A global defense system would need even more, with calculations suggesting a limited system alone could cost around $300 billion, nearly half the US military's annual budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04">[22:04]</a>. Even then, an enemy could evade the defense by launching several missiles simultaneously, as only one rod would likely be in the correct location at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15">[22:15]</a>.

## Material Properties
Tungsten is the preferred material for Rods from God due to two key properties:
*   **Density**: Tungsten is extremely dense; a cubic meter weighs 19 tons, more than twice the density of steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36">[15:36]</a>. This allows for less volume for a given mass, reducing air resistance during atmospheric passage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48">[15:48]</a>.
*   **Melting Point**: Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal, nearly 3,500 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00">[16:00]</a>. This is crucial because significant heat builds up around the rod as it decelerates through the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08">[16:08]</a>, and tungsten's high melting point means less shielding is required to prevent melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15">[16:15]</a>.

The **shape** of the rod is also important, with a sleek, aerodynamic design being optimal to minimize drag and maintain maximum speed upon impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21">[16:21]</a>.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, Rods from God are currently considered unfeasible to execute in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28">[22:28]</a>. Jerry Pournelle, who originated the idea, later became a science fiction writer, incorporating similar concepts into his book *Footfall* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32">[22:32]</a>. The weapon remains primarily a concept feasible only in science fiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46">[22:46]</a>.

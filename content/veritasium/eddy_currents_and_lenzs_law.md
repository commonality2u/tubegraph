From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Eddy currents are loops of electric current induced within conductors by a changing magnetic field in the conductor according to Faraday's law of induction. These induced currents create their own magnetic fields that oppose the change in the original magnetic flux, a phenomenon known as Lenz's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

## Demonstrations and Effects

### Slowing the Fall of Conductive Materials
When conductive materials, such as copper or aluminum sheets, fall through a strong magnetic field, their descent is significantly slowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. As the metal plate falls, the number of magnetic field lines passing through it changes, inducing eddy currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. If the plate falls towards a north magnetic pole, the induced currents create a north magnetic pole in the plate itself, leading to repulsion that slows its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

### Energy Dissipation as Heat
Eddy currents generated in metal dissipate energy, often as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. Experiments show that a metal plate falling through a strong magnetic field warms up due to these currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. An electromagnetic levitator observed at the Palace of Discovery in Paris uses an alternating current to levitate a plate, and the eddy currents generate so much heat that water can boil on its surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

### The "No You Don't" Law
Lenz's Law is often thought of as the "No You Don't" Law because nature acts to oppose any attempted change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.
*   If a conductive plate is falling, eddy currents are induced to slow its descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
*   If one tries to pick up the plate, a south magnetic pole is induced under the plate, attracting it back to the magnet and making it difficult to lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.
*   Pushing a conductive plate down against the field also proves difficult; speeding it up would increase the rate of change of flux, thereby increasing the opposing induced currents and their magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.
*   A thick aluminum cylinder dropped onto a magnet will resist its fall, and if rolled across the top, it will refuse to roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
*   An aluminum foil-wrapped volleyball passed over or dropped into a strong magnetic field also experiences significant resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

### Projectile Deceleration and Orientation
The fringe field of a 45 Tesla magnet can significantly decelerate and reorient projectiles fired through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. As a projectile enters the magnetic field, induced eddy currents cause it to rotate, remaining oriented along the magnetic field lines. This orientation minimizes the change in magnetic flux experienced by the projectile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. Projectiles containing wire coils connected to LEDs can light up as they cross the field, demonstrating the changing induced currents within the coil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

### Superconductors
In superconductors below their critical temperature, the induced electric energy is not dissipated as light or heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>. With zero electrical resistance, currents induced to oppose a change in flux can persist indefinitely and expel all of the magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. However, some filaments through the material may not be superconducting due to engineered defects that trap magnetic field lines, preventing them from moving. This phenomenon is utilized in systems like the human levitator, where a magnet hovers above a ring of superconductors due to the repulsion created by induced currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>.

While eddy currents demonstrate induced [[magnetic properties and materials|magnetic properties]] in conductors due to changing fields, it's important to distinguish them from inherent magnetic properties like paramagnetism and diamagnetism, which describe how materials are attracted or repelled by a magnetic field regardless of motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>.

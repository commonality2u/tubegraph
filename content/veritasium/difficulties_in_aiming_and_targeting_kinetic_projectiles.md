The concept of kinetic projectiles, specifically "Rods from God," relies on the idea of launching dense, heavy objects from orbit to strike targets on Earth with immense [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]]. While the destructive potential is significant due to the high speeds involved (Mach 10 or about three kilometers per second on impact for an orbital rod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>), achieving accurate targeting presents numerous, seemingly insurmountable challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Experimental Difficulties in Targeting

An experiment involving dropping heavy weights from a helicopter onto a sandcastle city revealed many practical issues with aiming. The initial goal was to drop a 200-kilogram weight from three kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

### Initial Attempts
The first attempt involved dropping a 100-kilogram mass from 500 meters (about 1500 feet) towards a swimming pool, using GPS to try and line up the drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Weight Instability** The weight was observed swinging around "like crazy" up high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Drift and Inaccuracy** The dropped weight went "sideways" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> and missed the target, landing "way past the sandcastle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Despite both the pilot and ground crew believing they were "right on" target, they were not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Aerodynamic Challenges** The experiment highlighted the mistake of not welding fins onto the rods, as cylinders tend to fall on their sides rather than aiming straight down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. A sleek, aerodynamic shape is crucial to minimize drag and maintain speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

### Subsequent Drops
Lowering the drop altitude and using visual targeting improved accuracy slightly, but significant misses continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
*   **Wind Influence** At 100 meters, the wind significantly blew the weight around, making targeting difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Close Calls** While one 200-kilogram drop from 50 meters successfully hit the edge of the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, a drop on the sandcastle city from 100 meters only caused partial damage to a building, hitting it directly but not destroying the whole structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This showed its potential for pinpoint strikes rather than mass devastation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the experiment did not achieve its initial ambitious goals due to extreme aiming difficulties, preventing a full demonstration of the explosive power of [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] from higher altitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## Real-World Feasibility Challenges for Space-Based Weapons

The experimental difficulties underscore the even greater challenges in making "Rods from God" a realistic [[challenges_and_costs_of_spacebased_weapons | space weapon]]:

*   **Steering at Hypersonic Speeds** While theoretically possible to steer a Rod from God using thrusters, adjustable fins, or by changing its center of mass, in practice, aiming an object traveling at hypersonic speeds is incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Communication Issues** Communicating with the rod from the ground or space would be nearly impossible due to the superheated plasma that surrounds it during re-entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

### Orbital Mechanics and Response Time
The required orbit of the [[challenges_and_costs_of_spacebased_weapons | satellites]] carrying the rods significantly impacts response time:
*   **Geostationary Orbit (GEO)** At over 35,000 kilometers away, a rod from GEO would take several hours to fall to Earth, far exceeding the desired 15-minute strike window envisioned by Jerry Pournelle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
*   **Low Earth Orbit (LEO)** Placing rods in LEO (around 350 kilometers above Earth) means the rod moves relative to the ground, completing an orbit every 90 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This means a strike could take up to an hour and a half from the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Satellite Constellation Size** To reduce response time to around 30 minutes, an estimated 10 [[challenges_and_costs_of_spacebased_weapons | satellites]] in LEO would be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. However, due to Earth's rotation and orbital drift, hundreds of [[challenges_and_costs_of_spacebased_weapons | satellites]] would actually be required to ensure a rod is always close to a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Missile Defense Applications
While a smaller rod might suffice for missile defense, this application also faces significant challenges:
*   **Intercepting ICBMs** Successful interception of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) must occur during their boost phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, as modern ICBMs split into multiple payloads and decoys after this phase to overwhelm defense systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **System Scale** To intercept North Korean ICBM launches, the US would need approximately 400 rods spread across eight orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. A global defense system would require even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability to Evasion** Even with a limited system, enemies could evade the defense by launching several missiles simultaneously, as a single rod could only intercept one at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

## Cost and Overall Feasibility
The cost of deploying such a system is prohibitive. Launching 100 rods into space would cost billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, and ongoing maintenance costs for thrusters and malfunctions would be significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. A very limited missile defense system alone has been estimated to cost around $300 billion, nearly half of the US military's annual budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

Due to these extensive technical and financial hurdles, "Rods from God" remains an unfeasible weapon in reality, largely confined to science fiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

Water reservoirs in Los Angeles faced a significant challenge with the formation of Bromate, a carcinogenic substance, in their drinking water supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This issue led to the deployment of 96 million "shade balls" at the LA Reservoir to mitigate the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Problem: Bromate Formation

The core of the problem stemmed from Bromide, a naturally occurring substance found in water associated with salt water, such as that from the California Aqueduct which receives salt water intrusions from the Delta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Bromide itself is harmless and extremely difficult to remove from water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

However, Bromide transforms into Bromate under specific conditions:
*   **Ozone Disinfection**: When water is disinfected with Ozone, Bromide converts into Bromate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Sunlight and Chlorine**: An unfortunate scientific discovery revealed that Bromide combined with Chlorine in bright sunlight also forms Bromate, even more effectively than Ozone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This specific reaction was not part of any prior regulatory scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

Regulations concerning Bromate were introduced around the year 2000, primarily focusing on its formation in treatment plants that use Ozone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Water samples taken directly from filter plants always showed Bromate levels within the regulatory limit of 10 micrograms per liter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Discovery of the Issue

The problem was brought to light by a beverage company in Los Angeles, a customer of the water utility, which reported high levels of Bromate in their water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Initial checks at the filtration plant showed no issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. However, investigations revealed that Bromate levels jumped almost immediately after the water entered the open LA Reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

The combination of naturally occurring Bromide, necessary Chlorine for disinfection, and abundant sunlight in the open reservoir created the perfect conditions for Bromate formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## The Solution: Shade Balls

With Bromide and Chlorine being difficult to remove or essential for water treatment, the only viable option was to eliminate sunlight from the water's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. After considering various options like floating tarps, Dr. Bryan White discovered "bird balls"â€”a product initially used to deter waterfowl from hazardous ponds at mine tailings or airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. These "bird balls" were repurposed and renamed "shade balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Testing and Design
Before mass deployment, the shade balls were tested for their efficacy in reducing Bromate formation. This involved a simple experiment with three kiddie pools: one exposed to sunlight, one covered with a tarp, and one covered with shade balls. The shade balls immediately eliminated the Bromate problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

The shade balls are specifically designed to block light:
*   **Black Color**: They are black to block all light from reaching the water, preventing the Bromate reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Material**: Made from high-density polyethylene, the same food-grade plastic used for milk jugs, they are safe for contact with drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Carbon Black**: The black color comes from carbon black, a material that makes the plastic durable and stable when exposed to the sun for at least 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Other colors tested were unstable and would not last as long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Partially Water-Filled**: The balls are partially filled with water to prevent them from blowing away in high winds, ensuring they stay in the reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This also makes them wobble if they roll, preventing them from bouncing away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Shape**: The spherical shape of the balls is crucial as it prevents them from stacking up or perching on the reservoir banks as water levels fluctuate, ensuring continuous coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Benefits Beyond Bromate Reduction

While the primary purpose of the shade balls is to prevent Bromate formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, they have yielded several additional [[design_and_testing_of_shade_balls_for_reservoirs | benefits]] for water quality and conservation:

*   **Algae Control**: By blocking sunlight, the balls effectively eliminate algae growth, which previously could cause a slight green tinge in the water and required significant chlorine use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Since the deployment of shade balls, chlorine addition has been drastically reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Reduced Evaporation**: Contrary to initial concerns that black balls might heat the water and increase evaporation, they actually reduce evaporation by 80 to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This is due to several factors:
    *   They minimize exposed water surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
    *   They reduce air flow over the water's surface, preventing the removal of moist air and replacement with dryer air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
    *   Although the tops of the balls get hot, the air trapped inside acts as an insulator, preventing heat transfer to the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Measurements showed the water underneath the shade balls is actually cooler than in an uncovered reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Cost Savings**: The cost of the shade balls (around 33-34 cents each) is partially offset by savings in chlorination and reduced evaporation, making them economically beneficial over their lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. They are also recyclable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Bird Deterrence**: The balls effectively deter birds from landing on the reservoir, which previously contributed to water quality issues through droppings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

[[soft_robots_and_their_unique_properties | Soft robots]] based on the "vine" principle offer numerous potential applications, including life-saving scenarios in search and rescue operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Their unique design and capabilities make them particularly well-suited for navigating challenging and hazardous environments.

## Core Advantages in Search and Rescue

Vine robots possess several key characteristics that make them ideal for search and rescue:
*   **Navigation through clutter** They can pass through tight spaces and over sticky surfaces effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. They are also difficult to stop and will continue to move even when encountering clutter, such as in a collapsed building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Resilience to damage** Even if punctured by sharp objects, the robot can continue functioning as long as sufficient air pressure is maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Force generation while remaining soft** These robots can be designed with variable cross-sections, allowing a small body to grow into a much wider section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. A large area, such as a 600-square-inch pillow-like section, can generate significant lifting force with low air pressure (e.g., 600 pounds with 1 PSI, or 1200 pounds with 2 PSI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This capability allows them to lift heavy objects, such as debris in a collapsed building or a car in an accident, while remaining soft and avoiding further injury to trapped individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Cost-effectiveness** Vine robots are made from lightweight, cheap materials, making them nearly free to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This low cost allows for the deployment of multiple robots simultaneously; for example, a hundred robots could be sent into a collapsed building, with success if even one finds a survivor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Equipping for Rescue Operations

For search and rescue missions, vine robots can be equipped with sensors, such as cameras, attached to their front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. The camera can be secured using an end cap, pushed from behind by the robot as it grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Alternatively, a tiny wireless camera can be mounted on an external frame that interlocks with an internal frame inside the robot's pressurized body, preventing it from falling off during growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Active steering is achieved by attaching pneumatic muscles to the robot's sides. These muscles, made from ripstop nylon fabric tubes, inflate and contract, allowing the robot to steer by shortening and lengthening its sides as it extends from the tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This maneuverability is crucial for navigating complex environments in search and rescue scenarios.

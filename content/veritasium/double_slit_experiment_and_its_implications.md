Initially, it was a common misconception that every object follows a single trajectory through space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, this is not the case; everything explores all possible paths simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This applies to light, electrons, protons, and all quantum particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The observation of single, well-defined trajectories is described as "the most convincing illusion nature has ever devised" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## The Principle of Least Action

The understanding of why objects appear to follow a single path stems from a quantity known as "action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

*   **Historical Context**
    *   An earlier, seemingly ad hoc proposal by Maupertuis suggested that everything follows the path that minimizes a quantity called action, defined as mass times velocity times distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   Hamilton later refined this, showing action to be equivalent to the integral over time of kinetic energy minus potential energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   This concept was useful as an alternative way to solve physics problems, especially when Newton's laws became too cumbersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

*   **Birth of Quantum Mechanics**
    *   Around the turn of the 20th century, action became central to quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
    *   Max Planck, while struggling to explain blackbody radiation, made a "desperate" attempt to restrict energy to discrete multiples of a "quantum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
    *   He proposed that the energy of one quantum is directly proportional to its frequency (E=hf), where 'h' is a constant, now known as Planck's constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
    *   Planck's constant has the units of action, making it a "quantum of action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
    *   Planck later suggested that any change in nature would be a whole multiple of this quantum of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
    *   Albert Einstein built on this in 1905, claiming Planck's theory indicated light comes in discrete packets (photons), each with energy HF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
    *   Niels Bohr applied the idea of quantization to angular momentum in atoms (quantized as nh/2π or nħ) to explain atomic stability and the hydrogen spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
    *   Louis de Broglie proposed that if light is both a wave and a particle, then matter particles also have wave nature, with a wavelength defined as Planck's constant divided by momentum (h/mv) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
    *   De Broglie's wave hypothesis explained why Bohr's quantization of angular momentum worked: electrons must exist as standing waves to be bound in atoms, requiring a whole number of wavelengths to fit the orbit circumference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

## Feynman's Path Integral Formulation

The wave nature of quantum objects means they do not have a single path through space, but instead explore all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. This idea is central to Richard Feynman's approach to quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>.

### The [[thomas_youngs_double_slit_experiment | Double Slit Experiment]] Explained

In the [[thomas_youngs_double_slit_experiment | double slit experiment]], electrons are fired one at a time through two slits to be detected on a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Since it's impossible to know which slit the particle went through, quantum mechanics dictates it must go through both simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. To determine the probability of finding a particle at a point on the screen, one adds the amplitude of the wave going through one slit with the amplitude of the wave going through the other slit, and then squares the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

If additional slits are added, the amplitudes from all slits are summed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. The logical extension of this, as implied by a student (anecdotes say Richard Feynman, though the story is fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>), is that if there were infinite slits across the entire space, and then infinite screens, particles must be exploring all possible paths even when traveling through empty space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This logic implies that when a particle goes from one place to another, all possible paths must be considered, including those faster than light, those going back in time, or those traveling to the moon and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

### Why We See Single Trajectories

According to Feynman's path integral formulation, every possible path a particle (or even a macroscopic object) takes from point 1 to point 2 has some chance, and all these paths must be included in calculations with equal weighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. The reason we don't observe all these "crazy paths" is due to wave interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

*   Each path contributes an "amplitude" (represented as a vector or "arrow"), whose direction is determined by its "phase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
*   The phase of a particle wave increases as it follows a path, winding the vector around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.
*   The total increase in phase for a path is directly proportional to the classical action of that path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
*   Because Planck's constant (ħ) is extremely tiny (approximately 10^-34 joule seconds), the action of everyday objects is vastly larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. This causes the phase of ordinary objects on ordinary paths to spin around zillions of times randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.
*   When the amplitudes of almost all possible paths are added, they destructively interfere and cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.
*   The only paths that constructively interfere are those closest to the path of least action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. For these paths, tiny changes in trajectory result in negligible changes to the action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. This is why these are the only paths we perceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

### Emergence of Classical Mechanics

This process explains how classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Objects like a ball or planets orbiting the sun don't have a precise trajectory; instead, they explore all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. However, for massive particles, their actions are large compared to ħ, meaning only paths extremely close to the true path of least action survive, making them appear more particle-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. For smaller particles like electrons or photons, actions are smaller, leading to a wider spread in observed trajectories, which is the wave-like behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

### Experimental Demonstration

The reality of all possible paths can be demonstrated using a diffraction grating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. When light is reflected off a normal mirror, it follows the path where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>. This is because other possible paths' amplitudes cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. However, by covering specific areas of a mirror with tiny strips (a diffraction grating, e.g., 1000 lines per millimeter), one can selectively block portions of the paths, causing other paths to constructively interfere and produce visible reflections at different angles, demonstrating that light indeed explores all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. This phenomenon can even cause a laser beam, normally reflecting at a single spot, to scatter and be seen at unexpected angles, confirming the cancellation of other paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

## Action as the Fundamental Principle

The deep understanding of action and the principle of least action is crucial in modern physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. Theoretical physicists often discuss action rather than energy or forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. All approaches to particle physics are rooted in the principle of least action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.

The process of physics is simplified when one understands this underlying principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. By writing down the correct Lagrangian (which defines the action), the laws of physics emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. This provides a single mathematical framework applicable across classical mechanics, special relativity, and electrodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. The modern hunt for a "theory of everything" is, in essence, a search for the universal Lagrangian that can generate all the laws of physics in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.

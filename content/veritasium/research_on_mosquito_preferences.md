Scientific research indicates that mosquitoes are more attracted to some individuals than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This phenomenon is, at least partially, due to [[genetic_factors_in_mosquito_attraction | genetic factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Mosquito Biology and Lifecycle

Only female mosquitoes bite, as they require blood proteins to produce their eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The mosquito lifecycle, which takes approximately two weeks, involves eggs hatching into wriggly larvae, developing into pupae, and then emerging as flying adult mosquitoes. These adults then seek out vertebrate blood to lay more eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Professor Immo Hansen at New Mexico State University maintains colonies of various mosquito species, some of which are fed exclusively with his own blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Experimental Methods: The Y-Tube Test

The Y-tube test is a method used to assess mosquito attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. In this setup, mosquitoes are placed in a holding chamber and a fan induces a draft through a Y-shaped tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. A "bait" (e.g., a human hand) is inserted into one arm of the Y-tube, while the other arm serves as a control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Mosquitoes' preference is measured by which arm they fly towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Rubbing the hand to get sweat and oils can enhance the bait's attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

One specific strain of mosquito used in these experiments, *Aedes aegypti*, is highly specialized, feeding almost exclusively on humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Anecdotal Experiment: Derek vs. Control
In a Y-tube test, the narrator's (Derek's) hand was placed in one arm while the other had no bait. The results showed strong attraction, with nearly all 20 mosquitoes choosing the narrator's arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Anecdotal Experiment: Derek vs. Raquel
When compared against his wife, Raquel, in a Y-tube test, the narrator continued to be more attractive to mosquitoes, corroborating their real-world experience where he gets bitten more often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. While not scientifically rigorous due to limited repetitions, this experiment suggested the anecdotal finding could be reproduced in lab conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Genetic Basis of Mosquito Attraction

The Y-tube test has been instrumental in discovering that attractiveness to mosquitoes is at least partially genetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Twin Studies
Researchers conducted a study using 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of non-identical (fraternal) female twins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. They measured each twin's mosquito attractiveness using the Y-tube test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Findings showed that mosquito attractiveness was correlated between twins, but this correlation was significantly higher for identical twins compared to fraternal twins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This strongly suggests that [[the_role_of_dna_in_determining_attractiveness_to_mosquitoes | genetics influence how attractive a person is to mosquitoes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### 23andMe Genome-Wide Association Study
A 2017 study, involving 23andMe, utilized data from 16,000 participants who opted into research and self-reported their perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Scientists performed a genome-wide association study, analyzing participants' DNA to identify commonalities among those who reported high mosquito attraction versus those who reported low attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

This research identified seven specific single-letter changes (SNPs) in DNA that appeared to be associated with different levels of attractiveness to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

In the personal experiment involving the narrator and his wife:
*   They shared identical DNA at four of the seven identified locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   At one differing location, Raquel had a letter change associated with significantly *decreased* attractiveness to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   At a second differing location, the narrator had a letter change associated with *decreased* attractiveness to mosquitoes, though its significance was about half of Raquel's protective variant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   At the third significantly differing location, the narrator possessed two copies of a variant associated with *increased* attractiveness to mosquitoes, while Raquel had none <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

Overall, their genetic results were consistent with their observed differences in mosquito attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## Chemical Basis of Mosquito Attraction and Repulsion
While the exact mechanisms by which genetic changes affect mosquito attraction are unclear, it is likely related to the odor or volatile chemicals emitted by the human body, influenced by the skin's microbiome (bacteria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

Mosquitoes are primarily attracted to:
*   **Carbon dioxide**: Individuals with a higher metabolism, those who have exercised, larger people, or pregnant individuals are more likely to attract mosquitoes due to higher CO2 output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Volatile chemicals**: Lactic acid, acetone, and ammonia are also attractive to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Conversely, some naturally occurring chemicals repel mosquitoes or impair their ability to find humans, including:
*   Octanal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>
*   Nonanal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>
*   Decanal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>
*   6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>

## Significance of Mosquito Attraction Research

The heritability of mosquito attractiveness is estimated to be similar to that of height or IQ, highlighting the significant role of genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Understanding this relationship is crucial because mosquitoes have the greatest [[impact_of_mosquitoes_on_human_health | impact on human health]] of all animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Professor Hansen states:
> "Absolutely, there's no question about that. Malaria has killed more people than people have killed people. They are the most dangerous animal in the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>

While estimates vary, mosquitoes have contributed to the deaths of a significant number of humans throughout history, potentially more than any other single cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Over a million people die annually from mosquito-borne illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### [[evolutionary_aspects_of_human_interaction_with_mosquitoes | Evolutionary Aspects]]
Malaria parasites have evolved to alter their human hosts' body chemistry, causing them to produce an odor that increases their attractiveness to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This adaptation facilitates the parasite's transmission, as mosquitoes are the vectors for malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## 23andMe's Role
23andMe, a company named for the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, provides insights into an individual's genetic code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. They were involved in the 2017 study that identified specific DNA locations linked to mosquito attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. While the mosquito attractiveness test is not currently available to customers, 23andMe offers information on physical traits, health aspects, and ancestry based on DNA analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

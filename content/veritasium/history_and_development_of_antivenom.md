Antivenom is a life-saving treatment developed to neutralize the effects of venomous bites and stings. In Australia, where everything "is trying to kill you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, particularly snakes and spiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, institutions like the Australian Reptile Park "milk snakes and spiders so they can use their venom to make antivenom and save lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. While Australia loses 1 to 3 people annually to snake bites, the World Health Organization estimates 120,000 international fatalities per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Australia boasts "some of the best antivenom products anywhere on the planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, and a federally funded program ensures antivenom is free for anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Early Observations and the Concept of Immunity

The idea of developing an antidote to snake venom has roots in observations of natural immunity. In 1870, British military doctor Edward Nicholson, stationed in Burma, noticed local snake handlers intentionally allowing Cobras to bite them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. He believed this practice, which he termed a form of "tattooing," was a deliberate exposure to venom to develop an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Nicholson observed that older handlers were less affected by accidental bites than younger ones, suggesting that this dangerous practice provided some level of protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

## Albert Calmette's Breakthrough

Twenty years later, in Saigon, French medical researcher Albert Calmette, who was vaccinating against smallpox, recognized the significant threat posed by Cobras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. He theorized whether it was possible to create a vaccine for snake bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

Back in Paris, Calmette began a series of experiments:
*   He injected rabbits with a minuscule amount of Cobra venom, starting with just 0.03 milligrams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   Each week, he increased the dose, gradually escalating to 35 milligrams of Cobra venom per injection after eight months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   Despite receiving doses "15 times the normal lethal dose in rabbits," the animals remained "perfectly healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

This demonstrated that the rabbits' immune systems had successfully developed antibodies to neutralize the venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Calmette then aimed to administer these antibodies *after* a bite, rather than as a preventative vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. He drew blood from a venom-resistant rabbit, isolated the serum (which contains antibodies), and injected it into a rabbit that had never been exposed to venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. This naive rabbit subsequently survived an injection of "twice the lethal dose of Cobra venom," proving that immunity could be transferred from one animal to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This marked the creation of the first antivenom, or "antivenin," as Calmette called it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

## Modern Antivenom Production

"To this day, antivenoms are made in much the same way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. The process typically involves:
1.  **Venom Collection**: Venom is collected from snakes, such as at the Australian Reptile Park, and frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
2.  **Dilution and Injection**: The collected venom is diluted and injected into a donor animal, commonly a horse, due to their size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
3.  **Immunity Development**: Over a period of months, the dose is gradually increased, allowing the horse to build up immunity to the venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
4.  **Antibody Isolation**: Blood is drawn from the immunized horse, and only the plasma, containing the life-saving antibodies, is isolated. The red blood cells are returned to the horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

Antivenom is effective in humans because the antibodies produced by horses are very similar to those produced by humans, allowing them to bind to toxic compounds and neutralize them within our bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## [[Challenges and innovations in antivenom production | Challenges and Future Innovations]]

Despite its effectiveness, the current method of antivenom production faces several challenges:
*   **Danger**: Collecting venom is inherently dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Donor Animals**: The process involves many donor animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Allergic Reactions**: Some individuals are allergic to antivenom, as evidenced by one handler's severe anaphylactic reaction requiring adrenaline alongside further antivenom doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

Scientists are actively exploring new possibilities, including producing antivenom using genetically modified bacteria. This approach would allow for the production of specific antibodies tailored to neutralize each toxin within a venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. However, for now, traditional methods remain the standard for antivenom production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. The dedication of those involved in [[venom_extraction_and_antivenom_production_process | venom extraction and antivenom production]] "saves countless lives all around the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

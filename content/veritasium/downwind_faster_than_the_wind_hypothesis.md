From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

The [[downwind_faster_than_the_wind_debate | downwind faster than the wind debate]] centers on the counterintuitive claim that a wind-powered vehicle can travel directly downwind faster than the wind itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This concept was publicly challenged by UCLA Physics Professor Alex Kusenko, leading to a $10,000 wager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The vehicle in question, known as Blackbird, operates without a motor, batteries, or any energy source other than the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## The Challenge

Professor Alex Kusenko's primary arguments against the hypothesis were presented publicly, with witnesses including Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, and Sean Carroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. His main points of contention included:

### Gusts and Inertia
Kusenko suggested that any observed speed exceeding wind speed was due to the vehicle being operated in a gusty wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. He posited that an initial gust would push the car to a high speed, and then as the wind speed dropped, the car would momentarily move faster than the wind due to inertia, but would necessarily be decelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. He theorized that whenever the car's velocity was faster than the wind, its acceleration would be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For record attempts, he argued, one would simply "sample that gusty wind" until a strong gust allowed a temporary high speed, explaining high speed multipliers like 2.8 times wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Wind Gradient
Professor Kusenko also pointed out that wind speed varies with height due to interactions with the ground, creating a wind gradient where wind travels slower close to the ground and faster higher up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. He noted that the wind in the video was measured at about 1 to 1.5 meters, while the propeller extended up to 3 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. He estimated that the wind speed at the propeller's height could be 10-15% higher than at the measurement point, potentially making the car appear faster than the measured wind, while still being slower than the wind at the propeller itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. He considered this a "small effect" but one that could make "more frequent" observations of apparent faster-than-wind speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Treadmill Test Criticisms
Tests conducted on a treadmill, simulating a perfectly steady tailwind in still air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, were also questioned. Kusenko suggested that fluctuating treadmill speeds or unconscious human bias from the operator could influence the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Theoretical Flaws
Kusenko identified a perceived problem in existing theoretical analyses, such as one by MIT Aero Professor Mark Drela. He noted that the equation for net force included the difference between car and wind speeds in the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This implied that when the car traveled exactly at wind speed, an "infinite force" would be generated, which he argued was nonsensical and potentially dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. His own analysis concluded that there was "no way for the car to accelerate at, or above wind speed," stating that acceleration would always be negative under such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## The Defense: Evidence and Explanation

In response to these challenges, the proponent of the hypothesis provided further experimental evidence and a detailed explanation of the vehicle's [[physics_of_windpowered_vehicles | physics of windpowered vehicles]]:

### Experimental Evidence

*   **Multi-height Tell-tales:** To counter the wind gradient argument, experiments were conducted with tell-tales mounted on fishing poles at various heights, including to the sides and above the propeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. All tell-tales, even the highest ones, eventually flipped backward, demonstrating that every part of the vehicle was moving faster than the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Sustained Acceleration:** Analysis of video footage using the rotation of the back wheel showed that the car continued to accelerate even after the tell-tales flipped backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Furthermore, the tell-tale consistently pointed straight back for over 30 seconds, indicating sustained faster-than-wind travel, not momentary gusts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Record-Setting Run:** When Blackbird achieved its record speed of 27.7 miles per hour in a 10 mile per hour tailwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, it was still accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. This was verified by multiple GPS units in the car and wind speed measurements taken at the propeller's height at various locations over a 10-second period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Physics Olympiad Endorsement:** The U.S. Physics Olympiad Semifinal Exam in 2013 included questions about Blackbird, concluding that both downwind and upwind modes of operation were possible, and with sufficiently low energy loss, "any speed is possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

### Mechanism Explanation ([[physics_of_windpowered_vehicles | Physics of Windpowered Vehicles]])

The car's ability to go downwind faster than the wind stems from its unique design and power transfer:

*   **Propeller Operation:** Contrary to common intuition, the propeller does not work like a windmill, turning in the direction the tailwind pushes it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Instead, it turns in the *opposite* direction, functioning like a fan that pushes air backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Power Transfer and Force Amplification:** This fan is powered by the wheels, connected by a bike chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. The key insight lies in the power transfer:
    *   Power is input into the system by the ground moving underneath the car via the wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This power is the force of the ground on the wheels multiplied by the car's velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
    *   Work is done on the air at the propeller as it pushes air backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. The power output equals the force of the prop on the air times the speed of the car minus the speed of the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. The propeller moves slower through the air due to the tailwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
    *   Assuming no losses, the power in at the wheels equals the power out at the propeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. From this, it can be shown that the thrust force applied by the propeller pushing air backward will be greater than the backward force on the wheels that drives the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Lever/Pulley Analogy:** The car operates like a mechanical lever or pulley system. It applies a small force to the wheels over a larger distance (the car's travel speed), which allows the propeller to apply a larger force over a smaller distance (its speed relative to the air) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This is analogous to riding a bike uphill: fast, small force on pedals translates to slow, large force on wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This demonstrates a key principle of [[physics_and_aerodynamic_principles | physics and aerodynamic principles]] related to power and gearing.

### Addressing the Divide by Zero Problem

The apparent "divide by zero" problem in theoretical equations, where the force seems infinite when the car's speed equals wind speed, is resolved by two factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>:
1.  **Theoretical Expectation:** This is expected with any lever or pulley where one arm's effective length becomes zero; lifting an infinite weight implies zero displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
2.  **Propeller Efficiency Term:** In practice, a propeller efficiency term is introduced, which is "well-defined in the zero speed limit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This more complete formula eliminates the divide by zero issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Physical Model Demonstration

A simplified cart model with a large wheel rolling on two smaller spools was used to illustrate the core principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. When a board is pushed to the right, simulating wind, the cart moves down the board faster than the board itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Crucially, the big wheel rotates in the opposite direction of the board's push, mimicking Blackbird's propeller pushing back against the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### Replicable Model Confirmation

YouTube maker Xyla Foxlin designed and built a working model downwind cart, with her fourth version demonstrating spectacular functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This model was designed for replication using a 3D printer and simple materials, providing further tangible evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

## Historical Context

The concept of a [[downwind_faster_than_the_wind_debate | downwind faster than the wind]] vehicle is not new. Andrew Bauer built the first successful downwind cart in 1969 to settle a friendly wager with Aero Engineer Apolo Smith, inspired by a student paper from 20 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Rick Cavallaro, the builder of Blackbird, developed his cart independently, unaware of previous efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Other analyses on similar vehicles have been published under names like the "push-me pull-you boat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

Following the presentation of the evidence and detailed explanations, Professor Alex Kusenko conceded the bet and transferred $10,000, acknowledging the validity of the hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. The proponent of the hypothesis chose to invest the winnings in science communication through a video competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. The experience underscored the value of disagreements in science as opportunities for learning and for refining explanations to make evidence overwhelmingly convincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

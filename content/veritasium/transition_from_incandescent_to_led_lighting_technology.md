## The Enduring Incandescent and the Rise of Obsolescence

For a period, it seemed that the lifespan of light bulbs was intentionally shortened, a concept that ran contrary to the idea of continuous improvement in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. This notion stemmed from a belief that older light bulbs were superior and were later made worse on purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

### The Centennial Bulb

One notable example is the incandescent light bulb at Livermore Fire Station number six, which is recognized as the longest continuously operating light bulb in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. This bulb has been lit for 120 years, having been switched on in 1901 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Manufactured by hand shortly after commercial light bulbs were first invented, it has operated for over a million hours, far exceeding the intended lifespan of modern bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Its remarkable longevity is attributed to being made before the "cartel era" and running consistently at a low power of four or five watts, primarily as a nightlight, which reduced thermal stress on the filament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

### Early Incandescent Technology

The design of a typical incandescent bulb involves passing an electric current through a material, causing it to heat up and glow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. However, less than 5% of the electrical energy is converted into light, with the remaining 95% released as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Filaments can reach temperatures of up to 2,800 Kelvin, half as hot as the sun's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. To prevent materials from melting or burning, Warren De la Rue proposed placing the filament in a vacuum bulb in the 1840s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

By 1879, Thomas Edison developed a bulb with a cotton thread filament that lasted 14 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Over time, filaments evolved from carbon to tungsten, a material with a very high melting point, significantly increasing bulb lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. By the early 1920s, average bulb lifetimes reached around 2,000 hours, with some lasting up to 2,500 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

### The [[history_of_the_phoebus_cartel_and_its_impact_on_light_bulb_longevity | Phoebus Cartel]] and [[planned_obsolescence_in_consumer_products | Planned Obsolescence]]

A significant shift occurred when the lifespan of light bulbs ceased to increase and began to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. In December 1924, major light bulb manufacturers, including Phillips, International General Electric, Tokyo Electric, OSRAM, and Associated Electric, formed the [[history_of_the_phoebus_cartel_and_its_impact_on_light_bulb_longevity | Phoebus Cartel]] in Geneva, Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Named after the Greek God of light, this cartel aimed to control the global supply of light bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

The cartel's primary motivation was to counteract the threat of longer-lasting bulbs, which were eating into sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. For instance, OSRAM's sales dropped significantly from 63 million bulbs in 1923 to 28 million in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. To address this, the cartel members collectively agreed to reduce the lifespan of their bulbs to 1,000 hours, nearly halving the existing average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

To enforce this, manufacturers submitted sample bulbs for testing; companies were fined if their bulbs lasted significantly longer than 1,000 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Engineers, who previously worked on extending bulb life, were now tasked with finding ways to shorten it, experimenting with different materials, filament shapes, and thinner connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. As a result, the average lifespan steadily decreased, reaching 1,205 hours by 1934 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. This strategy led to a 25% increase in sales for cartel members in the four years after 1926, while prices remained largely unchanged despite lower component costs, boosting profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

The [[history_of_the_phoebus_cartel_and_its_impact_on_light_bulb_longevity | Phoebus Cartel]] claimed its purpose was standardization and efficiency, notably establishing the common screw thread standard used globally today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. However, evidence suggests its primary motivation was profit and increased sales, not consumer benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. Although initially planned to last until 1955, the cartel struggled with competition and non-compliance among members, ultimately collapsing with the outbreak of World War II in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. Despite its demise, its methods of intentionally shortening product lifespans, known as [[planned_obsolescence_in_consumer_products | planned obsolescence]], continue to be practiced by various companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

## The Modern Era: Transition to LED Lighting

In the last two decades, lighting technology has seen a rapid advancement, moving from incandescent bulbs, which remained largely unchanged for a century, to compact fluorescent (CFL) and now to [[impact_of_led_technology_on_modern_lighting | LED technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.

Modern LED bulbs represent a significant technological leap. They use just a tenth of the energy of incandescent bulbs and can last anywhere from 10 to 50 times longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>. This dramatic increase in longevity and efficiency means that an LED bulb installed in a home is more likely to outlast the ownership of the house itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. This advancement effectively brings back the concept of an "everlasting light bulb" through [[impact_of_led_technology_on_modern_lighting | technological obsolescence]], where superior technology naturally replaces older, less efficient products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.

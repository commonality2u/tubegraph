Nitinol, a unique metal, is enabling the reinvention of the wheel for space exploration and terrestrial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This metal exhibits properties akin to magic, capable of adjusting its atomic arrangement to return to a predefined shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> and converting between mechanical and thermal energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It can also stretch up to 30 times more than ordinary metals and still revert to its original size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Need for Advanced Wheel Technology

Traditional pneumatic rubber tires are unsuitable for extreme space environments due to challenges like extreme temperature fluctuations and the absence of atmospheric pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Without confining pressure, rubber tires could explode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Additionally, rubber becomes brittle at extreme lows, transitioning from flexible to rigid at around -90 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. For instance, on the Moon, temperatures can range from 250 degrees Fahrenheit above zero in sunlight to 250 degrees Fahrenheit below zero in shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

To date, most wheels for planetary exploration have been made of hard metal, such as the aluminum wheels used on the Curiosity rover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. These wheels are machined from a single billet to avoid fasteners or welds that could be failure points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. However, the high cost of launching mass into space necessitates lightweight designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The Curiosity rover's wheel skin was made very thin, at 0.7 millimeters, to meet mass limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Despite structural members (grousers) for strength and traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, these thin skins suffered damage from aggressive terrain, resulting in significant holes and cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. While the rover continued its mission, the damage affected its mobility and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Ordinary metals can only withstand elastic strain of about 0.3 to 0.8% before undergoing plastic deformation (permanent change) or fracturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Components of space vehicles are designed to never exceed this limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Earlier efforts included the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) wheels, which used a woven steel wire structure called a pantograph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. These wheels also had tread strips to prevent sinking and an internal "bump stop" to limit deformation and prevent plastic deformation of the steel mesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. While effective for short Apollo missions (farthest journey: 36 km) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, repeated use on Earth showed performance degradation over time due to permanent deformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Discovery and Properties of Nitinol

The search for a material that is strong and durable like steel but can endure much more strain without permanently deforming led to nitinol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Discovery

[[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | Nitinol]] was discovered in 1961 at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory during experiments with nickel and titanium alloys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. A sample that had been worked, heated, and cooled repeatedly was shown to a pipe smoker, who applied heat from his lighter. The material unexpectedly changed shape, leading to further investigations and its naming: nickel (Ni), titanium (Ti), and Naval Ordnance Laboratory (NOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Shape Memory Effect

[[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | Nitinol]]'s ability to change shape is due to a solid-state phase change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
1.  **Austenite Phase**: When heated, nitinol atoms are arranged in a cubic lattice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This is the "parent" or "memory" shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
2.  **Twinned Martensite**: Upon cooling, atoms transition into a messier, lower-symmetry arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. In this phase, the material can be deformed by applying stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
3.  **Detwinned Martensite**: Unlike ordinary metals, this deformation doesn't break atomic bonds; instead, the crystal structure changes again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Most of this deformation remains when stress is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
4.  **Shape Recovery**: When the material is heated back up, the atoms return to their original locations in the austenite phase, causing the material to revert to its original predefined shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

This [[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | shape memory effect]] allows for various [[applications_of_shape_memory_alloys_in_various_fields | applications]], such as medical stents that can be crushed for insertion and then expand back into shape inside the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Shape memory alloys can also act as actuators, generating significant forces when heated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Superelasticity (Pseudoelasticity)

[[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | Shape memory alloys]] like [[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | nitinol]] possess another unique property: superelasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. They can stretch up to 8% of their length and still spring back to their original size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. This occurs when the nitinol is in its austenite phase, with its transition temperature below room temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Applying stress, even without temperature change, forces the crystal structure to change from austenite to detwinned martensite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. When the stress is removed, the atoms spring back to the austenite phase, restoring the material to its original configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. This stress-induced phase change also involves heat exchange, being exothermic when deformed and endothermic upon recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. This property is being investigated for [[applications_of_shape_memory_alloys_in_various_fields | elastocalorics]], for uses like heat pumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

## Nitinol Wheels: Design and Advantages

[[nasas_airless_tires_for_space_missions | NASA's airless tires for space missions]] are made by weaving [[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | nitinol]] springs into a mesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. This tedious process involves screwing hundreds of nitinol springs together for a single tire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

The advantages of nitinol wheels are significant:

*   **Puncture Resistance**: These tires do not require air pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. They can withstand punctures from a bed of nails or even a bullet without loss of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Durability and Flexibility**: [[shape_memory_alloys_and_nitinol | Nitinol]]'s superelasticity allows the tire to deform significantly (up to 8%) without permanent damage, crucial for long space missions over rough terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. This is a vast improvement over ordinary metals' 0.3-0.8% elastic limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Shock Absorption and Damping**: The material's ability to dissipate energy during stress-induced phase changes acts like a damper, potentially making the tire a complete suspension system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. This simplifies vehicle construction for space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   **Increased Load-Carrying Capacity**: By using an internal bump stop element to transfer load 360 degrees around the tire, the load-carrying capacity is significantly increased without adding mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Temperature Tolerance**: Nitinol's properties hold up in extreme temperature ranges, unlike rubber which becomes brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Testing and Terrestrial Applications

[[nasas_airless_tires_for_space_missions | Nitinol wheels]] are extensively tested on terrain endurance rigs that simulate the surfaces of the Moon and Mars, including sand and various rock sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. These tests ensure the wheels can support the weight of a vehicle and crew while maintaining flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

Beyond space, [[nasas_airless_tires_for_space_missions | nitinol tires]] are being considered for terrestrial [[applications_of_shape_memory_alloys_in_various_fields | applications]], such as [[design_enhancements_for_bicycle_stability | bicycle tires]] and aircraft tires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. For aircraft, conventional tires require extremely high pressurization (300-400 psi) and constant maintenance to check air pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. Nitinol tires eliminate these issues, providing a structural system that doesn't rely on air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. For vehicles like a Jeep, they prevent flat tires and improve fuel economy by never being underinflated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

[[nasas_airless_tires_for_space_missions | NASA's nitinol tires]] are designed to last the entire lifetime of a rover mission, even on rough terrains like Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>, showcasing their exceptional durability and utility.

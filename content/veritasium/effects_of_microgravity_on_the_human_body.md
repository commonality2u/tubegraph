Simulating conditions of space travel, such as those on a journey to Mars, offers insights into the [[challenges_of_microgravity_in_space_travel | effects of microgravity]] on the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These simulations, like those performed on a "vomit comet" plane, create a microgravity environment by flying in a series of parabolic arcs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The plane can also simulate the [[differences_in_gravity_between_earth_moon_and_mars | gravity on other bodies]] like the Moon and Mars by modifying the parabola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Musculoskeletal System

### Muscle Atrophy
On a journey to Mars, which could last eight months, and in microgravity environments like the International Space Station, muscles would weaken and shrink, a process known as atrophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Studies have shown that muscle mass can decrease by up to 20% on space flights lasting just 5 to 11 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The feeling of lifting an arm, which normally provides a slight workout due to its weight (about 5% of body weight), is lost in microgravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Bone Density Loss
The lack of weight pushing on bones in microgravity also leads to a decrease in bone density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Astronauts can lose 1 to 2% of bone mass per month, primarily in their lower extremities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This rate of bone loss is more than 10 times faster than what people on Earth experience through osteoporosis as they age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### [[solutions_for_exercising_and_maintaining_health_in_space | Exercise in Space]]
Due to these effects, exercise is crucial. However, lifting weights is largely ineffective in microgravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Astronauts instead rely on elastic resistance; for example, they are elastically tethered to a treadmill and typically exercise two and a half hours every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. On Mars, where gravity is about 37% of Earth's, a spacesuit weighing 310 pounds would make a person feel about as heavy as they are on Earth, which could help maintain muscle and bone mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Daily Life Challenges

In weightless conditions, other forces, such as the surface tension of water, become significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This makes everyday activities significantly more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

*   Washing one's face becomes difficult due to water's strong surface tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   Dealing with liquids in microgravity makes showering, brushing teeth, and using the bathroom much harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Sensory and Physiological Effects

### Visual Phenomena
Astronauts on orbit sometimes report seeing flashes of light with their eyes closed, even when not yet asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This is believed to be a human body reaction to [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation from the universe]], specifically heavy particles or individual bursts of energy passing through the eyeball or optic nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Motion Sickness
Differences in gravity can cause nausea, as human bodies are not necessarily evolved for these varied gravitational situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This can lead to discomfort during periods of changing gravity, such as during parabolic flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### [[gyroscopic_precession_and_its_effects | Intermediate Axis Theorem]]
Beyond physiological effects, the absence of Earth's gravity also highlights other physical phenomena. For instance, an object spun about its intermediate axis in microgravity demonstrates the [[gyroscopic_precession_and_its_effects | intermediate axis theorem]], where any tiny disturbance causes it to rotate about another axis as well, leading to a "flipping" motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This effect has been observed with T-bar handles on the space station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Conclusion

The difficulties presented by microgravity and different gravitational environments are significant challenges to be overcome for humans to become a multi-planetary species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Our bodies evolved for millions of years in Earth's 9.8 m/sÂ² gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. If humanity were to establish colonies and live on Mars, human evolution might take very different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

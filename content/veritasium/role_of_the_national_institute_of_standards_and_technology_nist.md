The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) operates a U.S. government warehouse that sells a vast array of items, from blueberries and steel to domestic sludge and standard bullets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The core purpose behind this diverse inventory is to provide "truth in a bottle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, ensuring accuracy and consistency across various industries and research fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Standard Reference Materials (SRMs)

NIST's primary function is to create and distribute **Standard Reference Materials (SRMs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. These are perfectly characterized samples of materials with painstakingly identified quantities of various compounds and specified uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The knowledge of exactly what is in these materials is what drives their high cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. [[importance_and_cost_of_standard_reference_materials | Standard Reference Materials]] are crucial for calibration and validation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, ensuring that equipment and analytical techniques used by manufacturers and researchers yield accurate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Examples of SRMs and their Applications

NIST offers nearly 1,300 different SRMs, catering to a wide range of needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. [[use_of_standard_reference_materials_in_various_industries | Use of standard reference materials in various industries]] is extensive, covering areas such as:

### Food Safety & Nutrition
*   **Peanut Butter:** One of the most expensive jars of peanut butter in the world, costing around a thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. It is not for consumption due to its age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Its purpose is to help manufacturers calibrate their equipment to accurately measure ingredients like fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, and detect dangerous contaminants like aflatoxins, which are carcinogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The FDA may encourage commercial laboratories to use this SRM to ensure accurate measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Domestic Sludge:** This dried, fine powder is derived from solid material extracted during wastewater treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. It serves as a record of what has been flushed and allows researchers to examine it for traces of toxins or heavy metals, aiding environmental monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   **Animal Tissues and Food Items:** Includes mussel, dolphin, whale, and bird samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, as well as apple and peach leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For general food analysis, NIST provides a "standard trout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> and "Meat Homogenate," a thoroughly mixed and ground meat product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. They have around 30 different food items covering a "food triangle" based on carbohydrate, fat, and protein content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Typical Diet:** A freeze-dried, light gray powder representing all the nutritional components an average American consumes, including sugar, proteins, vitamins, and fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Industrial Quality Control
*   **Steel:** One of NIST's earliest and most important SRMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Developed in the early 1900s to address quality issues in steel used for rail cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, these samples allowed foundries to compare their steel's constituent parts (e.g., chrome, iron, carbon) to a known standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Charpies:** NIST's best-selling product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, these are standard pieces of metal with a V-notch used in a Charpy impact test to determine steel's strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Companies globally must annually check their materials against NIST's Charpies, especially for steel used in pipelines, defense industries (tanks), or nuclear waste storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. NIST sells approximately 8,000 Charpies a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Limestone:** Standard Sample Number One, NIST's very first product from 110 years ago, is still sold at 40 to 50 units annually due to its continued popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

### Product Safety
*   **Cigarettes:** Standard cigarettes were produced to help manufacturers determine the flammability of materials like mattresses and bed clothes when exposed to a combustible source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. These standards, combined with regulations and educational campaigns, have saved many lives by reducing fire deaths caused by smoking materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Forensics
*   **Standard Bullet:** A bullet with manufactured, nano-indentations that replicate the rifling marks from a gun barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Forensic labs use this SRM to validate their equipment when measuring grooves to match bullets from crime scenes to suspected weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Environmental Monitoring
*   **House Dust:** Collected from maid services, hotels, and homes, this SRM helps identify dangerous contaminants that humans are exposed to in their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
*   **Lead Paint:** NIST offers several types of lead paint SRMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   **Glacier Water from Greenland:** This rare SRM has limited distribution (one unit per customer every three years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   **Soil Samples from New Jersey and Montana:** Certified for toxic elements, these samples were collected from contaminated industrial sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### Health & Research
*   **Human Tissue:** NIST also collects and stores samples of human tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Human Poop Product:** Set to launch soon, this SRM will support measurements of metabolites in fecal matter, which is an incredibly difficult matrix to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. It is relevant to understanding the microbiome and its importance to overall health and mental attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Living Standard Reference Material:** NIST is preparing to launch its first living SRM, which will be hamster ovary cells that produce monoclonal antibodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Monoclonal antibodies are significant, accounting for five of the top ten selling drugs and over $75 billion in annual sales worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
*   **Monkeypox DNA:** NIST rapidly created a positive control reference for monkeypox DNA in just 30 days to aid in diagnosing the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

## How SRMs are Created

Creating an SRM involves significant effort and time. For example, generic peanut butter is homogenized so carefully that each jar contains exactly the same substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. NIST scientists then take years to painstakingly identify the quantities of all different compounds with specified uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The objective is to provide a matrix that closely matches the target material in composition and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, working closely with industry to determine the specific mixes needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## NIST's Operations and Reach

NIST's warehouse spans approximately 20,000 square feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. It operates as a business, generating $20 million annually and selling about 30,000 units per year, with half of sales being international <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. While their products can be searched on shop.nist.gov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, NIST controls who they sell to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

The vast and often unexpected range of SRMs provided by NIST underscores its fundamental role in ensuring accuracy and consistency across modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. From the nutritional information on food labels to the structural integrity of buildings and the reliability of medical tests, a small army of people at NIST diligently works to ensure that what we perceive and interact with in the world aligns with established standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

Aerogel, often called the world's lightest solid, possesses extraordinary [[properties of aerogel]] that make it highly valuable for various applications, particularly in thermal insulation and waterproofing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This material, first recognized by its inventor Samuel Kistler in 1931, also emits a distinctive metallic ring when struck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## [[Aerogel as a thermal insulator]]

[[Aerogel as a thermal insulator]] is one of its most remarkable properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Despite its excellent insulating capabilities, traditional aerogel is known to be quite brittle and breaks easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Extreme Heat Insulation Demonstration

To showcase aerogel's [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel]], a demonstration involved applying a paste made of silica aerogel particles and a non-flammable binder to a finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. A blowtorch, capable of reaching temperatures between 1500 and 2000 degrees Celsius, was then directed at the aerogel-coated finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

During this intense heat exposure, the finger behind the thin aerogel layer felt only slightly warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Thermal imaging revealed that the aerogel surface reached temperatures between 881 and 907 degrees Celsius, yet the insulating effect prevented the heat from significantly reaching the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Thermal Conductivity

Silica aerogel typically has a thermal conductivity of about 15 milliwatts per meter Kelvin, making it two to three times more insulating than styrofoam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Other types, like polyimide aerogel developed by NASA, offer thermal conductivity between 20 and 26 milliwatts per meter Kelvin, still one and a half to two times better than styrofoam, and are non-flammable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Improving Usability and Practical Applications

To overcome the [[challenges_of_working_with_brittle_aerogel]] and make aerogel more usable, it can be incorporated into composite materials, such as blankets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. These blankets, often made by infusing fiberglass with aerogel, allow the material to be flexed, cut, sewn, and wrapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The amorphous silica dust produced from these composites is considered safe and readily expelled by the body, unlike substances such as asbestos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

These aerogel blankets are already in [[practical_applications_of_aerogel]] for insulating subsea oil pipelines and refineries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. A one-centimeter thick aerogel blanket provides the same insulation as three centimeters of mineral wool or fiberglass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. In the [[future_uses_of_aerogel_in_clothing_and_space_technology]], this new type of aerogel blanket may be found in astronaut suits or apparel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Applications in Waterproofing

Aerogel can also be used for waterproofing, as demonstrated by coating the skin with aerogel particles to create a temporary waterproof layer in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This effect is achieved by trapping a thin layer of air next to the skin, which also causes light to reflect off the water-air interface in what is called total internal reflection, making the skin appear silvery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This layer of extra air can even increase buoyancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Hydrophilic vs. Hydrophobic Aerogel

Normally, silica aerogel is hydrophilic, meaning it absorbs liquid and its structure can collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This absorption capability is due to two main reasons:
1.  **High Surface Area**: Aerogel's nano-scale sponge-like structure contains a vast amount of surface area; an ice cube-sized piece can have half a football field of surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This makes it excellent at absorbing many molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
2.  **OH Groups**: The structure is covered with hydroxyl (OH) groups, which attract water molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### [[Practical applications of aerogel]] of Hydrophilic Aerogel

The absorbent nature of hydrophilic aerogel has several [[practical_applications_of_aerogel]]:
*   **Physical Insecticide**: It can act as a physical insecticide by sticking to an insect's outer skin and drawing out moisture and oils, causing the insect to dry out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Museum Cases**: Companies like Opium, which made the case for the Mona Lisa, are interested in using aerogel as a passive moisture regulator in museum cases. It absorbs moisture when humidity increases and releases it when it decreases, maintaining a stable environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Mars Quake Detection**: Aerogel containing zeolite particles was developed for NASA's InSight mission to detect Mars quakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. These zeolite particles can absorb moisture even at very low pressures, helping to maintain the exceptional vacuum required inside the seismometers, which are crucial for detecting subtle motions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This vacuum ball system is lightweight and requires no power, enabling the mission to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Aerogel can absorb up to 25 times its weight in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Creating Hydrophobic Aerogel

To make aerogel repel water, a reactive chemical called a hydrophobe is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This chemical spontaneously rearranges with the OH groups on the aerogel's surface, creating large non-polar groups that repel water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. By replacing only about 30% of the OH groups, aerogel can become perfectly water-repellent, causing water to bounce off without penetrating, allowing it to sit on water for months without degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

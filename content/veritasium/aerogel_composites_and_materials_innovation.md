[[aerogel_properties_and_composition | Aerogel]], known as the world's lightest solid, is an excellent [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | thermal insulator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, it is naturally brittle and easily breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. To overcome this limitation and make [[applications_and_uses_of_aerogel | aerogel]] more usable, various composite materials and innovations have been developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Enhancing Usability and Properties

### Aerogel Pastes
One way to make [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] more workable is to combine its particles with a non-flammable binder to form a paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This paste retains the remarkable [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | insulating properties]] of [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]], allowing it to withstand extreme temperatures, such as a blowtorch flame reaching between 1,500°C and 2,000°C, while the material on skin remains only warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Waterproofing with Hydrophobic Aerogel
Naturally, normal silica [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] is hydrophilic, meaning it readily absorbs water due to its nanoscopic, sponge-like structure with extensive surface area (an ice cube-sized piece can have half a football field of surface area) and numerous O-H groups that attract water molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. While this absorption capability is useful for certain [[applications_and_uses_of_aerogel | applications]] like museum moisture regulation and maintaining vacuum for Mars quakes detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, it makes the material prone to irreversible structural collapse when wetted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

To create waterproof [[hydrophobic_and_hydrophilic_characteristics_of_aerogel | aerogel]], a reactive chemical hydrophobe is used to replace about 30% of the O-H groups on the [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]]'s internal surface with large non-polar groups that repel water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This modified [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] becomes completely impervious to water, allowing it to sit on water for months without degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. When applied to skin, it creates a thin layer of air that prevents direct water contact, leading to a unique "silvery" appearance due to total internal reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Diverse Aerogel Materials
While silica [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] is common, [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogels]] can be made from various materials, all of which are nanostructured with nano-sized pores (around 20 nanometers) and over 50% air, contributing to their lightweight nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Polymer Aerogels**: Some [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogels]] are made of polymers, offering a trade-off between thermal and mechanical properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. For example, a polyimide [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] (derived from NASA chemistry) is a great insulating material that is non-flammable and feels like wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Its thermal conductivity is typically 20 to 26 milliwatts per meter Kelvin, making it 1.5 to 2 times more insulating than Styrofoam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Fiberglass Aerogel Composites**: To improve workability and flexibility, [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] can be incorporated into composite materials like blankets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. A fiberglass [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] composite infuses [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] into fiberglass, allowing the material to be flexed, cut, sewn, and wrapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This composite is safe, as the amorphous silica dust it sheds is easily captured and expelled by the body, unlike asbestos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. A one-centimeter thick blanket of this material provides the same insulation as three centimeters of mineral wool or fiberglass alone, making it a tremendously better insulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## Applications of Aerogel Composites

The [[development_and_future_applications_of_aerogel | development]] of these composite forms has expanded the [[applications_and_uses_of_aerogel | uses]] of [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] in various fields:
*   **Wearable Technology and Apparel**: Future applications may include [[applications_in_aerospace_and_space_technology | astronaut suits]] or other apparel due to their excellent [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | insulating properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Industrial Insulation**: The fiberglass [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] blanket is used to insulate subsea oil pipelines, refineries, and other industrial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Pest Control**: The [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]]'s high surface area makes it suitable as a physical insecticide. It absorbs moisture and oils from an insect's outer skin, causing it to dry out, similar to putting salt on a slug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Museum Preservation**: [[properties_of_aerogel | Aerogels]] are used as passive moisture regulators in museum cases, such as those made for the Mona Lisa, by absorbing excess moisture and releasing it when humidity drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **[[uses_of_aerogel_in_space_exploration | Space Exploration]]**: Zeolite particles dispersed throughout [[properties_of_aerogel | aerogel]] allow it to absorb moisture even at very low pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This innovation enabled the NASA Insight mission to detect Mars quakes by maintaining an exceptional vacuum within small seismometers, essentially acting as a lightweight, power-free "vacuum ball" that pulls outgassing moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

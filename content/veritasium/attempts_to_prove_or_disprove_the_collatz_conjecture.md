The [[collatz_conjecture_overview | Collatz Conjecture]] is considered one of the most dangerous problems in mathematics, with young mathematicians often warned not to spend their time on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite its simple premise, not even the world's best mathematicians have been able to solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Paul Erdos, a renowned mathematician, famously stated, "Mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Collatz Rules and Conjecture

The [[collatz_conjecture_overview | Collatz Conjecture]], also known by many other names like the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, or simply 3N+1, proposes a simple set of rules for any positive integer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>:
*   If the number is odd, multiply it by three and add one (3N+1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   If the number is even, divide it by two (N/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The conjecture states that if you apply these rules repeatedly to any positive integer, the sequence will eventually end up in the "four, two, one loop" (4 → 2 → 1 → 4...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Once a number reaches one, applying the rule (1 x 3 + 1 = 4) brings it back to four, creating this perpetual loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

The numbers generated by applying these rules are called "hailstone numbers" because their values tend to go up and down like hailstones before eventually falling to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. The number of steps it takes for a sequence to reach one is called its "total stopping time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. For example, starting with 7: 7 → 22 → 11 → 34 → 17 → 52 → 26 → 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. While 26 takes 10 steps to reach one, 27, the very next number, can climb as high as 9,232 before taking 111 steps to reach one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The paths for different numbers vary widely, even for adjacent numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

## Infamy and Early Challenges

Among professional mathematicians, the 3x+1 problem is infamous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. It was jokingly thought to be something invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science due to the lack of progress on such a seemingly trivial problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Jeffrey Lagarias, considered the world authority on 3x+1, has even warned young mathematicians against working on it to establish a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

## Approaches to Analysis

### Statistical Insights

*   **Randomness and Brownian Motion**: Researchers like Alex Kontorovich and Yakov Sinai have observed that the paths of hailstone numbers, when graphed on a logarithmic scale, resemble a wiggly graph with a downward trend, similar to the stock market on a bad day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. This behavior is an example of geometric Brownian motion, where fluctuations are random if the linear trend is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. While the stock market tends to trend upwards over long periods, 3x+1 sequences tend to trend downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **[[Benfords Law and its application to the Collatz Conjecture | Benford's Law]]**: Another analytical method involves examining the leading digit of numbers within a sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. When a histogram is created for the leading digits across many sequences, a stable pattern emerges: approximately 30% of numbers start with one, 17.5% with two, and the frequency decreases for higher digits, following [[Benfords Law and its application to the Collatz Conjecture | Benford's law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. This law appears in various natural and artificial datasets, but it does not provide a definitive answer as to whether all numbers will end up in the 4,2,1 loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.
*   **Average Shrinkage Argument**: Counterintuitively, despite odd numbers being "more than tripled" and even numbers "only cut in half," sequences tend to shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. This is because every time an odd number is multiplied by three and one is added, the result is always an even number, which then *must* be divided by two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Therefore, odd numbers are effectively increased by a factor of about 3/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. By taking the geometric mean of growth factors from one odd number to the next, it's found that, on average, the number is multiplied by 3/4, which is less than one, statistically suggesting sequences are more likely to shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

### [[Visualization techniques for understanding the conjecture | Visualization Techniques]]

*   **Directed Graph**: One way to understand the paths of numbers is to show how each connects to the next in its sequence, forming a directed graph that resembles a tree or merging streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. If the conjecture is true, every number, even those from infinity, eventually flows into the "massive river of four, two, one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.
*   **Rotated Graph**: Mathematicians have modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number (anticlockwise for odd, clockwise for even) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. This creates intricate, organic shapes resembling coral or seaweed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

## Ways the Conjecture Could Be False

The [[collatz_conjecture_overview | Collatz Conjecture]] could be disproven in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>:
1.  **Divergent Sequence**: A number could exist that starts a sequence that grows to infinity, never falling back to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.
2.  **Another Closed Loop**: A sequence could form a closed loop of numbers other than the 4,2,1 loop, existing unconnected to the main graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

## Brute Force Verification

To date, no divergent sequence or alternative loop has been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. Mathematicians have tested every single number up to 2^68 (approximately 295 quintillion numbers) by brute force, confirming that all of them eventually come back down to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Based on this, it's calculated that any hypothetical loop other than 4,2,1 would have to be at least 186 billion numbers long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. While this provides strong evidence, it does not constitute a mathematical proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

## Partial Proofs and "Almost All" Numbers

One approach to proving the conjecture involves showing that every 3x+1 sequence eventually contains a number smaller than its original seed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. If this could be proven, it would mean that every sequence must eventually descend to one, thus entering the 4,2,1 loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

While a full proof of this has not been achieved:
*   In 1976, Riho Terras showed that "almost all" [[collatz_conjecture_overview | Collatz sequences]] reach a point below their initial value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>.
*   This limit was refined in 1979 and 1994, with almost all numbers going to less than X to the power of 0.869, then 0.7925 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:05]</a>.
*   In 2019, Terry Tao, one of the world's greatest living mathematicians, further demonstrated that "almost all" numbers will eventually become smaller than *any* arbitrarily slow-growing function of x (like log x or log log x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>. In 2020, Tao stated this was "about as close as one can get to the [[collatz_conjecture_overview | Collatz Conjecture]] without actually solving it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.

However, "almost all" in mathematics has a technical definition meaning that the fraction of numbers obeying the criteria goes to one as the numbers go to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. This doesn't rule out the possibility of an infinite number of exceptions. For instance, "almost all" numbers are not perfect squares, yet there are infinitely many perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>.

## Arguments for Seeking Counterexamples

Given the difficulty of proving the conjecture, some suggest that more effort should be spent trying to disprove it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. The current brute-force verification up to 2^68 is a vast number, but on the scale of all numbers, it's "nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>. The Polya conjecture, proposed in 1919, was disproven in 1958 by a counterexample at 1.845 x 10^361, a number vastly larger than anything checked for 3x+1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>.

The conjecture can be thought of as a simple program running on a Turing machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. While it's possible to calculate numbers that exhibit specific finite behaviors (e.g., climbing by 3/2 ten or a hundred times in a row), there's no control over the sequence after that specified finite section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>. It's virtually impossible to guess a counterexample, and the space of all possibilities is too large to search exhaustively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>.

Interestingly, if negative numbers are included, applying the same 3x+1 rules reveals not one loop, but three independent loops of numbers, including loops involving -17 and -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. This raises the question of why disconnected loops exist on the negative side but not, as far as we know, on the positive side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.

## The Possibility of Undecidability

There remains another option: the [[collatz_conjecture_overview | Collatz Conjecture]] may be undecidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>. In 1987, John Conway created a generalization of 3x+1 called FRACTRAN and showed it to be Turing-complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>. This means FRACTRAN can do anything a modern computer can, but it also implies it's subject to the halting problem—the possibility that the machine never stops running and thus never gives an output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. While this doesn't definitively prove 3x+1 is also subject to the halting problem, it suggests that proving the conjecture true or false may be impossible given our current knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>.

The problem highlights the profound complexity hidden within seemingly simple mathematical operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>. As Paul Erdos implied, perhaps mathematics is not yet "ripe enough" to fully grasp such peculiar behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>.

The process of discovering truth, particularly in science, is often misunderstood. It is not primarily about confirming what one believes, but rather about actively seeking to disprove theories and hypotheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This approach is fundamental to the [[verification_of_physical_theories | scientific method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## The Number Sequence Game

To illustrate this principle, an experiment was conducted where participants were given a sequence of three numbers: 2, 4, 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. They were tasked with discovering the underlying rule by proposing their own sets of three numbers, to which the facilitator would respond "yes" (it follows the rule) or "no" (it does not) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Initial Approach: Seeking Confirmation

Initially, participants tended to propose sequences that supported an early hypothesis, such as "multiply by 2" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Examples include:
*   16, 32, 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> (followed the rule)
*   3, 6, 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> (followed the rule)
*   10, 20, 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> (followed the rule)
*   5, 10, 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> (followed the rule)

While these sequences confirmed the participants' "multiply by 2" hypothesis, the facilitator repeatedly stated that this was *not* the actual rule, despite the proposed numbers fitting the hidden rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This highlights a common [[cognitive_bias_and_hypothesis_testing | cognitive bias]]: people tend to propose tests that confirm what they already believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Shifting Strategy: Seeking Disproof

The facilitator encouraged participants to "think strategically" and to seek "no's," as these responses provide more information than "yes" responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This shift in strategy, focusing on what *doesn't* fit, is crucial for [[discovering_truth_through_disproof | discovering truth]].

When participants began to propose sequences that challenged their existing beliefs, such as 2, 4, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> (which surprisingly *did* fit the rule), they moved closer to the actual rule. The turning point came when a sequence like 10, 9, 8 was proposed and *did not* follow the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

This "no" provided the critical insight: the rule was simply "numbers in increasing order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Any numbers in ascending order, such as 1, 2, 3 or 7, 8, 9, followed the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Inspiration from *The Black Swan*

This demonstration was inspired by Nassim Taleb's book, *The Black Swan* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The "black swan" serves as a metaphor for the unknown and unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Historically, the theory was that all swans were white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Every observation of a white swan seemingly reinforced this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. However, the crucial point is that one can never definitively *prove* a theory to be true through countless confirming examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The theory was ultimately disproven when [[discovering_truth_through_disproof | black swans]] were discovered in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## The Importance of Disproving Theories

The core lesson from both the number game and the black swan analogy is that the [[scientific_debate_and_public_discourse | scientific method]] is built on the principle of falsification. Scientists set out to *disprove* their theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. A theory is considered robust and potentially true when it *cannot* be disproven despite rigorous attempts to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

> "We set out to disprove our theories, and it's when we can't disprove them that we say this must be getting at something really true about our reality." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>

This approach is vital not only in science but also in everyday life: to genuinely ascertain the truth of a belief, one should try as hard as possible to disprove it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Only then can one get closer to the truth and avoid self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

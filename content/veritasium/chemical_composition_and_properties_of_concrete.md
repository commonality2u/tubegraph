Concrete is a fundamental man-made substance, used more than any other material on Earth except water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Its importance stems from its properties as a "liquid rock" â€“ it can be poured into any shape, is strong, durable, inexpensive, and easy to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Every year, approximately 500 kilograms of cement are created for every person globally, which can produce about two cubic meters of concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Cement vs. Concrete
It's important to understand the [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | difference between cement and concrete]].
*   **Cement** is the "glue," acting as the matrix of the substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Concrete** is cement mixed with aggregate, specifically gravel and sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Historical Development of Cement and Concrete
Humans have been making a version of concrete for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Primitive Cement Production
The key ingredient for primitive cement is limestone, which is primarily calcium carbonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
1.  **Heating**: Limestone is heated to around 1,000 degrees Celsius, driving off CO2 and leaving calcium oxide, also known as quicklime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
2.  **Mixing with Water**: Grinding the calcium oxide and mixing it with water produces an exothermic reaction, creating calcium hydroxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
3.  **Hardening**: This mixture can be poured into a mold. Over time, it absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere and turns back into calcium carbonate as the water evaporates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

**Drawbacks**: Primitive cement has limitations. Molds cannot be very large because CO2 cannot penetrate deeply enough to harden all the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. It also does not work underwater due to the absence of CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Roman Concrete Innovations
The Romans discovered a solution to these problems by adding volcanic ash, called pozzolana, to crushed limestone before heating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This resulted in a much stronger and more durable cement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. They utilized it to build structures like the Pantheon, the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world, which has stood for 2,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, and concrete piers that hardened underwater and are still standing today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The exceptional strength, durability, and ability of Roman cement to set underwater came from the pozzolana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This volcanic ash, along with clay or shale, contains silica, which fundamentally changes the chemistry of the cement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Silica enables the cement to harden without drying, as water becomes an integral part of the hardened concrete, allowing it to achieve maximum strength when setting underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Modern Portland Cement
The Roman recipe was lost for centuries until its rediscovery in a Swiss monastery in the 1400s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Today, virtually all concrete is made with a cement formulation discovered in the 1840s, known as Portland cement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The name is a marketing term, referencing the desirable gray rocks quarried near Portland, England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

**Production of Portland Cement**:
1.  Limestone is crushed and mixed with shale or clay (to provide silicates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
2.  This mixture is ground into a fine powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
3.  It is then heated to very high temperatures in a kiln, producing hard nodules called clinker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
4.  Though historically considered waste due to its hardness, grinding down clinker produces a cement far superior to other chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

The most common compound in Portland cement is tricalcium silicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Chemical Properties and Hardening Process (Hydration)
Concrete hardens through a process called **cement hydration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
1.  When water is added to the dry mixture of gravel, sand, and cement powder, it starts dissolving the cement powder grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
2.  Ions enter the solution, including calcium hydroxide, which makes concrete a very basic solution with a pH that can reach 12 or 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
3.  As tricalcium silicate (the most common compound in cement) reacts with water, crystals of calcium silicate hydrates and other hydrate minerals begin to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
4.  These crystals grow and interlock, causing the concrete to harden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
5.  Water is essential for this crystal formation; it doesn't evaporate but becomes part of the solid concrete material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Therefore, freshly poured concrete should be kept in a damp environment to ensure proper curing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

## Physical Properties of Concrete

### Density and Buoyancy
Concrete is about three times as dense as water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This high density means that objects can be very buoyant in concrete, with people potentially floating up to their waist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Strength and Durability
Concrete gains strength over time, with samples typically tested at 7, 14, and 28 days to ensure they meet required strength specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Concrete can continue strengthening even after 28 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

*   **Compression Testing**: Concrete strength is measured by placing cylindrical samples in a hydraulic press and increasing pressure until they fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Typical concrete can achieve strengths well over 10,000 pounds per square inch (psi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, with the strongest concrete in lab competitions exceeding 100,000 psi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Role of Aggregate**: While pure cement has the most "glue," adding aggregates (sand and gravel) does not significantly reduce the ultimate compressive strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. In fact, aggregate helps the concrete sample cohere and stay together under load, as pure cement tends to flake and chip more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Since cement is the most expensive component, reducing its proportion (typically to 30% of the mix) while maintaining strength is cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Consistency and Additives
The consistency of concrete is crucial for its workability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. While water can adjust consistency, it can also affect strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Modern concrete often uses chemical admixtures like **superplasticizers** to make it easier to work and spread without significantly altering water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

**Slump Test**: A slump test (or spread test) is performed to check consistency. A cone filled with concrete is lifted, and the distance the concrete spreads is measured to ensure it meets specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

### Setting Time
Concrete typically takes about four hours to harden without agitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. This is why concrete mixer trucks continuously rotate their drums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. If concrete begins to set in a truck, adding sugary soft drinks like Coke can prevent the setting process for a few hours, as the sugars interfere with hydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_roman_and_modern_concrete | Comparison of Roman and Modern Concrete]]
While Roman concrete had surprising advantages, it is not superior to modern concrete in short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Self-Healing**: Roman concrete was less well-mixed, leaving undissolved calcium oxide blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. When cracks formed and water entered, it would dissolve the calcium oxide, forming calcium hydroxide, leading to new growth of calcium carbonate and effectively "self-healing" the concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Survivor Bias**: The structures that survive from the Roman era represent a survivor bias, meaning only the most durable examples are observed today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Modern societies choose not to produce extremely long-lasting concretes because it is less expensive, and buildings are not expected to last for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

## Origin and [[environmental_impact_of_cement_and_concrete | Environmental Impact]]
The core component of cement and concrete, limestone, originates from the skeletons and shells of ancient sea organisms that died millions of years ago and were then compressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

Despite its utility, concrete production, particularly cement manufacturing, contributes significantly to global CO2 emissions, estimated at 8% of the total, surpassing the entire aviation sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.

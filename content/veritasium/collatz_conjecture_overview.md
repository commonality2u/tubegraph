The Collatz Conjecture is widely considered one of the most dangerous problems in mathematics, with young mathematicians often warned against wasting their time on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite its simple premise, not even the world's best mathematicians have been able to solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The famous mathematician Paul Erdos famously stated, "Mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## How the Collatz Conjecture Works

The conjecture operates using two simple rules applied to any positive integer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>:
*   **If the number is odd**: Multiply it by three and add one ($3n+1$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **If the number is even**: Divide it by two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

These rules are applied repeatedly to the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. For example, starting with seven:
7 (odd) $\rightarrow 3 \times 7 + 1 = 22$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
22 (even) $\rightarrow 22 \div 2 = 11$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
11 (odd) $\rightarrow 3 \times 11 + 1 = 34$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
...and so on, until the sequence reaches 16 $\rightarrow$ 8 $\rightarrow$ 4 $\rightarrow$ 2 $\rightarrow$ 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Once one is reached, applying the rules leads to $1 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1$, forming a permanent loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

The conjecture states that every positive integer, when these rules are applied, will eventually end up in the four, two, one loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Names and Origin
The conjecture is commonly known as the Collatz Conjecture, named after German mathematician Luther Collatz, who may have conceived it in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. However, it has many origin stories and names, including the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply $3N+1$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Properties of Collatz Sequences

The numbers generated by applying the $3x+1$ rules are known as **hailstone numbers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This name comes from their tendency to rise and fall, like hailstones in a thundercloud, before eventually falling down to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

For any given number, the "total stopping time" is the number of steps it takes to reach one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. For example, starting with 26, it takes 10 steps to reach one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. However, sequences can vary wildly; starting with 27, the numbers climb as high as 9,232 (higher than Mount Everest if thought of as altitude) before falling back to one, taking 111 steps in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The paths of different numbers, even those next to each other, can vary widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Infamy and Difficulty
Among professional mathematicians, the $3x+1$ problem is considered infamous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Jeffrey Lagarias, considered the world authority on $3x+1$, advises young mathematicians against working on it if they want to establish a career, suggesting they "do real math for a while" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Some even jokingly suggested it was a Soviet invention to slow down U.S. science due to its trivial appearance but intractable nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Brute Force Testing
Mathematicians have extensively tested numbers by brute force. Every single number up to $2^{68}$ (which is 295,147,905,179,352,825,856 numbers) has been confirmed to eventually come back down to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This massive amount of empirical evidence strongly suggests the conjecture is true, but it does not constitute a proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. If another loop exists besides four, two, one, it must be at least 186 billion numbers long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Statistical Analysis
While it might seem that sequences should grow (odd numbers are tripled, even are halved), the key insight is that an odd number multiplied by three and then adding one ($3n+1$) *always* results in an even number, which is then immediately divided by two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This means odd numbers are effectively increased by a factor of about $3/2$ before the next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

Considering the path from one odd number to the next odd number:
*   50% of the time, the next odd number is $3/2$ of the current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   25% of the time, it's $3/4$ (dividing by four) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   12.5% of the time, it's $3/8$ (dividing by eight), and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
Taking the geometric mean of these factors, the average change from one odd number to the next is $3/4$, which is less than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Statistically, $3x+1$ sequences are more likely to shrink than grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

#### [[Benfords Law and its application to the Collatz Conjecture | Benford's Law]]
Analyzing the leading digit of numbers in Collatz sequences reveals a fascinating pattern that follows [[Benfords Law and its application to the Collatz Conjecture | Benford's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. For the first billion sequences, approximately 30% of all numbers start with one, decreasing to less than 5% for numbers starting with nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This distribution appears in various natural phenomena and even helps detect fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. While interesting, [[Benfords Law and its application to the Collatz Conjecture | Benford's Law]] cannot prove whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

#### Brownian Motion Analogy
When plotted on a logarithmic scale, the sequence of a large random number peaks and then drops, resembling a wiggly graph with a downward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This behavior is similar to geometric Brownian motion, like the stock market on a bad day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The fluctuations are random, like flipping a coin at each step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. While the stock market tends to trend upwards over long periods, $3x+1$ sequences tend to trend downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Progress on "Almost All Numbers"
A significant line of attack involves showing that every $3x+1$ sequence must eventually reach a number smaller than its initial seed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. If proven, this would imply all sequences eventually reach one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

*   In 1976, Riho Terras showed that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   In 1979, this limit was reduced to almost all numbers going to less than $X^{0.869}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   In 1994, it was further lowered to less than $X^{0.7925}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   In 2019, Terry Tao, one of the world's greatest living mathematicians, proved that almost all numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function $f(x)$ as long as that function goes to infinity as $x$ goes to infinity (e.g., $\log x$, $\log\log\log x$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. This means for almost all numbers, an arbitrarily small number is guaranteed somewhere in its sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Tao stated that this is "about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture without actually solving it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

However, "almost all numbers" has a technical mathematical definition (the fraction of numbers satisfying the criteria goes to one as the numbers go to infinity), which does not equate to "all numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. Just as almost all numbers are not perfect squares (though there are infinitely many perfect squares) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, this doesn't rule out a counterexample.

### Potential Counterexamples
There are two ways the conjecture could be false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>:
1.  **Divergent sequence**: A number might start a sequence that grows to infinity, never falling back to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
2.  **Undetected loop**: There could exist a closed loop of numbers other than the four, two, one loop, disconnected from the main graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

Thus far, no such loop or sequence shooting off to infinity has been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Some mathematicians advocate for spending more energy looking for counterexamples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, as it's very difficult to prove a theorem that is false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. The counterexample to the Polya conjecture (proposed in 1919 and disproven in 1958) was $1.845 \times 10^{361}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, which is vastly larger than numbers checked for $3x+1$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. This suggests that a counterexample, if one exists, could be astronomically large and beyond brute-force discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

### Behavior with Negative Numbers
If the same $3x+1$ rules are applied to negative numbers, the behavior changes drastically. Instead of a single loop, there are three independent loops of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>:
*   The $(-1) \rightarrow (-2) \rightarrow (-1)$ loop.
*   The $(-5) \rightarrow (-14) \rightarrow (-7) \rightarrow (-20) \rightarrow (-10) \rightarrow (-5)$ loop.
*   The $(-17) \rightarrow (-50) \rightarrow (-25) \rightarrow (-74) \rightarrow (-37) \rightarrow (-110) \rightarrow (-55) \rightarrow (-164) \rightarrow (-82) \rightarrow (-41) \rightarrow (-122) \rightarrow (-61) \rightarrow (-182) \rightarrow (-91) \rightarrow (-272) \rightarrow (-136) \rightarrow (-68) \rightarrow (-34) \rightarrow (-17)$ loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
The existence of disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line raises questions about why they wouldn't exist on the positive side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

## [[Visualization techniques for understanding the conjecture | Visualization Techniques]]
One way to understand Collatz sequences is through [[Visualization techniques for understanding the conjecture | directed graphs]], showing how each number connects to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This creates a tree-like structure, with the conjecture implying that every number eventually flows into the "massive river" of four, two, one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

Modified visualizations rotate the graph at each number (anticlockwise for odd, clockwise for even). Adjusting the rotation degree creates intricate, organic shapes resembling coral or seaweed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Undecidability
Another possibility is that the Collatz Conjecture is undecidable, meaning it can never be proven true or false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. In 1987, John Conway created a generalization of $3x+1$ called FRACTRAN, a Turing-complete mathematical machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. As FRACTRAN is subject to the halting problem (a machine may never stop running), it's possible that $3x+1$ could also be undecidable, preventing a definitive proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

The Collatz Conjecture highlights the peculiar and complex nature of numbers, demonstrating how a simple operation can lead to intricate, intractable patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

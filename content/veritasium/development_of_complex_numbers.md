Mathematics initially served as a tool to quantify the world, assisting in land measurement, planetary motion prediction, and commerce tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, a significant challenge arose with the cubic equation, prompting a shift away from strictly real-world applications and leading to the invention of new numbers called imaginary numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These numbers, initially considered fanciful, later proved central to fundamental physical theories of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Impossible Cubic Equation

In 1494, Luca Pacioli, who was Leonardo da Vinci's math teacher, published "Summa de Arithmetica," a comprehensive summary of mathematics known in Renaissance Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This work included a section on the cubic equation, typically written as ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For at least 4,000 years, civilizations like the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, and Persians attempted to find a general solution to the cubic, but all were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Pacioli concluded that a solution to the cubic equation was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

This conclusion was surprising, given that quadratic equations (without the x³ term) had been solved thousands of years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The general solution for quadratics (x = -b ±√(b² - 4ac) / 2a) is widely known today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Geometry and the Limitation of Early Mathematics

Ancient mathematicians approached problems through geometry, using words and pictures instead of modern equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. For example, x² + 26x = 27 would be visualized as a square of side 'x' and a rectangle of dimensions 26 by 'x' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The method of "completing the square" involved manipulating these areas to form a larger square, allowing for the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

However, this geometric approach had limitations. It only yielded positive solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. For example, while x=1 is a solution to x² + 26x = 27, x=-27 is also a valid algebraic solution but made no sense geometrically (e.g., a square with negative side length) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Consequently, for thousands of years, mathematicians were unaware of negative solutions and actively avoided negative numbers, leading to multiple versions of quadratic equations to ensure positive coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Similarly, the Persian mathematician Omar Khayyam in the 11th century identified 19 different cubic equations, always keeping coefficients positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. He found numerical solutions for some by examining intersections of shapes like hyperbolas and circles, but a general solution eluded him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## The Secret Solution to the Cubic

The breakthrough for [[cubic_equation_solutions | cubic equation solutions]] began in the 16th century. Around 1510, Scipione del Ferro, a mathematics professor at the University of Bologna, found a reliable method to solve "depressed cubics"—cubic equations without an x² term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. To protect his job in an era of mathematical duels, del Ferro kept his discovery secret, only revealing it on his deathbed in 1526 to his student, Antonio Fior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

Fior, less talented than his mentor, boasted about his ability to solve depressed cubics, leading him to challenge Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia in 1535 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Tartaglia, a largely self-taught mathematician with a speech impediment (earning him the nickname "Stutterer"), learned of Fior's claims and independently set about solving the depressed cubic himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. In the math duel, Fior failed to solve any problems, while Tartaglia solved all 30 of Fior's depressed cubics in just two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

Tartaglia's method extended the idea of completing the square into three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. For an equation like x³ + 9x = 26, he imagined extending a cube of volume x³ with additional rectangular prisms to form a larger cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This process transformed the cubic into a quadratic equation in terms of a new variable, which could then be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Tartaglia summarized his algorithm not as equations, but as a poem, as modern algebraic notation wouldn't exist for another century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### Cardano and the Full Cubic Solution

Tartaglia's victory made him a celebrity, attracting the attention of Gerolamo Cardano, a polymath from Milan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. After much persistence and a solemn oath from Cardano not to publish the method, Tartaglia revealed his secret in 1539 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Cardano, driven to find a solution for the *full* cubic equation (including the x² term), discovered a substitution (x - b/3a) that could transform any general cubic into a depressed cubic, which could then be solved by Tartaglia's formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Eager to publish this monumental achievement, Cardano felt bound by his oath to Tartaglia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

In 1542, while visiting Bologna, Cardano discovered del Ferro's original solution for the depressed cubic in his son-in-law's notebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Since del Ferro's work predated Tartaglia's, Cardano felt justified in publishing the complete solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Three years later, he released "Ars Magna" (The Great Art), which pushed geometric reasoning to its limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Although Cardano acknowledged Tartaglia, del Ferro, and Fior, Tartaglia was infuriated, leading to a public feud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. To this day, the general solution to the cubic is often called Cardano's method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## The Emergence of Imaginary Numbers

While writing "Ars Magna," Cardano encountered cubic equations like x³ = 15x + 4, where plugging values into the algorithm resulted in solutions containing the square roots of negative numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Cardano initially dismissed these as "useless," and the geometric derivation led to a paradox involving "negative area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

Historically, square roots of negatives appeared when there was no real solution to a problem, for instance, finding two numbers that add to 10 and multiply to 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. However, for the cubic x³ = 15x + 4, a real solution (x=4) clearly existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

Around 10 years later, Italian engineer Rafael Bombelli tackled this conundrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Undeterred by the "impossible geometry," Bombelli dared to treat the square root of a negative as a new type of number, "neither positive nor negative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. He assumed that the terms in Cardano's solution involving these square roots could be represented as a combination of ordinary and this new type of number involving √-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. By doing so, Bombelli found that the two cube roots in Cardano's equation (which contained √-1) summed up to the correct real answer (four) because the imaginary parts cancelled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This was a miraculous discovery: Cardano's method worked, but only by abandoning geometric proofs and allowing "negative areas" as an intermediate step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

### Formalization and Application

The 17th century saw the rapid [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | development of modern mathematics]]. Francois Viete introduced modern symbolic notation for algebra, moving away from wordy descriptions and drawings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Rene Descartes popularized the square roots of negatives, giving them the lasting name "imaginary numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Later, Euler introduced the symbol 'i' to represent √-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. When combined with real numbers, they form complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

The cubic equation directly led to the invention of these new numbers, liberating algebra from its strict reliance on geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. By embracing mathematical concepts that didn't immediately align with physical reality, a more powerful and complete mathematics emerged, capable of solving real problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

### [[application_of_imaginary_numbers_in_physics | Application of Imaginary Numbers in Physics]]

The impact of imaginary numbers extended far beyond algebra. In 1925, Erwin Schrödinger was developing a wave equation to describe the behavior of quantum particles, building on Louis de Broglie's idea that matter consists of waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. The resulting Schrödinger equation, one of physics' most fundamental equations, prominently features 'i' (the square root of negative one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

Physicists were initially uncomfortable with the appearance of an imaginary number in a fundamental theory, with Schrödinger himself expressing his objection to the "unpleasant" use of complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

However, imaginary numbers possess unique properties crucial for describing waves. They exist on a dimension perpendicular to the real number line, forming the complex plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. Multiplying by 'i' corresponds to a 90-degree rotation in this plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. The function e^ix, known from [[Euler's formula]], creates a spiral in the complex plane; its real part is a cosine wave, and its imaginary part is a sine wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. These two quintessential wave functions are contained within e^ix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

Schrödinger naturally assumed his equation's solutions would resemble e^(ikx - ωt) due to its useful properties, such as its derivative being proportional to the original function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. This form also allows for the superposition of multiple solutions, creating any wave shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. As physicist Freeman Dyson noted, "Schrödinger put the square root of minus one into the equation, and suddenly it made sense. Suddenly it became a wave equation instead of a heat conduction equation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. The Schrödinger equation accurately describes atomic behavior and forms the basis of chemistry and most of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. This discovery confirmed that nature operates with complex numbers, not just real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

The journey from the "impossible" cubic to the fundamental equations of [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]] illustrates that by letting go of an immediate connection between mathematics and tangible reality, a deeper understanding of the universe's true nature can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.

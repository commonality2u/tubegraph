While [[turbulent_flow_vs_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] is often described as "pretty" and "well-behaved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, turbulent flow is omnipresent in nature and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, playing essential roles despite its complex and often unpredictable nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Turbulent flow is characterized by chaotic motion, consisting of many interacting swirls of fluid called eddies or vortices, and being diffusive and dissipative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Natural Phenomena and Applications

Turbulent flow is not the exception, but the rule in the natural world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

*   **Atmospheric and Cosmic Scales**:
    *   Air motion in a room is generally turbulent, consisting of eddies ranging from micrometers to meters in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
    *   The surface of the Sun is turbulent, with hot plasma rising in convection currents, forming cell-like structures roughly the size of Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
    *   Jupiter's surface is covered in eddies of various sizes, including the Great Red Spot, a vortex larger than Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    *   Dust between stars moves turbulently, causing radio sources to twinkle, similar to how atmospheric turbulence makes stars twinkle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The Orion Nebula, twenty-four light-years across, is a stunning example of this turbulent dust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Earthly Examples**:
    *   The air flowing in and out of human lungs is turbulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
    *   Blood pumping through the aorta is turbulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
    *   The atmosphere near the Earth's surface is turbulent, as is the airflow in and around cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   Modeling shows that turbulent flow plays an essential role in the formation of raindrops; thus, turbulence literally makes it rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   Fish can take advantage of turbulent water, for example, by utilizing the wake of objects to swim more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## Technological Applications and Considerations

Many [[applications_in_aerospace_and_space_technology | technological applications]] grapple with or strategically utilize turbulent flow.

*   **Fluid-Object Interaction and Drag**:
    *   When fluid flows over a surface, a boundary layer forms where fluid velocity adjusts from zero at the surface to the free stream velocity further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
    *   If the fluid velocity is fast or the surface is long, this boundary layer can transition to turbulence, leading to a turbulent boundary layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
    *   In a turbulent boundary layer, fluid swirls and mixes, bringing faster-flowing fluid closer to the surface, which significantly increases skin friction drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
    *   Boundary layers around planes and large ships are mostly turbulent, and skin friction accounts for the majority of the drag they experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
    *   Small obstacles or rough surfaces can "trip" laminar boundary layers into becoming turbulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Therefore, clean, smooth surfaces can reduce drag and save fuel costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This is why dirty cars get worse gas mileage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> and planes are frequently washed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Aircraft and Lift**:
    *   Despite the desire for smooth surfaces to reduce drag, engineers sometimes intentionally induce turbulence on aircraft wings using small fins called vortex generators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
    *   At low speeds or high angles of attack, airflow can separate from the wing, leading to a condition known as stall, which dramatically decreases lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
    *   Vortex generators create turbulence that mixes faster-flowing air from higher up closer to the wing's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This "energizes" the fluid flow, allowing it to follow the wing's surface for longer, maintaining attached airflow and lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This allows planes to fly efficiently, effectively, and climb at higher angles of attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Golf Balls and Distance**:
    *   Early smooth golf balls did not fly as far as dimpled ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
    *   A smooth ball creates a laminar boundary layer with low skin friction, but the airflow separates easily, leaving a large wake of low-pressure turbulent air behind the ball, which causes significant pressure drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
    *   Dimples on a golf ball force the boundary layer to become turbulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. A turbulent boundary layer can cling to the ball's surface for longer before separating, reducing the size of the turbulent wake and thus reducing pressure drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This reduction in pressure drag outweighs the increase in skin friction drag, allowing the golf ball to travel further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The drag coefficient can drop by almost a factor of two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Harnessing Turbulent Wakes**:
    *   Scientists are researching ways to harness the energy contained within turbulent wakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
    *   A phenomenon called periodic vortex shedding, where vortices alternate from one side of an object (like a cylinder or an island) forming a pattern known as a von Karman Vortex Street, is part of the transition to turbulence and can be observed from space via cloud patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Researchers are exploring methods to extract energy from these vortex structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Rocket Nozzles**:
    *   Turbulent flow is actively studied for [[applications_in_aerospace_and_space_technology | applications in rocket nozzles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

In contrast, [[turbulent_flow_vs_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] is primarily notable for decorative uses, such as in fountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Turbulent flow, though messy, is a fundamental aspect of the universe, offering deep and rich insights and utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

Mosquitoes are notorious for their bites, but only female mosquitoes bite humans and other vertebrates. This is because female mosquitoes require blood proteins to produce their eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Lifecycle Stages

The lifecycle of a mosquito is relatively quick, taking just two weeks from egg to adult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The stages are as follows:

1.  **Eggs**: Female mosquitoes lay eggs after obtaining a blood meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
2.  **Larvae**: The eggs hatch into wriggly larvae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
3.  **Pupae**: Larvae then develop into pupae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
4.  **Adults**: Pupae transform into flying, adult mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Once adults, they again seek out vertebrate blood to produce more eggs, continuing the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

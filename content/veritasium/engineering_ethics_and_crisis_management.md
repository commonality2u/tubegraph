The 1978 crisis involving the Citicorp Center in Manhattan serves as a significant case study in [[impact_of_citicorp_repairs_on_engineering_standards | engineering ethics]] and crisis management. The structural engineer, Bill LeMessurier, faced a profound ethical dilemma when he discovered a fatal flaw in his cutting-edge skyscraper, which had been open for less than a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The Discovery of a Fatal Flaw

Citicorp Center, an engineering marvel, was found to have a critical vulnerability: winds of just 110 kilometers per hour could cause it to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, potentially killing thousands in the surrounding area, with hurricane season only weeks away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. LeMessurier realized the building had a "100% probability of total collapse by the end of the century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Design and Oversight
The unique design of the Citicorp Center was driven by a requirement from St. Peter's Church, which occupied part of the city block where the tower was to be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The church insisted on being physically distinct and independent, requiring two-thirds of the space above it to be open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This led LeMessurier to propose building the skyscraper on stilts, not at the corners, but at the center of each face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

To manage gravity and wind loads, LeMessurier designed a unique system of diagonal chevron braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. These chevrons transferred forces to the middle of each face and down to the stilts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. To address the building's sway, which made it uncomfortable for occupants due to its lighter construction, LeMessurier incorporated a tuned mass damper (TMD)—a first for a building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This 400-ton concrete mass on the top floor would oscillate out of phase to the building's motion, significantly damping its sway and reducing amplitude by roughly 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### The Source of the Error
The crisis began when LeMessurier learned that the chevron braces were bolted, not welded, as per the original design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This change was made by a contractor to save a quarter of a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Initially, LeMessurier believed this substitution was fine, as the gravity load primarily compressed the braces, and tension only occurred under very high winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

However, a phone call from a student inquiring about the building's design prompted LeMessurier to re-examine the calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. He then considered "quartering winds"—winds hitting the building at a corner rather than straight on a face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This revealed that the forces on some braces could be 40% higher than calculated for perpendicular winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

Further analysis at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel showed that under dynamic conditions (when the building was moving), stresses could increase by up to 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Crucially, his firm had also failed to use the correct factor of safety, underestimating the gravity load and thus the required number of bolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Some joints, particularly on the 30th floor, needed 14 bolts but only had four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. If these weakest joints failed, the entire building would collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

LeMessurier found that a storm strong enough to cause collapse (110 km/h winds for five minutes) had a 1 in 16 chance of occurring in any given year, especially if power was knocked out and the TMD failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Hurricane Belle, with 110 km/h gusts, had passed through New York City just one year before Citicorp was completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

## Ethical Dilemma and Crisis Management

LeMessurier faced a "stark choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>: stay silent and hope, or act and risk professional ruin and mass panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Contemplating suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>, he ultimately decided that with thousands of lives at risk, there was "never any other choice but to act" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. This embodies a core principle of engineering ethics: a responsibility beyond oneself, especially when social risks are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.

### Project Serene: The Repair Operation
LeMessurier informed Citicorp's chairman, Walter Wriston, and they initiated a confidential repair plan, originally dubbed "Project Pandora" but later renamed "Project Serene" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. This extensive crisis management effort involved:
*   **Emergency Power for TMD**: Immediate acquisition of generators to ensure the tuned mass damper, now the building's "crutch," remained operational during a storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.
*   **Covert Repairs**: Each night, welders entered the building to remove sheetrock, weld two 5-centimeter thick steel plates on each problematic joint, and then restore the walls before morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. Over 200 joints needed reinforcement, starting with the most critical ones on the 30th floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
*   **Evacuation Plan**: Working with the Red Cross, a 10-block radius evacuation plan was developed, as a collapse could have catastrophic domino effects on surrounding buildings and thousands of residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.
*   **Monitoring**: Strain gauges were fitted on structural members to monitor the skyscraper's movements from a command center eight blocks away, providing crucial early warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.
*   **Executive Action**: When the phone company couldn't quickly install new telephone lines for the monitoring system, Citicorp's chairman called AT&T's president directly, and the lines were installed the next morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

### Managing Public Perception
Despite the risks, the decision was made not to inform the public or the building's occupants to prevent mass panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. When newspapers started asking questions, Citicorp released a vague statement, and a fortuitous newspaper strike in New York provided a "press blackout" until October, allowing repairs to proceed smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

### The Hurricane Scare
In late August, Hurricane Ella began brewing, threatening New York with winds reaching 200 km/h <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. City officials prepared for evacuation, and LeMessurier described the tension as "sweating blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. Fortunately, Ella veered off into the sea at the last minute, sparing New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

Repairs were completed in October, just six weeks after LeMessurier informed Citicorp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>, costing between $4 and $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. The building could now withstand a one-in-1000-year storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

For almost two decades, the secret remained within a small inner circle. However, in 1995, "The New Yorker" finally revealed Project Serene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. Far from being vilified, LeMessurier was [[career_impact_and_fulfilling_careers | praised for owning up to his mistake]] and swiftly fixing the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.

The incident had significant impacts:
*   **Building Code Updates**: New York updated its building code to require quartering wind calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.
*   **Tuned Mass Damper Adoption**: TMDs, first used in a building in Citicorp, became widespread globally, enabling taller and slimmer skyscrapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. Six of the world's 20 tallest buildings now use TMDs, especially in typhoon or earthquake-prone regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.
*   **[[science_communication_and_education | Engineering Ethics Education]]**: The Citicorp case is taught worldwide as a model of good [[impact_of_citicorp_repairs_on_engineering_standards | engineering ethics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. It highlights the immense responsibility engineers bear for public safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.

While the exact identity of the "mysterious student" who prompted LeMessurier's re-evaluation remains debated (Diane Hartley of Princeton and Lee DeCarolis of NJIT have been cited) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>, the crisis solidified LeMessurier's legacy as a paragon of integrity in the engineering field.

[[anechoic_chambers_and_their_effects_on_the_human_mind | Anechoic chambers]] are designed to be the quietest places on Earth, with one notable example being in Minneapolis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Another such chamber exists at BYU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The term "anechoic" comes from Latin, meaning "no echo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This environment is achieved through the strategic placement of foam wedges on the walls and a spring floor, which absorb sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Low-frequency sounds are bounced and eventually lost within the wall, while high frequencies are absorbed directly into the foam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The deadening effect on echoes is evident when clapping inside the chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Reported Effects and Myths

There are reports suggesting it is impossible to remain sane in an anechoic chamber for a significant period, with the record reportedly being 45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Alleged effects include:
*   **Claustrophobia** Individuals often feel claustrophobic or experience pressure on their head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, describing the feeling as being in a tiny room or even a coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This is theorized to be due to the absence of reverb, which normally provides the ear with a sense of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Anxiety and Panic** The sudden absence of familiar sounds can trigger an anxiety response, leading to panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This anxiety can escalate into stress, potentially leading to mental distress or even auditory hallucinations as the brain attempts to compensate for the missing stimuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Physical Disorientation** Visitors may experience dizziness, disoriention, and nausea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. There are claims that it becomes impossible to stand upright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Auditory Hallucinations** Some people reportedly hear oral hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

An anecdote tells of a violinist who reportedly banged on the door within seconds of being placed in such a room, trying to get out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## [[physical_sensations_and_perceptions_in_silence | Physical sensations and perceptions in silence]]

In extreme silence, the body's internal sounds become amplified:
*   **Clothing and Fluids** Even minor movements like the rustle of clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, or the movement of fluids in the mouth and throat become distinctly audible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Circulatory Sounds** Over time, individuals may hear the blood flow through their brain, described as a ringing or pulsing sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Some also report hearing their heartbeat from their chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Heightened Internal Awareness** The speaker in the video noted an increased awareness of their heart, feeling each pulse radiating up their chest towards their head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. They also felt their body slightly shake with each heartbeat, akin to a vibrating device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. A low-pitched hum and a hiss (attributed to hearing loss) were also perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Amplified Sounds** The brain seems to recalibrate, causing even the quietest sounds, such as a burp, to seem amplified and much louder than usual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. True silence requires conscious effort to achieve due to these internal noises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Personal Experience and [[debunking_myths_about_silence_driving_people_crazy | Debunking Myths About Silence Driving People Crazy]]

The speaker personally underwent a test, staying in an anechoic chamber with the lights off for nearly an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. They found the experience to be comfortable and relaxing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. They did not experience any dizziness, nausea, disorientation, or hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The speaker concluded that the myth of being unable to stay sane for more than 45 minutes in such a room is "busted," believing they could easily stay for five hours and accomplish work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

However, the speaker acknowledged that individuals who are uncomfortable in pitch-black rooms or small confined spaces might find the anechoic chamber unnerving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

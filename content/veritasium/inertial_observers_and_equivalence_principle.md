According to [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | the general theory of relativity]], gravity is not a force and gravitational fields are an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This concept is proven by understanding the nature of inertial observers and the [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | equivalence principle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Einstein's Happiest Thought

[[einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Albert Einstein]] considered imagining a man falling off a roof as "the happiest thought of his life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This happiness stemmed from the realization that a falling man would not feel his own weight; he would be weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Any objects he dropped would remain stationary relative to him or move in uniform motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This situation is identical to being in deep space, far from large masses, with a spaceship at rest or coasting at constant velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## The Inertial Observer

In deep space, away from large masses and gravitational fields, an observer feels no weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Objects remain stationary or move in a straight line at constant velocity if pushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This describes an inertial observer: someone who is not accelerating and is not in a gravitational field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. All laws of physics apply in their reference frame, meaning no experiment could distinguish their inertial reference frame from any other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Einstein's Equivalence Principle

Einstein's fundamental insight was that the scenario of the falling man and the deep-space observer are not just similar, but **physically equivalent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This implies that the man falling from the roof is not in a gravitational field, is not accelerating, and is an inertial observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

While it might seem counter-intuitive that the falling man is not accelerating (as his speed increases by 9.8 m/s every second near Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>), the [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | equivalence principle]] focuses on the experience of the observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. If an observer feels weightless, they are in an inertial frame of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

For instance, if a "Rocket Man" coasting through deep space approaches a planet, an external observer would see his path curve towards the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. However, Rocket Man inside would remain oblivious, feeling no force or acceleration, even as his speed increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. His frame of reference remains inertial until the moment he crashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Curved Spacetime

The curved path of Rocket Man's journey, without gravitational forces, is explained by **curved spacetime** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. While Rocket Man perceives himself moving in a straight line, he is actually moving in a straight line through spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Spacetime around massive objects, like planets, is curved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, causing his path to appear curved to a distant observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

*   **Geodesics**: Just as airplanes fly the shortest route (a straight line) on Earth's curved surface, which appears as a curved path on a flat map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, inertial observers follow "straight line paths" called geodesics through curved spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Analogy of the Equator**: Two people starting 1000 kilometers apart on the equator and heading due North will eventually meet at the North Pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This convergence, which feels like a force pushing them together, is simply a consequence of following straight paths (geodesics) on a curved surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Gravity is analogous to this apparent force; it doesn't actually exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Astronauts in Orbit**: Astronauts on the space station are weightless and are thus inertial observers traveling on a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The Earth's curvature of spacetime causes their straight-line path to appear as a helix, or a circular orbit if the time dimension is ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### The Bent Sheet Analogy

While common, the "bent sheet" analogy for curved spacetime can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. It might lead to the incorrect intuition that objects fall due to a gravitational force towards the well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. In [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | general relativity]], there is no gravitational force; objects travel on straight-line paths through spacetime, which appears curved due to the presence of massive objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

The core principle is: "Matter tells spacetime how to curve, and spacetime tells matter how to move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Acceleration and Our Own Reference Frame

Consider a rocket in deep space that accelerates upwards at 9.8 m/s² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Inside, objects would appear to fall towards the floor, and an observer would feel a force pushing up on their feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This situation feels exactly the same as being at rest on Earth's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

Because we do not feel weightless, we are not inertial observers when standing on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Our situation is identical to someone accelerating on a rocket ship in deep space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. In [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | general relativity]], this means we *are* accelerating, and there is no gravitational field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Gravitational fields do not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

In traditional [[newtons_second_law_and_variational_principles | Newtonian physics]], weight is a downward gravitational force, balanced by an upward normal force from the floor, resulting in no net force and no acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. However, in [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | general relativity]], gravity is not a force, and there is no weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The only force is the normal force pushing us up, meaning we are accelerating upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. An inertial observer, like the falling man, would see us accelerating up at 9.8 m/s² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

Acceleration, in [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | general relativity]], is defined as a deviation from a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. When standing still, the floor applies an upward force, preventing us from following a straight line path through spacetime, thus causing us to accelerate up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Even if spatial coordinates are not changing, it is possible to be accelerating in curved spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. One of the [[general_relativity_equations | general relativity equations]] shows that acceleration can be zero if the "curvature term" times the velocity through time squared equals zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. In curved spacetime, one needs to accelerate just to stand still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Why All Objects Fall at the Same Rate

[[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | General relativity]] simplifies the classical mystery of why all objects fall at the same rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. In [[newtons_second_law_and_variational_principles | Newtonian physics]], the equation F=ma (gravitational force = mass times acceleration) shows that the "gravitational mass" (m on the left, which experiences gravity) cancels out the "inertial mass" (m on the right, resistance to acceleration), leading to the same acceleration for all objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The mystery was why these two conceptually different masses are numerically identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

In [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | general relativity]], there is no mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. All objects *appear* to fall the same way because they are not accelerating; they are simply following straight-line paths through spacetime until something stops them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Just like objects in the accelerating rocket ship appear to fall at the same rate because the floor is accelerating into them, not because they are truly accelerating themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

## Experimental Verification

When [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | Einstein proposed general relativity]] in 1915, he suggested measurable predictions to test his theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

*   **Light Bending in Accelerating Frames**: In an accelerating rocket, an external observer sees light travel in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. However, inside the rocket, as the light travels across the cabin, the rocket speeds up, causing the light to hit the opposite wall slightly lower than its source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This demonstrates that light deflects downwards in an accelerating frame of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Light Bending by Mass**: By extension, [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | Einstein]] reasoned that light must also bend when it passes a large mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The ideal experiment involved observing light from distant stars passing near the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This was only possible during a total solar eclipse, which occurred in 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Arthur Eddington's expedition photographed stars near the Sun, and his analysis confirmed that their positions were deflected by the precise amount predicted by [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | Einstein's general theory of relativity]], which was twice the deflection calculated by a strictly [[newtons_second_law_and_variational_principles | Newtonian model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

[[experiments_and_predictions_related_to_general_relativity | General relativity]] has passed virtually every test over the past century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

### Unverified Experimental Test: Accelerating Charges

An ongoing conceptual test involves comparing the behavior of a stationary charge in a gravitational field to a free-falling one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. A well-known finding is that accelerating charges radiate electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

*   **Newtonian View**: If a more [[newtons_second_law_and_variational_principles | Newtonian picture of gravity]] is correct, a stationary charge should not radiate, but a free-falling one (which is accelerating) should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **General Relativity View**: In contrast, [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | general relativity]] views the free-falling charge as non-accelerating (following a geodesic) and therefore it should not radiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. The stationary charge, however, *is* accelerating (as it deviates from a geodesic) and thus should emit electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

Logistical challenges have prevented this experiment from being carried out, but one's prediction for its outcome reveals one's true understanding of the nature of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The core question remains: Is gravity an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>?

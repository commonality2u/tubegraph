The United States government operates a warehouse that sells a wide variety of materials, many of which are surprising, such as domestic sludge, apple and peach leaves, oyster tissue, bars of zinc metal, carbon dioxide in nitrogen, marine animal samples (mussel, dolphin, whale), bird tissue, and even human tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Perhaps the most unexpected item is peanut butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. These are all [[use_of_standard_reference_materials_in_various_industries | standard reference materials]] (SRMs), meticulously characterized by the [[role_of_the_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology_nist | National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## What are Standard Reference Materials?

[[use_of_standard_reference_materials_in_various_industries | Standard reference materials]] are substances that have been precisely measured and characterized by [[role_of_the_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology_nist | NIST]] over years, often to identify the exact quantities of various compounds within them with specified uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. They are homogenized to ensure consistency across samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. [[role_of_the_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology_nist | NIST]] produces what they call "truth in a bottle," asserting the precise composition of these materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Importance of Standard Reference Materials

The primary purpose of SRMs is to allow researchers and manufacturers to calibrate their equipment and validate their tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Ensuring Accuracy and Calibration
For instance, a standard jar of peanut butter, though inedible due to age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, contains known levels of fats and other compounds, as well as naturally occurring aflatoxins (carcinogens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Manufacturers use this SRM to calibrate their analytical machines, ensuring they can accurately detect both nutritional values and dangerous contaminants like aflatoxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may encourage the use of SRMs for accuracy in commercial laboratories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Consistency Across Industries
The need for standards emerged in the early 1900s due to quality issues with steel used in rail cars. Foundries lacked a way to compare their steel compositions. The National Bureau of Standards (now [[role_of_the_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology_nist | NIST]]) created standard steel samples analyzed for all their constituent elements (chrome, iron, hydrogen, carbon) to ensure everyone was "on the same page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

Another example is Charpies, the best-selling [[role_of_the_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology_nist | NIST]] product, used to test steel strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. These notched steel pieces are used in a pendulum test to measure the energy required to break them. Companies making steel for pipelines, defense industries, or nuclear waste storage must annually check their materials against [[role_of_the_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology_nist | NIST]] Charpies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### Validation in Industry Tests
Some SRMs are used directly in industry tests for consistency. For instance, standard cigarettes are used in tests to determine the flammability of materials in mattresses, sheets, or bed clothes, which has saved many lives by reducing fires caused by smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Similarly, standard bullets with replicated marks are used by forensic labs to validate their equipment when matching crime scene bullets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### [[environmental_monitoring_through_standard_materials | Environmental Monitoring]] and Health
SRMs also play a crucial role in [[environmental_monitoring_through_standard_materials | environmental monitoring]] and health.
*   **House Dust**: Collected from hotels and homes, then homogenized and analyzed, dust SRMs help identify what individuals and their homes are exposed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
*   **Lead Paint, Water, Soil**: [[role_of_the_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology_nist | NIST]] provides SRMs of lead paint, glacier water from Greenland, and contaminated soil from industrial sites to identify dangerous contaminants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Domestic Sludge and Human Poop**: Domestic sludge, a dried powder of solid material from wastewater treatment, allows researchers to examine traces of toxins or heavy metals that people might be exposed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. [[role_of_the_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology_nist | NIST]] is also developing a human poop SRM to support measurements of metabolites related to microbiome health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Emerging Living Standards
As scientific knowledge evolves, so do SRMs. [[role_of_the_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology_nist | NIST]] is preparing its first living standard reference material: hamster ovary cells that produce monoclonal antibodies, which are critical in many top-selling drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. They also created a positive control reference of monkeypox DNA within 30 days of the outbreak to aid diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

## Cost of Standard Reference Materials

SRMs are significantly more expensive than their commercial counterparts. For example, a jar of standard peanut butter costs around $1,000, compared to less than $5 for an ordinary jar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This high cost is not for the material itself, but for the extensive knowledge and painstaking effort involved in characterizing its exact composition. [[role_of_the_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology_nist | NIST]] scientists spend years studying the amount of fat and other compounds in a material to determine the exact numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This rigorous analysis drives the cost of the SRM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

[[role_of_the_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology_nist | NIST]] stores nearly 1300 different SRMs in a 20,000 square foot warehouse and sells approximately 30,000 units annually, generating about $20 million in revenue within the federal government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. While prices are available online, [[role_of_the_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology_nist | NIST]] has some control over who they sell to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

The vast array of [[use_of_standard_reference_materials_in_various_industries | standard reference materials]] produced and distributed by [[role_of_the_national_institute_of_standards_and_technology_nist | NIST]] ensures that the world functions reliably. From the nutritional labels on peanut butter to the structural integrity of steel buildings and the accuracy of medical tests, a dedicated group of people works behind the scenes to verify that what we interact with aligns with established standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

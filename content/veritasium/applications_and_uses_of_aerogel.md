[[aerogel_properties_and_composition | Aerogel]], known as the world's lightest solid, possesses a range of unique properties that make it suitable for diverse applications, from extreme thermal insulation to moisture regulation and even waterproofing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Its [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | nano-structured, sponge-like composition]], with over 50% air by volume and nano-sized pores around 20 nanometers, contributes to its remarkable capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Thermal Insulation

One of the most notable [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | properties of aerogel]] is its exceptional thermal insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Traditional silica aerogel typically has a thermal conductivity of about 15 milliwatts per meter Kelvin, making it 2 to 3 times better at insulating than styrofoam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This capability has led to various applications:

*   **Direct Skin Protection** A combination of silica aerogel particles and a non-flammable binder can form a paste that, when applied to skin, can withstand the heat of a blowtorch flame (which can reach 1500 to 2000 degrees Celsius) without feeling hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. A thin layer of this material, despite becoming orange hot on its exterior, can keep the underlying surface merely warm, demonstrating its extreme insulating power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Insulation Blankets** To overcome aerogel's natural brittleness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, it can be incorporated into [[aerogel_composites_and_materials_innovation | composite materials]], such as fiberglass infused with aerogel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. These [[aerogel_composites_and_materials_innovation | aerogel composites]] retain the insulating properties while becoming flexible, cuttable, and sewable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Such blankets are used to insulate subsea oil pipelines, refineries, and other industrial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. A one-centimeter thick aerogel blanket provides the same insulation as three centimeters of mineral wool or fiberglass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Aerospace Applications** Polymers can also be used to create aerogels, with some, like polyimides developed by NASA, offering good insulation and non-flammability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Future [[development_and_future_applications_of_aerogel | applications in aerospace and space technology]] may include use in astronaut suits or advanced apparel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Moisture Absorption and Regulation

[[hydrophobic_and_hydrophilic_characteristics_of_aerogel | Aerogel]] is highly effective at absorbing liquids due to its large surface area; an ice-cube sized piece can contain half a football field of surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This makes it valuable for various absorption-based applications:

*   **Physical Insecticide** As a physical insecticide, aerogel particles adhere to an insect's outer skin, drawing out moisture and oils, causing the insect to dehydrate, similar to how salt affects a slug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Museum Climate Control** Normal silica aerogel is [[hydrophobic_and_hydrophilic_characteristics_of_aerogel | hydrophilic]], meaning its surface is covered with hydroxyl (OH) groups that attract water molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This characteristic makes it ideal for use in museum display cases as a passive moisture regulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. It absorbs excess moisture when humidity rises and releases it when humidity drops, helping preserve artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Space Exploration (Mars Quakes)** In [[uses_of_aerogel_in_space_exploration | space exploration]], aerogel plays a crucial role. For the NASA InSight mission to detect Mars quakes, zeolite particles dispersed within aerogel were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. These can absorb moisture even at very low pressures, helping to maintain the ultra-high vacuum required by the seismometers for precise measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This passive, power-free vacuum maintenance was essential for the mission's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Waterproofing

While traditional aerogel is hydrophilic, its [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | properties]] can be altered to make it hydrophobic. By replacing just 30% of the internal OH groups with non-polar hydrophobic groups using a reactive chemical, aerogel can be made to completely repel water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This hydrophobic aerogel allows for unique waterproofing applications:

*   **Personal Waterproofing** Coating oneself with tiny hydrophobic aerogel particles creates a layer of air around the skin that repels water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This effect makes the skin appear silvery due to total internal reflection of light at the water-air interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, and also increases buoyancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The water literally does not touch the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Aerogel's versatility, stemming from its modifiable [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | structure]] and [[properties_of_aerogel | properties]], continues to inspire new [[development_and_future_applications_of_aerogel | developments]] and applications across various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

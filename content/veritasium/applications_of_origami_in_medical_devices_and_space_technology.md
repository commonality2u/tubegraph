[[Origami in modern engineering|Engineers are turning to origami for inspiration]] across various fields, including medical devices and space applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The ancient art of paper folding, dating back at least 400 years in Japan, has evolved from a limited number of designs to tens of thousands documented today, largely due to a renaissance inspired by masters like Akira Yoshizawa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

The utility of origami in these modern applications stems from its ability to transform a flat sheet into complex shapes with minimal processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This includes significant size reduction, such as transforming a one-meter square sheet into a small cactus with intricate spines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Additionally, the act of folding a material can inherently increase its rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, and it allows for the manipulation of thick, rigid materials by using surrogate folds, cutting, scoring, and adding hinges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. These [[innovations_in_origamiinspired_technology|innovations in origami-inspired technology]] are scalable, enabling the miniaturization of devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Medical Devices

Origami principles are being applied to create advanced medical tools:
*   **Flexible Catheters:** Origami bellows have been developed for flexible catheters used with surgical robots, such as the Da Vinci surgical robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. These bellows maintain a constant inner hole size, providing support for the catheter as it moves and is inserted into the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Surgical Forceps and Grippers:** [[Origami for structural and mechanical improvements|Functional motions of origami]] are inspiring compliant mechanisms for medical devices. A set of origami-inspired forceps can be miniaturized to allow for smaller incisions while morphing inside the body to become a gripper for more complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. A variant of this mini-gripper is now used in robotic surgeries, reducing the number of parts by 75% compared to previous mechanisms and offering a wider range of motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Microscopic Implants and Nano-injectors:** Origami principles are scalable to a microscopic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Techniques have been developed to create microscopic self-folding origami, such as the world's smallest origami flapping bird, which is smaller than a grain of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. While the bird itself has no direct application, the underlying technique is relevant for microscopic medical devices, implants, and small machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. A nano-injector, used in gene therapy to deliver DNA to cells, is only four micrometers thick, allowing 400 of them to fit onto a one-centimeter wide computer chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Space Technology

Origami designs are particularly valuable for space applications due to the need for compact storage and reliable deployment:
*   **Deployable Solar Panels:** Origami patterns are useful for deploying structures like solar panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   **Miura-ori:** This pattern is considered the "granddaddy" of deployable structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. It was one of the first patterns to fly on a space mission in 1995 as part of the Space Flyer Mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The Miura-ori opens and closes in a single motion, remaining very thin and compact when flattened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    *   **Origami Flasher:** This pattern has been proposed for satellite solar arrays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. It increases compactness for launch and enhances reliability during deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

These applications leverage the inherent benefits of origami, which provides a method of taking a flat sheet of material and forming it into virtually any shape by folding, or if the end product is flat, a way to reduce its dimensions while still deploying easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Translating these ideas into practical solutions requires extensive mathematical modeling and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. [[Mathematical principles in origami design|Mathematical methods]] are crucial for designing complex origami, such as using "circle packing" to represent features like claws, legs, and tails of a scorpion for a crease pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Algorithms like Tomohiro Tachi's "Origamizer" can generate folding patterns for any triangulated surface, allowing a sheet of any material to take on any three-dimensional shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

In popular culture, the term IQ is widely used to refer to intelligence as an objective, rigorous measurement of intellectual ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article explores the scientific basis of IQ tests, what they aim to measure, what they actually measure, and their limitations.

## Origins of Intelligence Testing
The concept of intelligence testing dates back hundreds of years, with the first significant breakthrough occurring in 1904 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Spearman's G-Factor
English psychologist Charles Spearman studied student grades in different subjects and observed a consistent positive correlation: students who performed well in one subject also tended to do well in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. For instance, the correlation coefficient between math and English grades was 0.64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

To explain this, Spearman proposed that each person possesses a level of general intelligence, which he termed the "g-factor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This g-factor was conceptualized as the ability to quickly learn new material, recognize patterns, and think critically across different subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. He believed general intelligence was fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

In addition to the g-factor, Spearman also suggested the existence of "s-factors" (subject-specific factors) to account for the imperfect correlations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. These s-factors could either enhance or diminish performance in a particular subject and were believed to be trainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### The First IQ Test
Around the same time, Alfred Binet in France was tasked with identifying students who needed additional academic support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Collaborating with Theodore Simon, he developed the Binet-Simon test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This test assessed abilities through tasks like identifying missing elements in drawings, defining abstract terms, and repeating sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

Students' performance was compared to average scores of different age groups to assign them a "mental age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The intelligence quotient (IQ) was then calculated by dividing mental age by actual age and multiplying by one hundred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. The Binet-Simon test is recognized as the world's first IQ test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

The test was later translated and brought to the U.S. by Henry Goddard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Lewis Terman at Stanford standardized it using an American sample, leading to the widely used Stanford-Binet test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## How Modern IQ Tests Measure Intelligence
IQ tests aim to measure the g-factor by evaluating a range of mental abilities, including memory, verbal, spatial, and numerical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. By averaging scores across multiple sections, the intention is to minimize subject-specific distortions (s-factors) and approximate general intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

Common sections and question types found on modern IQ tests include:
*   **Vocabulary:** Selecting words with similar or opposite meanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Number Patterns:** Identifying the next number in a sequence based on underlying arithmetic or geometric rules <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Raven's Progressive Matrices:** Completing a 3x3 grid of symbols by identifying patterns based on rules like translational motion, rotational motion, missing symbols, or addition/cancellation of lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Standardization of Scores
To standardize scoring, each test is administered to a large population sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Raw scores are then normalized, typically resulting in a mean IQ of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This means 68% of people score between 85 and 115, and only about 2% score above 130 or below 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## What IQ Tests Predict
IQ scores demonstrate a surprising degree of [[predictive_power_of_iq_scores | predictive power]] across various life outcomes:

*   **Brain Size:** Higher IQ correlates with a larger brain size, with an estimated correlation of 0.33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **School Success:** IQ is a strong predictor of academic performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. A Scottish study found an "extremely high" correlation of about 0.8 between IQ scores at age 11 and national school examination results five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This suggests that about two-thirds of the variation in exam scores could be predicted by IQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. IQ also predicts how much schooling a person will complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Some [[role_of_standardized_tests_like_the_sat_in_college_admissions | standardized tests]] like the SAT, ACT, and GRE correlate with standard IQ tests at around 0.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Job Success:** IQ can predict job success, especially in technical or high-complexity roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Correlations typically range from 0.2 to 0.6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. The U.S. military, for example, sets strict IQ requirements, not accepting anyone with an IQ under 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Longevity:** Studies suggest a correlation between higher IQ and longer lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. One Scottish study found that for every 15-point increase in IQ at age 11, individuals were 27% more likely to be alive at age 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Income:** There is a tendency for income to increase with IQ, with a meta-analysis finding a correlation coefficient of 0.21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. However, this means only 4.4% of the variance in income is explained by IQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The relationship with net worth is even weaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

## [[controversies_and_misconceptions_about_iq | Controversies and Misconceptions about IQ]]
The [[history_and_origins_of_iq_tests | history and origins of IQ tests]] is marked by a "dark history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. While Binet intended his test to identify students needing help, its use shifted in the U.S. to rank adults by intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

### Eugenics Movement
The belief that g-factor was unchangeable and inherited fueled the American eugenics movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This led to laws in many states allowing forced sterilization of individuals who failed to meet certain IQ thresholds, a practice upheld by the Supreme Court in 1927 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Over 60,000 people were forcibly sterilized, and these laws even influenced Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. This "awful history" contributes to why many disregard IQ today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

### Modern Understanding of Intelligence
Modern science recognizes several areas where early researchers were mistaken about intelligence and IQ tests:

*   **Genetics vs. Environment:** IQ is not entirely determined by genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Twin studies suggest that across the lifespan, heritability and environment contribute roughly equally (around 50/50), with estimates ranging from 40% to 70% heritability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **Fixed vs. Changeable:** IQ is not completely fixed over a lifetime, as education can improve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. While scores show consistency (0.5-0.6 correlation over 80 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, they can change.
*   **Single Construct vs. Multiple Intelligences:** Intelligence may not be a single construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. Scientists now often distinguish between:
    *   **Fluid intelligence:** The ability to learn, process new information, and solve novel problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.
    *   **Crystallized intelligence:** The knowledge accumulated over a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
    Fluid intelligence peaks in early adulthood and then declines, while crystallized intelligence remains more stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

### The Flynn Effect
One of the most significant arguments against IQ tests being purely objective measures of intelligence is the Flynn Effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Researcher James Flynn observed that average IQ scores have been steadily increasing by about two to three points per decade over the past century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. If tests weren't periodically re-normalized, the average IQ of the population would appear to have increased by approximately 30 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

Since the genetics of the population haven't changed dramatically over this period, the increase is attributed to environmental [[factors_influencing_iq_scores | factors influencing IQ scores]] such as:
*   Improved childhood nutrition and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.
*   Better education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.
*   A societal shift from manual labor to more abstract thinking in daily work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

The Flynn Effect suggests that IQ tests do not objectively measure a fixed intelligence, but rather are influenced by cultural and societal changes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.

### Cultural Bias and "Culture Fair" Tests
The notion of "culture fair" tests, designed to be equally valid across all cultures, is challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. While these tests often focus on visual relations, geometric shapes, and patterns, they fail to account for fundamental cultural differences, such as language for shapes or spatial relations, or how printed materials are perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

Furthermore, IQ tests typically ignore forms of intelligence crucial in other cultures, such as ethnobotanical knowledge, animal training, or wilderness survival skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. These are considered less common in dominant cultures and lack standardized measurement methods, leading to a bias towards quantifiable puzzles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

## Other [[factors_influencing_iq_scores | Factors Influencing IQ Scores]]
Beyond general intelligence (g-factor), several other factors can affect an individual's IQ score:

*   **Motivation:** Incentivizing test-takers with money can significantly increase scores, especially for those with below-average IQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. Studies show increases of up to 20 points for larger monetary rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.
*   **Training and Coaching:** Familiarity with IQ-style questions and practice can boost scores by up to eight points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. The video's narrator believed his training helped improve his score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.
*   **Test-Taking Strategy:** Skills like time management, skipping difficult questions, eliminating wrong answers, and guessing can influence performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   **Anxiety:** While a small amount of anxiety can be beneficial, excessive anxiety negatively impacts performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.
*   **Openness to Experience:** This is the only personality trait found to correlate with IQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. A willingness to try new things leads to more learning and potentially higher intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

## Modern Applications of IQ Tests
Despite their controversial past and limitations, IQ tests still have relevant applications today:

*   **Legal Cases:** In forensic neuroscience, IQ tests are used in "Atkins defense" cases to determine intellectual disability, which eliminates the death penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. Tests include embedded measures to detect attempts to fake poor performance, with over 95% accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Enhancement and Decline:** Identifying individuals with intellectual disabilities can help in early interventions to boost cognitive ability, potentially delaying functional problems in later life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.
*   **Identifying Talent:** IQ tests can objectively identify individuals with strong intellectual abilities who might not otherwise have the opportunity to demonstrate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. Using standardized IQ tests instead of subjective teacher recommendations has led to a higher proportion of poorer and minority students being identified for gifted and talented programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

## Conclusion
IQ tests measure an individual's g-factor in comparison to the rest of the population, based on standardized raw scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. While they predict aspects of life like school and job success, longevity, and income, they are influenced by numerous [[factors_influencing_iq_scores | factors influencing IQ scores]] beyond innate intelligence, including environment, motivation, and cultural context. The historical misuse of IQ tests in the eugenics movement also highlights their potential for harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

While some psychologists express discomfort with discussing IQ scores due to historical baggage, and there are extreme views on both sides of the debate, a more moderate view recognizes their utility while acknowledging their limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. It's crucial not to equate an IQ score with a person's overall worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>, as other factors like social interaction and continuous learning significantly impact life outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.

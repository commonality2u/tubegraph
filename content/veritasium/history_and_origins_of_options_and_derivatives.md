From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Derivatives are financial securities whose value is derived from another financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. One single equation spawned four multi-trillion dollar industries and transformed approaches to risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Most people are unaware of the size, scale, and utility of derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The core of this equation comes from physics, from discovering atoms, understanding heat transfer, and techniques to beat casino games like blackjack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Early History: Thales of Miletus

The earliest known options were bought around 600 BC by the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Believing the coming summer would yield a bumper crop of olives, Thales secured the option to rent olive presses from existing owners for a specified price by paying a small fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. When the harvest was abundant, the price of renting a press skyrocketed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Thales paid the pre-agreed price and then rented out the machines at a higher rate, pocketing the difference, thus executing the first known call option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Types of Options
*   **Call Option**: Gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset at a later date for a set price (the strike price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. These are useful if the price is expected to go up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Put Option**: Gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset at a later date for the strike price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. These are useful if the price is expected to go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Options offer three main advantages:
1.  **Limited Downside**: They limit potential losses compared to directly buying the underlying asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
2.  **Leverage**: A small investment in an option can yield a much higher percentage return than investing directly in the stock, though with higher potential losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
3.  **Hedging**: Options can be used as a hedge to protect against losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The original motivation for options was to reduce risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Louis Bachelier and the Random Walk

In 1900, Louis Bachelier, a mathematics professor born in 1870, pioneered the use of math to model financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. After selling his father's wine business, he moved to Paris to study physics and found a job at the Bourse, the Paris Stock Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. He was particularly interested in options contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Despite options existing for centuries, no one had found a reliable way to price them; traders simply bargained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Bachelier believed a mathematical solution existed and proposed it as his PhD topic to Henri Poincar√© <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

To price an option accurately, one needs to understand stock price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Bachelier realized that it's impossible to predict all factors influencing stock prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. He assumed that at any given moment, a stock price is equally likely to go up or down, meaning over the long term, stock prices follow a random walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This idea is a hallmark of an efficient market, where predicting prices for profit becomes impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

Bachelier's model showed that a collection of random walks creates a normal distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, where the expected future price of a stock is described by a normal distribution centered on the current price and spreading out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. He rediscovered the exact equation that describes how heat radiates (first discovered by Joseph Fourier in 1822) and called his finding the "radiation of probabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

His work on the random walk also explained Brownian motion, a mystery in [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics_discoveries | physics]] for almost a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Robert Brown observed random movement of pollen grains in water in 1827 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. In 1905, Albert Einstein hypothesized that Brownian motion was caused by trillions of molecules hitting particles from all directions, providing definitive evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Like stock prices, microscopic particles move like a ball in a Galton board, and their expected location is described by a normal distribution that broadens over time (diffusion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

Bachelier's insight for pricing options was that the fair price should make the expected return for both buyers and sellers equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Despite inventing the random walk before Einstein and solving the option pricing problem, his work went largely unnoticed by both physicists and traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

## Ed Thorpe: From Blackjack to Wall Street

In the 1950s, physics graduate Ed Thorpe developed card counting for blackjack, giving him an advantage over casinos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. When casinos adapted, Thorpe took his winnings to the stock market, which he called "the biggest casino on Earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. He started a hedge fund that achieved a 20% annual return for 20 years by transferring his blackjack skills to finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

Thorpe pioneered dynamic hedging, a method to protect against losses through balancing or compensating transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This allowed him to synthetically manufacture an option and make a profit with minimal risk from fluctuating stock prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. Thorpe also developed a more accurate model for option pricing than Bachelier's, one that accounted for the underlying stock's general trend (drift) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. He kept his model quiet for his own investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

## The [[significance_of_the_blackscholesmerton_equation_in_finance | Black-Scholes-Merton Equation]]

In 1973, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, along with Robert Merton (who independently published his own version based on stochastic calculus), developed an equation that revolutionized the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Their approach assumed that if a risk-free portfolio of options and stocks could be constructed (like Thorpe's delta hedging), it should yield only the risk-free rate (e.g., US treasury bonds) in an efficient market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

They used an improved version of Bachelier's model to describe stock price changes, incorporating both random movement and a general trend (drift) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. Combining these elements, they created the most famous equation in finance, capable of pricing any contract tied to any asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

The [[significance_of_the_blackscholesmerton_equation_in_finance | Black-Scholes-Merton equation]] provided an explicit formula for option prices, enabling people to trade with a clear numerical value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. This led to one of the fastest adoptions of an academic idea by industry in the social sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. Within a few years, it became the benchmark for options trading on Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

The exchange-traded options market has since exploded into a multi-trillion dollar industry, with volume doubling roughly every five years, akin to Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. Other multi-trillion dollar industries, such as credit default swaps, OTC derivatives, and securitized debt, also utilize the [[significance_of_the_blackscholesmerton_equation_in_finance | Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing]] idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

This equation allows for accurate and efficient hedging against various risks, for instance, an airline hedging against rising oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. It also provides significant leverage, as seen in the GameStop phenomenon where options trading amplified price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

The global derivative markets are estimated to be several hundred trillion dollars, multiples of the underlying securities they are based on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. While they offer liquidity and stability during normal times, they can exacerbate market crashes during periods of stress, leading to market dislocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

In 1997, Merton and Scholes were awarded the Nobel Prize in economics, with Black acknowledged posthumously for his contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

## Modern Day: Jim Simons and Quantitative Trading

With the [[significance_of_the_blackscholesmerton_equation_in_finance | option pricing formula]] publicly known, hedge funds had to find better ways to identify market inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. This led to the rise of figures like Jim Simons.

Before entering finance, Jim Simons was a renowned mathematician, whose work on Riemann geometry was fundamental to areas like knot theory, quantum field theory, and quantum computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. His Chern-Simons theory provided the mathematical foundation for string theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.

Simons founded Renaissance Technologies in 1978, aiming to use machine learning to uncover patterns in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. His strategy was based on his experience breaking Russian codes during the Cold War by extracting patterns from vast datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. He hired top scientists, often with PhDs in [[role_of_mathematics_and_physics_in_financial_markets | physics]], astronomy, or mathematics, who knew nothing about finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

One such hire was Leonard Baum, a pioneer of Hidden Markov models, which infer unobservable factors that influence observable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. Using these and other data-driven strategies, Renaissance's Medallion fund became the highest-returning investment fund ever, challenging the Efficient Market Hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. This demonstrated that it is possible to beat the market with the right models, training, resources, and computational power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

The impact of mathematicians and physicists in finance goes beyond making them wealthy; by modeling market dynamics, they have provided new insights into risk, opened new markets, accurately priced derivatives, and helped eliminate market inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

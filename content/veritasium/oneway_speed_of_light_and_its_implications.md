Since 1983, the [[Definition of the speed of light | speed of light]] has been precisely defined as 299,792,458 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This value is used to [[Definition of the speed of light | define the meter]] itself: a meter is the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458ths of a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This definition ensures the speed of light is exactly this number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

However, despite this precise definition, no one has ever truly measured the one-way speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## [[Challenges in measuring the oneway speed of light | Challenges in Measuring Oneway Speed]]

Measuring speed typically involves knowing the distance between two points and the time it takes to travel that distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Applying this to light presents unique challenges:

*   **Single Clock Problem**: If you start a timer when a laser beam is fired and stop it when it hits a target one kilometer away, how do you know when the light actually reaches the end if you and the clock are at the starting point? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   **Two Clock Synchronization Problem**:
    *   **Connecting with a Wire**: Using two clocks, one at the start and one at the end, requires them to be synchronized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Connecting them with a wire and sending a pulse for synchronization doesn't work because that pulse travels at the speed of light, introducing an unknown time delay equal to the very thing you're trying to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   **Moving Clocks Apart**: Synchronizing clocks together initially and then moving one to the end point also fails. [[Einsteins theory of relativity | Special relativity]] dictates that moving clocks tick slower relative to stationary observers, meaning they would no longer be in sync upon reaching their destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Moving them very slowly doesn't help either, as time dilation itself depends on the unknown one-way speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## [[Measuring the roundtrip speed of light | Roundtrip Speed of Light]]

The only proven solution to these measurement challenges is to use a single clock and reflect the light back with a mirror, timing the full round trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

*   **Hippolyte Fizeau's Experiment**: The [[History of light theories | first experimental measurement]] of the speed of light was performed by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1849 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. He shone a light beam through a rapidly spinning gear to a mirror 8 kilometers away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. By adjusting the gear's speed, he observed the reflected light passing through the next gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Fizeau measured the speed of light to be 313,000 kilometers per second, which is within 5% of the currently accepted value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **The Limitation**: This and all subsequent direct measurements establish only the *two-way* or *roundtrip* speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The one-way speed of light remains unmeasured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Light Clocks**: Physics diagrams often depict light clocks bouncing light up and back, never in a single direction. This reflects the reality that only the two-way speed of light can be defined as constant for all inertial observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## The Unknowable One-Way Speed

The core of the problem is that we cannot independently measure the one-way speed of light. It's theoretically possible that the speed of light could be different in opposite directions, for example, half of 'c' in one direction and instantaneous in the other, as long as the roundtrip average is 'c' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Implications for Communication and Simultaneity

Consider communicating with an astronaut on Mars, "Mark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

*   **Scenario 1 (Einstein Convention)**: A signal is sent from Earth, and a response is received 20 minutes later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Under the standard assumption that light travels at 'c' in both directions, we deduce the signal took 10 minutes to reach Mars and the reply took 10 minutes to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Scenario 2 (Asymmetric Speed)**: Imagine the message takes the full 20 minutes to reach Mars, and the reply comes back instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. There is no way to experimentally distinguish this from the first scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

This implies that if the speed of light *is* different in different directions, and physicists unknowingly use the standard [[Definition of the speed of light | Einstein synchronization convention]]:

*   **Clock Desynchronization**: When Earth sends a message at 12:00 PM and Mark receives it, assuming it took 10 minutes, he sets his clock to 12:10 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. However, if the message actually took 20 minutes to reach him (and returned instantaneously), it would be 12:20 PM on Earth when he sets his clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. His clock would be 10 minutes behind Earth's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Unrecognizable Error**: Both parties would still perceive successful synchronization based on their local time delays, but their clocks would be out of sync, and they would have no way to recognize or correct this error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Perception of Reality**: In the extreme case of instantaneous return, an observer on Earth could be seeing Mars and distant stars *exactly as they are right now*, while an observer on Mars would still see Earth as it was 20 minutes ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## Einstein Synchronization Convention

The idea that light travels at the same speed in all directions is not an experimentally verified fact, but a *convention* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

*   **Einstein's 1905 Paper**: In his famous 1905 paper "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies," [[Einsteins theory of relativity | Einstein]] addressed the problem of synchronizing clocks at different locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. He stated that a meaningful comparison of times requires defining "that the time required by light to travel from A to B equals the time it requires to travel from B to A" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Stipulation**: Einstein emphasized this as a "by definition" or "stipulation" made "of my own free will" to define simultaneity, rather than a hypothesis about the physical [[Nature of light | nature of light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This is known as the [[Definition of the speed of light | Einstein synchronization convention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **GPS**: The entire GPS system is based on this assumption that the speed of light is the same in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. If it were different, GPS synchronized clocks would still *measure* the one-way speed of light to be 'c' even if it wasn't, because their synchronization method relies on that assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## The Philosophical Debate

The inability to measure the one-way speed of light has led to an ongoing debate among physicists since 1905 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

*   **Occam's Razor**: Some physicists argue that it is simpler to assume light travels at the same speed in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   **Conventionalism**: Most working physicists accept the convention and move on, but it's important to acknowledge it as a convention, not an empirically verified fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **The Unknowable**: The fact that this aspect of the universe is "hidden" from us is fascinating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. While the roundtrip speed of light is 'c', the one-way speed may not have a well-defined value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This raises questions about the concept of simultaneity and whether it makes sense to talk about things happening at the same time if they are separated by distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **Future Implications**: It's possible that this inability to measure the one-way speed of light could be a crucial clue for future breakthroughs in physics, connecting [[Einsteins theory of relativity | General Relativity]], Quantum Mechanics, space, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

The [[Hilbert Hotel and Infinite Rooms | Hilbert Hotel]] is a theoretical establishment with an [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinite]] number of rooms, numbered one, two, three, and so on, forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While it might seem capable of accommodating anyone, there is a limit to even its [[the_different_sizes_of_infinity | infinite]] capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Accommodating New Guests

When the [[Hilbert Hotel and Infinite Rooms | Hilbert Hotel]] is full with an [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinite]] number of guests occupying its [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinite]] rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>:

### A Single New Guest

If a single new guest arrives, the hotel manager can accommodate them by asking every existing guest to move down one room (e.g., guest in room one moves to room two, guest in room two moves to room three, and so on) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This frees up room one for the new guest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### A Finite Number of New Guests

For a bus carrying a finite number of people, such as a hundred guests, the same principle applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. All existing guests move down a corresponding number of rooms (e.g., 100 rooms), vacating the first 100 rooms for the new arrivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### An [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | Infinite]] Number of New Guests

When an [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinitely]] long bus arrives, carrying [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinitely]] many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, the manager can instruct existing guests to move to the room number that is double their current room number (e.g., room one to room two, room two to room four) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This makes all odd-numbered rooms available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Since there are an [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinite]] number of odd numbers, each person from the [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinite]] bus can be assigned a unique odd-numbered room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### An [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | Infinite]] Number of [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | Infinite]] Buses

If an [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinite]] number of [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinite]] buses show up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, the manager can use an [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinite]] spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This spreadsheet lists each bus and the people within it, along with the existing hotel guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. By drawing a zigzagging line across this infinite-by-infinite grid, traversing each unique guest identifier exactly once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, the manager effectively straightens the grid into a single [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinite]] line of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Each person on this line can then be assigned a unique room in the hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## The Limit: [[Concept of Countably vs Uncountably Infinite | Uncountably Infinite]] Guests

Despite the seemingly limitless capacity, the [[Hilbert Hotel and Infinite Rooms | Hilbert Hotel]] faces a true limit when confronted with an [[concept_of_countably_vs_uncountably_infinite | uncountably infinite]] number of guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### The [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | Infinite]] Party Bus

Imagine a party bus carrying guests identified by [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinitely]] long names, each consisting only of the letters 'A' and 'B' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Every possible [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinite]] sequence of 'A's and 'B's represents a unique guest on this bus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

The manager must explain that these guests cannot all be accommodated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### The Diagonalization Argument

To demonstrate this, the manager creates an [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinite]] list, attempting to assign each hotel room to a guest's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Even with such a complete [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinite]] list, it is possible to construct a name that is not on the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

This is done by:
1.  Taking the first letter of the first name on the list and flipping it (A to B, or B to A) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
2.  Taking the second letter of the second name on the list and flipping it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
3.  Continuing this process down the entire [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinite]] list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

The resulting name is guaranteed to be different from every name on the list by at least one character (the character on the diagonal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This proves that no matter how many rooms are assigned, there will always be a guest from the party bus who does not have a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## [[The Different Sizes of Infinity | Different Sizes of Infinities]]

The number of rooms in the [[Hilbert Hotel and Infinite Rooms | Hilbert Hotel]] is [[concept_of_countably_vs_uncountably_infinite | countably infinite]], meaning there are as many rooms as there are positive integers (one to [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | infinity]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. In contrast, the number of people on the "infinite party bus" is [[concept_of_countably_vs_uncountably_infinite | uncountably infinite]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. If one attempts to match each of these guests with an integer, there will always be people left over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

This illustrates that [[the_different_sizes_of_infinity | some infinities are bigger than others]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The discovery of [[implications_of_different_sized_infinities | different sized infinities]] directly led to the invention of modern computing devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

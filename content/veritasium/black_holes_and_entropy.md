[[black holes and event horizons | Black holes]] are a significant source of [[entropy and the second law of thermodynamics | entropy]] in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.

## Bekenstein's Proposal
In 1972, Jacob Bekenstein proposed that the [[entropy and the second law of thermodynamics | entropy]] of a [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] should be proportional to its surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. This means that as a [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] grows, its [[entropy and the second law of thermodynamics | entropy]] increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

Initially, many physicists found this idea to be nonsensical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. According to classical thermodynamics, if [[black holes and event horizons | black holes]] possess [[entropy and the second law of thermodynamics | entropy]], they should also have a temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. If they have a temperature, they should emit radiation, which would mean they are not truly "black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.

## Hawking Radiation
Stephen Hawking initially set out to disprove Bekenstein's theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. However, his research surprisingly confirmed that [[black holes and event horizons | black holes]] do indeed emit radiation, now known as [[How light behaves around black holes | Hawking radiation]], and thus have a temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

For instance, the [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] at the center of the Milky Way galaxy has an extremely low temperature, approximately one hundred trillionth of a Kelvin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. The radiation it emits is far too weak to be detected, meaning it remains practically "black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

Hawking's work confirmed Bekenstein's hypothesis regarding [[entropy and the second law of thermodynamics | entropy]] in [[black holes and event horizons | black holes]] and allowed for a refinement of the calculation of their [[entropy and the second law of thermodynamics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

## Black Holes and Universal Entropy
The supermassive [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] at the center of the Milky Way contains roughly 10<sup>91</sup> Boltzmann constants of [[entropy and the second law of thermodynamics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. This amount is 1,000 times greater than the [[entropy and the second law of thermodynamics | entropy]] of the early observable universe and 10 times more than all other particles combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

Collectively, all [[black holes and event horizons | black holes]] are estimated to account for 3 x 10<sup>104</sup> Boltzmann constants of [[entropy and the second law of thermodynamics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. This indicates that almost all of the universe's [[entropy and the second law of thermodynamics | entropy]] is concentrated within [[black holes and event horizons | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

The early universe had a significantly lower [[entropy and the second law of thermodynamics | entropy]] â€” about 0.000000000000003% of its current [[entropy and the second law of thermodynamics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. The continuous increase in the universe's [[entropy and the second law of thermodynamics | entropy]] drives all phenomena, from the formation of planetary systems and galaxies to the flourishing of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. This unidirectional increase in [[entropy and the second law of thermodynamics | entropy]] is directly linked to [[The Arrow of Time and Entropy | the arrow of time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.

## Overview of the [[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | Manhattan Project]]

The [[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | Manhattan Project]] was a top-secret United States initiative during [[historical_context_of_world_war_ii_and_nuclear_arms_race | World War II]] with the explicit goal of developing an [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic bomb]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. The project was put under the charge of General Leslie Groves on September 18, 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:01">[11:21:01]</a>.

From day one, Groves took decisive action, ordering 1200 tons of uranium ore and acquiring the Oak Ridge site for ore refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:01">[11:31:01]</a>.

Initially, [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] estimated the project would require about six scientists supported by engineers and technicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:07">[14:07:07]</a>. However, the scale of the project grew immensely, ultimately involving:
*   764 scientists working for the [[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | Manhattan Project]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>
*   302 scientists specifically at the [[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | Los Alamos site]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:27">[14:26:27]</a>
*   Over 600,000 people in total contributing to the making of the [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic bomb]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:04">[14:33:04]</a>

### Genesis of the Project

The idea of a nuclear weapon gained traction after Leo Szilard's theory of a nuclear chain reaction in 1933 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:08">[06:55:08]</a>. The successful splitting of a uranium atom by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in January 1939 further spurred concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:08">[07:38:08]</a>. Although initially skeptical, [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] quickly grasped the potential for a chain reaction to generate power or bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

In August 1939, Albert Einstein, who had previously considered nuclear bombs impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>, signed a letter (written by Szilard) to President Franklin Roosevelt, warning about the possibility of [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | nuclear weapons]] and Germany's access to uranium from Czechoslovakia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. This led to an informal uranium committee, which was upgraded to the S-1 committee in 1941, reporting directly to the White House with the goal of developing an [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic bomb]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

On December 2, 1942, a team led by Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago created the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, Pile-1, located under a football field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>. This confirmed the feasibility of controlled nuclear reactions, suggesting that if a nuclear power plant could be made, so could a bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

## [[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | Los Alamos Laboratory]]

In October 1942, General Groves made the surprising decision to choose [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] as the science director of the soon-to-be-established [[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | Los Alamos laboratory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

### Selection of [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]]

Concerns were raised about [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]]'s selection due to:
*   Lack of a Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>
*   No prior administrative experience over a large project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>
*   His background as a theoretical physicist, deemed "very impractical" by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>
*   Links to the Communist Party, including his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>

Despite these concerns, Groves was impressed by [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]]'s "overwhelming ambition" and his ability to understand problems across physics, chemistry, engineering, and metallurgy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. Groves considered him a "real genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. The decision to hire [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] for this role was later described by Isador Rabi as "a real stroke of genius" on Groves' part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

### Location

[[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | The Manhattan Project]] required an isolated, secret location, safe from attack and sparsely populated in case of an accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] proposed [[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | Los Alamos, New Mexico]], a place he had "fallen in love with" in his twenties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>.

> "My two great loves are physics and New Mexico. It's a pity they can't be combined." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>

### Bomb Design Work

Scientists at [[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | Los Alamos]] worked on different [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | bomb designs]]:

#### Gun-Type Design
For the first few years, scientists worked on a gun-type [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | bomb design]] using uranium-235 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. This design involves two sub-critical masses of uranium-235 which are rapidly fired together using conventional explosives to create a combined mass above the critical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>. The chain reaction begins when the uranium bullet is about 25 centimeters away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>. Challenges included ensuring smooth sliding of the uranium, which was eventually solved by using sperm whale oil for lubrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

#### Implosion Bomb Design
A new element, plutonium-239, synthesized in 1941, was found to be a great fuel for a [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | nuclear bomb]] with a critical mass of only about 10 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>. However, it reacts too quickly for a gun-type device, leading to a "fizzle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>.

The solution was the implosion [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | bomb design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>. This method compresses a sub-critical mass of plutonium by detonating conventional explosives around it, increasing its density and lowering its critical mass to start a nuclear chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.

To enhance efficiency, the sphere of plutonium was surrounded by a neutron-reflecting material, and a neutron source was included to kick-start the chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a>. The "urchin," a tiny pellet made of beryllium and polonium separated by nickel and gold, was designed for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>. When the explosives detonated, the shockwave would mix the beryllium and polonium, causing the beryllium to release a flood of neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>.

### The [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Trinity]] Test

The first [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic bomb]] test, codenamed [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Trinity]], was scheduled for July 16, 1945, just one day before the Potsdam conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>. The test was delayed due to a storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>.

[[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] was nervous before the test, reciting a stanza from the Bhagavad Gita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>. A major concern among scientists, discussed by [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] and Arthur Compton around 1942, was the "terrible possibility" that the nuclear test could end the world by setting fire to the atmosphere through fusion of hydrogen or nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>. However, most scientists quickly deemed this scenario unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:00]</a>.

At 5:29:21 AM, the "gadget"—the world's first nuclear bomb—detonated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>. The implosion design worked as planned:
*   High explosives squeezed the plutonium core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>
*   The shockwave mixed beryllium and polonium, releasing neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>
*   The urchin successfully jump-started the nuclear reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:00">[23:40:00]</a>

The explosion, equivalent to nearly 25,000 tons of TNT, illuminated the [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | New Mexico mountains]] brighter than daytime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a>. The shockwave was felt over 160 kilometers away, and the mushroom cloud rose 12 kilometers into the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:59:00">[23:59:00]</a>. The heat was so intense it melted desert sand into a glassy mineral known as trinitite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>. Fortunately, the blast did not ignite the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>.

> In 1965, recalling the moments after the [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Trinity]] test, [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] stated he thought of another verse from the Gita: "Now I am become death the destroyer of worlds." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>

### Aftermath of [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | Nuclear Weapons]]

On August 6, 1945, the "Little Boy," a gun-type [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | nuclear bomb]] with 64 kilograms of enriched uranium, was dropped on [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Hiroshima]], killing nearly 70,000 people instantly, with another 70,000 dying from burns and radiation poisoning in subsequent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>. Three days later, an implosion-type [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | bomb]] was dropped on [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Nagasaki]], killing an estimated 80,000 more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:57:00">[24:57:00]</a>. Over 95% of the 225,000 people killed in both bombings were civilians, mostly women and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>.

After the war, [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] became a national hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:23:00">[26:23:00]</a>. He became director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton in 1947 and chairman of the General Advisory Committee, where he advocated for [[ethical_implications_and_aftermath_of_nuclear_weapons | arms control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a>.

The Soviet Union's testing of their first [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic weapon]] in August 1949 led the US military to develop a more powerful weapon, the hydrogen bomb, or "The Super" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:51:00">[26:51:00]</a>. [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] opposed its [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | development]] on [[ethical_implications_and_aftermath_of_nuclear_weapons | ethical grounds]] and fear of a [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cold_war_strategies | nuclear arms race]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>. Despite his opposition, Truman's administration proceeded, and "Ivy Mike," the first hydrogen bomb, was tested in the [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Marshall Islands]] three years later, with a yield 400 times more powerful than the [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Trinity]] test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:18:00">[27:18:00]</a>.

A hydrogen bomb is a three-stage device: a conventional bomb triggers a fission bomb, which then generates temperatures and pressures high enough to fuse deuterium and tritium, releasing immense energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40:00">[27:40:00]</a>. This [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cold_war_strategies | arms race]] continued, with the Soviet Union testing the "Tsar Bomba" in 1961, the most powerful explosion ever detonated, approximately 2000 times more powerful than [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Trinity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:00:00">[28:00:00]</a>.

[[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]]'s opposition to the hydrogen bomb and calls for averting a [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cold_war_strategies | nuclear arms race]] led to his security clearance being suspended in December 1953, effectively putting him on trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>. He had been surveilled even during the [[manhattan_project_and_los_alamos_laboratory | Manhattan Project]], with many wiretaps being illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:30:00">[28:30:00]</a>. He was questioned about ties to the Communist Party and accused of treason and espionage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>.

> In 1965, when asked about halting the proliferation of [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | nuclear weapons]], [[life_and_impact_of_j_robert_oppenheimer | Oppenheimer]] responded, "It should have been done the day after [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Trinity]]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:36:00">[30:36:00]</a>

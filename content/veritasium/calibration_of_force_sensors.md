Accurate measurement of forces is critical in many fields, from everyday objects like an apple (approximately 1 newton) to massive structures and propulsion systems like jet engines (570,000 newtons) and the Saturn V rocket (33,360,000 newtons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To measure such large forces precisely, specialized equipment and rigorous [[minimizing_uncertainty_in_force_measurement | calibration methods]] are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Dead Weight Machine

Rick Seifarth, a physical scientist in the Mass and Force Group, manages a unique [[measurement_of_large_forces | dead weight machine]] capable of applying 4,448,222 newtons of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This specific number is equivalent to exactly 1,000,000 pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The machine consists of twenty 50,000-pound increments, cumulatively reaching 4.45 meganewtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

It is believed that these are the largest mass objects ever calibrated anywhere in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Another machine of its type, with a capacity of 13.3 meganewtons (three million pounds force), is also considered one of a kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### How it Works

The dead weight machine operates by utilizing the precisely known weight of 20 carefully calibrated masses located below ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. These weights are used to calibrate force sensors, also known as force transducers, in an upstairs laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

1.  **Setup**: A force transducer is placed on a compression head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  **Lifting Mechanism**: A hydraulic ram in the attic raises a green lifting frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
3.  **Weight Suspension**: As the force transducer contacts a red loading frame, it begins to lift the weights downstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
4.  **Calibration**: As the lifting frame continues to rise, more of the 50,000-pound weights become suspended by the force sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Since the force created by these weights is accurately known, the readouts from the force transducer can be precisely calibrated against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Applications of Calibrated Sensors

Once calibrated, these force transducers are deployed in various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. For example, they are embedded in test stands to monitor forces during rocket engine firing, allowing engineers to precisely track power levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Minimizing Uncertainty

The precision in calibrating these forces is exceptionally high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Each 50,000-pound mass, equivalent to ten minivans, has its exact value known to within the weight of several American nickels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

This tiny uncertainty is achieved by referencing the very definition of the kilogram, using K20 â€“ the United States fundamental mass standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The process involves:
*   Comparing combinations of known weights, starting with K20, to larger unknown weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   Gradually scaling up, for instance, comparing a 5-kilogram mass to a combination of two 2-kilogram and one 1-kilogram masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   Converting to pounds and progressing through 50-pound, 500-pound, 2500-pound, 10,000-pound, 20,000-pound, and 30,000-pound masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   Finally, combinations of these huge weights are used to calibrate the 50,000-pound masses of the weight stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

The vertical force generated by these weights is guaranteed with an uncertainty of 0.0005%, or five parts per million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This means at the full one million pounds of applied force, the accuracy is within five pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

To achieve this precision, several factors are taken into account:
*   **Gravitational Acceleration**: The local gravitational acceleration, which is slightly less than Earth's standard gravity, necessitates adding an additional 600 pounds to the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Buoyant Force**: The buoyant force exerted by the air on the masses, displacing 125 pounds of air, requires a further 125 pounds to be added to reach the target million pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Importance of Accurate Physical Testing

The existence of such a precise [[measurement_of_large_forces | measurement of large forces]] system underscores the [[importance_of_accurate_physical_testing | importance of accurate physical testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. As an axiom states, "one physical test is worth a thousand expert opinions," especially in the world of [[verification_of_physical_theories | physical testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. When it comes to critical applications like aerospace engineering, an acceptable uncertainty on force measurements cannot be 10%, but must be "down in the mud" for safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

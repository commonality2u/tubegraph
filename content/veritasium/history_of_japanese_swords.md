Japanese swords are renowned for their strength and sharpness, capable of slicing a bullet in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The traditional methods of making these swords have remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years, with everything done by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. They are still considered among the best in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, representing the absolute pinnacle for their style of warfare and the materials available at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Such is their high regard that a 16th-century Japanese sword was appraised at $105 million, making it the most expensive sword ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Early Origins and Materials

Sword making in Japan dates back approximately 3000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. In these early days, swords were crafted from bronze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Bronze, an alloy primarily of copper and tin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, could be smelted in regular pottery kilns due to its components' low melting points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. However, bronze swords, though sharpenable, were too soft to maintain an edge for long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Japan's geology, being mostly volcanic, lacks the sedimentary banded iron formations that provide most of the world's iron supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This likely explains why the country was late to steel production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. While steel artifacts nearly 4,000 years old have been found in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, Japan imported metals, including steel, from China and Korea until the eighth century when it began making its own steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Sourcing Iron Sand

The raw ingredients for Japanese steel came from [[iron_sand_collection_and_smelting_in_japan | iron sand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Igneous rocks contain iron oxides in low concentrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, which are broken apart by weathering and washed downstream to become part of the sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. The Japanese observed that iron oxides, being denser, accumulate in river sections where the river changes direction or speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. To enhance this, they deliberately created diversions in rivers, damming sections and dragging sand into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This method yields iron sands with up to 80% iron oxides by weight, making it a highly concentrated source for quality steel with fewer impurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## The Tatara Method

The [[traditional_japanese_sword_making_process | traditional Japanese sword making process]] involves the Tatara method, which has been used for 1300 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This method is crucial as only steel made this way is used in the best Japanese swords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The process begins with ceremonial prayers and lighting the fire in the smelter by a Shinto priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The smelter workers remain there for at least 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. [[steel_alloying_and_sword_forging_techniques | Steel is an alloy of iron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. To create steel, iron oxides are heated above 1,250 degrees Celsius to break bonds with oxygen and yield pure iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Pure iron is softer than bronze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Charcoal, which is pure carbon, is used for heating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Adding a small amount of carbon to iron creates steel, an incredibly strong alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

> "A lot of people see it as a heat process. I see it as a chemical process." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>

Alloys are stronger because different sized atoms reduce the ability of atoms to slide past each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Charcoal and iron sand, mixed with water to prevent it from flying up (but not too much to avoid explosions), are added to the smelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The mixture ratio is determined by feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Over hours, hundreds of kilograms of charcoal and iron sand are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

High temperatures (up to 1500 degrees Celsius) are maintained by a strong, steady supply of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Historically, this was done with huge foot-operated bellows, requiring around-the-clock effort from many men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Today, electric bellows are often used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

The iron being smelted remains soft and malleable rather than liquid, clumping into a large block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Impurities like sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon oxides combine with carbon from the charcoal to form slag, which melts at a lower temperature and flows to the bottom, being periodically removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. After 21 hours of smelting, a 100-kilogram block of steel, iron, and slag is produced, though only about a third is high enough quality for sword making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

## Forging and Shaping

The resulting steel is sorted by quality and carbon content, a process done by eye and part of the swordsmith certification exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The sorted steel is then sent to swordsmiths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

The [[steel_alloying_and_sword_forging_techniques | forging of the sword]] begins by heating the steel in a coal oven with bellows until it's soft and malleable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. The master swordsmith flattens the steel with hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Historically, this involved the swordsmith and three apprentices, but modern electric hammers are used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

The flattened steel is then bent back on itself and hammered again to press it into a solid block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. This folding process is vital for two reasons:
1.  **Spreading Impurities**: It spreads out impurities like silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus, ensuring uniform consistency and preventing weak points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
2.  **Creating Grain**: It gives the steel a grain, reinforcing the sword in the direction it will be hit in combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Additionally, exposure to air during folding causes a small amount of oxidation, creating beautiful patterns in the steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

While some swords have over a billion layers (achieved by about 30 folds, as each fold doubles the layers), typical swords are folded 10 to 13 times, resulting in a few thousand layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

A blade is not made from a single block of steel; different carbon contents are used for different parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Higher carbon content makes steel harder and more rigid but also more brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Therefore, the edge of the sword is high-carbon steel for sharpness, while the spine uses lower-carbon steel to allow flexibility without breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. This is achieved by welding together pieces of steel with varying carbon levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

### Quenching and the Iconic Curve

After the sword is hammered into a straight blade, it's covered in a layer of clay â€“ thick for the spine and thin for the blade edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. It's then heated and rapidly cooled in water, a process called quenching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

The differential cooling rates, due to the clay thickness, are critical:
*   **Spine (thick clay)**: Cools slowly, allowing carbon atoms to leave the iron matrix, forming a low-carbon steel called ferrite and cementite, combined as perlite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Perlite is a mostly soft and ductile form of steel, suitable for the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   **Edge (thin clay)**: Cools rapidly, trapping more carbon in the lattice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. This forces the lattice structure to change from cubic to tetragonal, creating martensite, an incredibly hard form of steel ideal for the sword's edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

The tetragonal lattice structure of martensite takes up more space, causing the blade's edge to expand relative to the spine, resulting in the iconic curve of a samurai sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. The boundary between these steel types is visible in the finished sword as a difference in color, known as hamon (edge pattern) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. About one-third of all blades shatter during quenching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. After quenching, the sword is reheated to evaporate water and loosen some crystal structures, making it less brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

## Finishing and Legacy

Once forged, the sword is sent to a polisher. [[artistry_and_craftsmanship_in_japanese_swords | Polishing and sharpening]] are done by hand using whetstones of different coarsenesses, a process that can take a month for a single sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Occasionally, swords are also engraved with intricate patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

The entire process, from gathering and refining iron sand to smelting, forging, and sharpening, demands immense time, skill, and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. It is remarkable that these high-quality artifacts, still prized centuries later, were developed through trial and error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. Japanese swords exemplify how deep care, attention to detail, and love for the craft can elevate an object to a work of art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

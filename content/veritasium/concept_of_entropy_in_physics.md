From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

[[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | Entropy]] is a fundamental concept in physics that governs a vast range of phenomena, from molecular interactions to the evolution and eventual end of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. It may even determine the direction of time and be essential for the existence of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

A common misunderstanding about energy transfer is highlighted by the question of what the Earth receives from the Sun. While most people correctly identify energy, warmth, light, or Vitamin D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, it's less commonly known that the Earth radiates back approximately the same amount of energy it receives from the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. If it didn't, the Earth's temperature would continually rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. This points to the idea that the crucial transfer from the Sun is not just energy, but a specific quality or state of energy.

## Historical Development

The understanding of [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] has roots in the study of heat engines in the 19th century.

### Sadi Carnot and the Ideal Heat Engine

In 1813, a 17-year-old student named Sadi Carnot sought to join the French military effort against invading armies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. After witnessing the fall of Paris, he later discussed steam engines with his father, a physicist who had studied the efficient transfer of energy in mechanical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Recognizing that national industrial and military strength depended on superior steam engines, Carnot aimed to improve their efficiency, which at the time was only about 3% in converting thermal energy into mechanical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

Carnot's key insight involved describing an ideal heat engine, one without friction or energy losses to the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. This engine operates between a hot and a cold reservoir, transferring heat to produce mechanical work through a cyclical process of expansion and compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. A notable feature of Carnot's ideal engine is its complete reversibility: running it in reverse would return all components to their original state with no net energy input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

Despite its ideal nature, this engine cannot achieve 100% efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. Its efficiency is calculated as the ratio of work done to the heat input from the hot source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. It fundamentally depends only on the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs, not on the materials or specific design of the engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. To achieve 100% efficiency, the hot side would need infinite temperature or the cold side absolute zero, neither of which is practically possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. This limitation arises because heat must be "dumped" into the cold reservoir to complete the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

Real-world engines operate far below their theoretical maximum efficiency due to friction, heat dissipation to the environment, and non-constant temperature heat transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. When energy spreads out in these irreversible processes, it becomes unusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. Energy is most useful when concentrated and less useful when dispersed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

### Rudolf Clausius and the Laws of Thermodynamics

Decades later, German physicist Rudolf Clausius studied Carnot's engine and devised a way to quantify how "spread out" energy is, naming this quantity [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. When energy is concentrated (e.g., in a hot bar), it represents low [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. As energy disperses to the surroundings, [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. This means the energy is present but less available to do work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

In 1865, Clausius summarized the first two laws of thermodynamics:
1.  The energy of the universe is constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
2.  The [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] of the universe tends to a maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. This means energy naturally spreads out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.

## Implications of the Second Law of Thermodynamics

The [[the_second_law_of_thermodynamics | second law of thermodynamics]] underpins many everyday phenomena:
*   Hot objects cool down, and cool objects heat up to reach equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.
*   Gas expands to fill a container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.
*   Perpetual motion machines are impossible because the amount of usable energy in a closed system constantly decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.

While [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] is often described as "disorder," a better way to conceptualize it is as the tendency of energy to spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.

### Entropy and the Arrow of Time

Most laws of physics are reversible, meaning they work the same forwards or backwards in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. However, the consistent spreading of energy gives time a clear direction. Ludwig Boltzmann made the crucial insight that seemingly impossible events, like heat flowing from cold to hot, are not impossible, but merely highly improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

Using a model of energy packets hopping between atoms in hot and cold bars, it can be shown that configurations where energy is evenly spread are far more numerous and therefore overwhelmingly more likely than configurations where energy concentrates unevenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. For systems with a macroscopic number of atoms (like 100 trillion trillion atoms), the probability of energy reversing its spread becomes astronomically small, effectively never happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>. This is analogous to a Rubik's cube: there's only one solved state, but quintillions of messy states, so random turns inevitably lead to disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. The tendency of energy to spread from unlikely to more likely states defines the arrow of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07:00">[24:07:00]</a>.

### Local Decreases in Entropy

While total [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] in a closed system must increase, local decreases in [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] are possible, such as an air conditioner cooling a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. This is only possible if a greater increase in [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] occurs elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>. For an air conditioner, this increase happens at the power plant, where concentrated chemical energy in coal is broadly dispersed as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>.

## Entropy and Life

If [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] is constantly increasing, how can complex structures and life exist on Earth? The Earth is not a closed system; it receives a steady stream of low-entropy (concentrated) energy from the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. This concentrated solar energy is more usable than the energy the Earth radiates back into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>. Plants capture this energy, and through food chains, this energy is used by organisms to maintain their complex bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. At each step, energy becomes more dispersed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00">[16:58:00]</a>.

Ultimately, all solar energy reaching Earth is converted to thermal energy and radiated back into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. The increase in [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] can be observed in the photon exchange: for each high-energy photon received from the Sun, Earth emits about 20 lower-energy photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. All processes on Earth, including life, are part of this conversion of fewer, high-energy photons into many more, lower-energy photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>. Without a source of concentrated energy and a way to discard spread-out energy, life would be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>.

Some theories suggest that life itself may be a consequence of the [[the_second_law_of_thermodynamics | second law of thermodynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>. If the universe tends toward maximum [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]], life offers an efficient way to accelerate this natural tendency, being "spectacularly good at converting low [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] into high [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>. Jeremy England proposed that a constant stream of clumped energy could favor structures that dissipate that energy, leading to increasingly effective dissipators and eventually, life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.

## Entropy of the Universe

The Sun receives its low [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] from the universe itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>. The total [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] of the universe is continually increasing, implying it was much lower in the past, all the way back to the Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>. This is known as the "past hypothesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>.

The early universe was hot, dense, and almost completely uniform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. While this might seem like high [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] (disorder), when gravity is considered, having matter spread out uniformly is an extremely unlikely state, thus representing very low [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>. As the universe expanded and cooled, gravity caused matter to clump together, converting potential energy into kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>. Collisions converted some of this kinetic energy into heat, increasing [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] as useful energy decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>. This process led to the formation of stars, planets, galaxies, and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>.

In 1972, Jacob Bekenstein proposed that [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black holes]] are a significant source of [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]], proportional to their surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>. Stephen Hawking initially sought to disprove this but found that [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black holes]] do emit radiation (Hawking radiation) and have a temperature, confirming Bekenstein's idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:00]</a>. [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | Black holes]] account for the vast majority of the universe's [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]], with the supermassive [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] at the Milky Way's center alone possessing 1,000 times more [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] than the early observable universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:00">[22:49:00]</a>.

The universe began with extremely low [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]], and its continuous increase allows for all cosmic phenomena and defines the one-way progression from past to future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>.

## The Heat Death of the Universe

The process of increasing [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] is expected to continue until energy is so completely spread out that no further interesting events can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>. This is known as the "heat death of the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>. In the distant future, after the last [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] has evaporated, the universe will reach its most probable state. At this point, the arrow of time would disappear as there would be no distinguishable difference between time moving forwards or backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>.

However, while maximum [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] means low complexity, low [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] does not mean maximum complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>. Complex structures, like intricate patterns formed when tea and milk mix, emerge in the middle stages of [[role_of_entropy_in_life_and_the_universe | entropy]] increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>. Humanity exists in this transitional period, where complex structures appear and thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:30:00">[25:30:00]</a>.

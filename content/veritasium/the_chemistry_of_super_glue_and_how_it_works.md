Super glue is a powerful adhesive where a single drop can support over three tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Its rapid setting time and strong bonding capabilities are due to its unique chemical composition and reaction mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Chemical Composition and Setting Process

Super glue, in its liquid form, is composed of identical monomer molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The primary molecule is ethyl cyanoacrylate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. When applied between two surfaces, this liquid flows into all available pores and crevices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

The monomers then undergo a rapid reaction, joining together to form long polymer chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This process transforms the glue from a liquid into a solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Once solidified, the polymer chains are stuck within the cracks and crevices, thereby connecting the two surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This explains why super glue sticks poorly to very smooth surfaces, as there are few crevices for it to cling to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Sanding surfaces can improve adhesion by introducing texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## The Role of Reactivity

Ethyl cyanoacrylate is highly reactive due to the presence of two double bonds and one triple bond positioned closely together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Specifically, a double bond is attached to a nitrile group and an ester group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The chemistry of these groups makes the double bond highly electron deficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Oxygen and nitrogen atoms attract electrons more strongly than carbon atoms, leaving a carbon atom slightly positively charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This "hungry" carbon is ready to react with anything even slightly electronegative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

In the presence of a negative ion, the carbon double bond breaks, forming four single bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The electronegative nitrile and ester groups pull the extra electron across the molecule, making another carbon negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This attracts another slightly positive carbon on a separate monomer, linking them chemically and starting a polymer chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This single initiator then triggers a rapid chain reaction, with more and more monomers bonding together to form long polymer chains until the super glue solidifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Water as a Catalyst

The polymerization of super glue is primarily triggered by water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The slightly negative oxygen atoms in polar water molecules and the negative hydroxide ions in water initiate the breaking of the carbon double bond and the formation of polymer chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Since moisture is ubiquitous in the air, on surfaces, and absorbed into materials, super glue sets rapidly on almost every surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Each water molecule can initiate a new polymer chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

This explains why super glue sticks particularly well to skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Skin has many wrinkles and pores for the glue to seep into, and the protein collagen has negative regions that can initiate the polymerization reaction and bond directly with monomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Some skin molecules literally become part of the polymer chain, making it difficult to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Washing super glue off with soap and water can accelerate the polymerization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## Strengths and Weaknesses Related to Chemistry

Super glue polymers are linear chains densely packed with some cross-linking, making the polymer rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This rigidity provides strong compression strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Under tension, super glue is strongest when pulled in the same direction as the chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Its tensile strength can exceed 25 megapascals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

However, super glue has weaknesses:
*   **Brittleness**: It is brittle and can shatter under sudden impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The rapid reaction typically produces short polymer chains with built-in stress, creating potential failure points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Unlike flexible plastics like [[polyethylene_and_polypropylene | polyethylene]], [[polyethylene_and_polypropylene | polypropylene]], and nylons that can deform to absorb impact, super glue's rigid bonds break physically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Weakness in Shear**: Super glue is weak if a force is applied perpendicular to the polymer chains, known as shear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Shear force is unevenly distributed (highest at edges), and due to its brittleness, super glue cannot redistribute this stress, leading to bond failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Peeling**: When one end of a surface is peeled back, all force is concentrated on a few polymers, causing the chains to break one by one, like a zipper unzipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Materials It Does Not Bond To

Super glue will not bond to materials that are chemically inert, such as [[polyethylene_and_polypropylene | polyethylene]], [[polyethylene_and_polypropylene | polypropylene]], and Teflon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. These materials lack reactive sites; their carbon atoms are not sharing electrons, so there's nothing on their surface willing to donate electrons to the electron-deficient super glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Additionally, these materials are hydrophobic and non-porous, preventing water (the initiator) from effectively interacting with the glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This inertness is crucial for storing super glue without it setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Modifying Super Glue's Properties

Additives can alter the properties of pure ethyl cyanoacrylate:
*   **Thickening Agents**: Fumed silica is added to make the runny monomers into a gel, as it forms branched structures that increase viscosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Inhibitors**: Some acid is often included to inhibit polymerization while the glue is in the tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Accelerators**: To speed up setting, more negative ions (initiators) can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Accelerators can be purchased, or DIYers use baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), which reacts with moisture to produce hydroxide ions, speeding up the reaction and forming a hard composite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Layering super glue and baking soda can strengthen joints and fill gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Slowing Polymerization**: For underwater applications, gel cyanoacrylate is used; its thickeners slow the reaction, allowing time to apply and detach objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

## Medical Applications and Chemical Adjustments

Early in its [[development_and_accidental_discovery_of_super_glue | development]], the potential for [[medical_uses_and_limitations_of_super_glue | medical uses of super glue]] was recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. However, there were three key chemical problems:
1.  **Heat Release**: The formation of bonds releases heat, which can irritate a wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
2.  **Toxicity**: Over time, super glue in the body breaks down into toxic chemicals like formaldehyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
3.  **Brittleness**: Regular super glue is hard and brittle, unlike flexible living tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

These problems were solved by increasing the number of carbons in the alkyl chain of the molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Slower Reaction**: Longer carbon chains slow the binding of monomers, reducing the rate of heat release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Slower Breakdown**: Longer polymers break down much more slowly, allowing wounds to heal before toxins are released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.
*   **Increased Flexibility**: A slower reaction allows monomers more time to form longer polymers, which can absorb stress better and flex without breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

This led to the approval of medical super glues like Dermabond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

## Potential in Recycling and Sustainability

Scientists are now exploring the use of cyanoacrylate as a recyclable plastic, addressing the global plastic pollution problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Unlike other plastics that degrade with mechanical recycling, super glue can be heated to 210 degrees Celsius to break it back down into pure monomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. These monomers can then be distilled and reactivated into fresh polymer, allowing for a truly sustainable closed-loop recycling process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

Two main challenges were faced in this application:
1.  **Handleability**: The original problem of it sticking to everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. This was overcome by using modern inert plastics like [[polyethylene_and_polypropylene | polypropylene]], [[polyethylene_and_polypropylene | polyethylene]], and Teflon for handling, as they don't activate super glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
2.  **Brittleness**: To reduce brittleness for plastic applications, the goal is to form long, tangled polymer chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. This is achieved by:
    *   **Weak Base Initiator**: Using a very weak base, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), as an initiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. This provides enough initiators to start polymerization but not too many, resulting in longer polymer chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.
    *   **Solvent**: Adding a solvent, like acetone, which dilutes the conditions and provides additional mobility for the polymers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This allows for the formation of even longer, more stable chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

After setting and evaporation of the solvent, a new plastic is formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. This process yields an average of 93% monomer recovery, making it a highly efficient recycling method compared to conventional plastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

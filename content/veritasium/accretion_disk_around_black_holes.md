An accretion disk is a structure of matter that orbits a [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The [[first_image_of_a_black_hole_by_event_horizon_telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]] primarily focused on the [[supermassive_black_hole_in_m87_and_its_properties | supermassive black hole]] at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, Sagittarius A*, which possesses such an accretion disk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Properties of the Accretion Disk
The accretion disk is composed of dust and gas swirling chaotically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This matter is incredibly hot, reaching millions of degrees, and moves at a significant fraction of the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This matter serves as fuel for the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], causing it to grow larger over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO)
The accretion disk does not extend all the way to the [[photon_sphere_and_schwarzschild_radius | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This is due to the presence of an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. For matter orbiting a non-spinning [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], this orbit is located at three [[photon_sphere_and_schwarzschild_radius | Schwarzschild radii]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. If matter moves inside this orbit, it rapidly spirals into the center of the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Imaging the Accretion Disk
The appearance of the accretion disk in an image is significantly influenced by the [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | black hole's]] powerful gravity, which warps spacetime and bends light rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

*   **Viewing Angle:** If viewed perpendicular to the accretion disk, the [[first_image_of_a_black_hole_by_event_horizon_telescope | black hole image]] might appear as a fuzzy coffee mug stain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, showing a roughly symmetrical shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Edge-on View:** When observed from an edge-on or random angle to the accretion disk, the [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | warping of spacetime]] causes light from the back of the disk to bend over the top and reach our telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Similarly, light from the bottom of the disk can bend underneath the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] and come towards the observer, leading to an image resembling the [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | black hole]] depicted in the movie *Interstellar* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Multiple Images:** Light from the top of the accretion disk can orbit around the back of the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], graze the [[photon_sphere_and_schwarzschild_radius | photon sphere]], and appear as a thin ring underneath the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Conversely, light from the bottom of the disk can go underneath, around the back, and emerge over the top, creating another ring of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. If one were very close to the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], this could result in a spectacular image with multiple, thin, annular rings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Relativistic Beaming
Due to the high speeds of matter in the accretion disk, approaching the speed of light, an effect known as [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_the_black_hole | relativistic beaming]] or Doppler beaming occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This means that if a part of the disk is moving towards the observer, it will appear significantly brighter than a part moving away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This phenomenon leads to a bright spot appearing in the [[first_image_of_a_black_hole_by_event_horizon_telescope | black hole image]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Observing the accretion disk over time could reveal dynamic features like moving blobs, which could provide further insights into the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole's]] environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Disposition of Shade Balls

After conducting experiments on swimming in 10,000 shade balls, the creator faced the question of what to do with them [00:10:02].

## Patreon Initiative

It was decided that each of the 10,000 shade balls would be signed and mailed out to Patreon supporters [00:10:07]. The plan is to send a signed ball to every Patreon supporter, regardless of their location worldwide [00:10:19]. Further details regarding this initiative would be provided in the video description [00:10:30].

## Purpose of the Giveaway

This large-scale giveaway, despite the "horrendous" shipping costs, serves as a gesture of gratitude [00:10:32]. The creator stated that it is the support received on Patreon that enables them to undertake such projects [00:10:32].

The quality and safety of food and beverages are ensured through the use of standardized materials and rigorous testing processes. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) plays a crucial role by providing [[Standard Reference Materials and their Uses | Standard Reference Materials]] (SRMs) to manufacturers and researchers, which are essential for calibrating equipment and validating measurement accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

## Standard Reference Materials for Food
NIST maintains a vast collection of SRMs, including various food items, designed to ensure that reported nutritional values and contaminant levels are accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

### Peanut Butter SRM
One prominent example is the standard jar of peanut butter, which is considered one of the most expensive jars globally, costing around a thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. This high cost is not for the peanut butter itself, but for the precise knowledge of its exact composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

The process of creating this SRM involves:
*   **Homogenization** The peanut butter is mixed meticulously to ensure each jar contains an identical substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Characterization** NIST scientists spend years painstakingly identifying and quantifying all compounds within the peanut butter, including fats and various other substances, with specified uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. A certificate is provided with each SRM detailing these measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

Manufacturers and researchers purchase these SRMs to calibrate their equipment. If their instruments yield the values provided by NIST when testing the standard peanut butter, they can be confident that their equipment is working properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

### Detecting Contaminants
The accuracy of food labels is vital, but standards go beyond basic nutritional information. For instance, peanut butter can naturally contain aflatoxins, which are carcinogens produced by fungi on peanuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. Manufacturers need to accurately detect elevated levels of these toxins, which they achieve by calibrating their equipment with standard peanut butter containing known levels of aflatoxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. The FDA often encourages commercial laboratories to use SRMs for such measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Variety of Food Standards
NIST offers around 30 different food SRMs, categorizing them on a "food triangle" based on their mix of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. For a reference material to be useful, it needs to closely match the target food in composition and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Standard Trout** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>
*   **Meat Homogenate** A thoroughly mixed product of ground meats, such as chicken and pork, packed into a tin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. These mixed materials are developed in collaboration with industry companies based on their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
*   **Typical Diet SRM** This material represents the average American diet, created by blending and freeze-drying common foods. It allows for the measurement of nutritional components like sugar, proteins, and vitamins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

These SRMs ensure that when food products are tested, the results are consistent and reliable, allowing consumers to trust the information on food labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. This dedication to precision, though often unseen, underpins the safety and trustworthiness of the food we consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

A single, simple rule underpins all of physics, from [[classical mechanics]] to electromagnetism, from [[quantum theory]] to [[einsteins_general_theory_of_relativity | general relativity]], and even the fundamental particles of matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This rule, which can replace all known physical principles, is the Principle of Least Action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Brachistochrone Problem and Fermat's Principle
The journey to this unifying principle began with a simple problem: determining the shape of a ramp that would allow a mass to slide from point A to point B in the fastest possible time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This is known as the problem of fastest descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. While common sense might suggest a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, bending the ramp slightly downwards initially allows the mass to accelerate faster, reducing overall travel time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Galileo suggested the arc of a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, but Johann Bernoulli challenged the world's mathematicians in 1696 to find the true fastest path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Isaac Newton famously solved it overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, but Bernoulli's own solution was considered more creative and beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Bernoulli drew inspiration from a problem faced by ancient philosophers: how light travels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Hero of Alexandria (1st century AD) noted that in a single medium, light follows the shortest path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. However, when light refracts (bends) from one medium to another (e.g., air to water), it does not follow the shortest path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The relationship describing this bending is known as Snell's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

In 1657, Pierre Fermat proposed that light minimizes time, not distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. He showed that Snell's Law arises from this principle of least time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Fermat's Principle of Least Time was the first instance where nature was shown to obey an optimization principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Bernoulli utilized this by converting the mechanical problem of a sliding particle into an optics problem, imagining light moving through layers of varying density where its speed mimicked the acceleration of a falling object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. By applying Snell's Law to infinitesimally thin layers, he found that the optimal path was a cycloid, also known as a brachistochrone curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This curve also has the unique property that a mass released from any point on it will reach the end at the same time, earning it the name tautochrone curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## The Principle of Least Action
Around 40 years later, Pierre Louis de Maupertuis, a student of Bernoulli, sought a more fundamental quantity being minimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. In the 1740s, he proposed a new quantity called "action," defined as mass times velocity times distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Maupertuis claimed that out of all possible trajectories, the path taken by an object is the one that minimizes this action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Maupertuis' idea was initially met with ridicule and accusations of plagiarism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. However, Leonhard Euler vehemently defended it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Euler refined the principle by replacing the sum with an integral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, allowing for continuous changes in speed or direction. He also realized that the principle of least action is valid only if the total energy is conserved and is the same for all paths considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

Joseph-Louis Lagrange, a self-taught mathematician, provided a general proof for the principle around five years after Maupertuis' death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Their approach involved finding the path where a tiny variation results in no change in action, analogous to finding the minimum of a function by setting its derivative to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. This means the first-order change in action between the optimal path and any trial path is zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## Hamilton's Principle and Universal Application
The modern form of the principle, known as Hamilton's Principle, was developed by William Rowan Hamilton in 1834 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. In this formulation, action is defined as the integral of kinetic energy (T) minus potential energy (V) over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. This (T - V) quantity is called the Lagrangian (L) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. Hamilton's Principle requires a start and end point, as well as a start and end time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. Unlike Maupertuis' principle, energies can differ, but time must be consistent between paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

When [[applications_of_calculus_in_physics | applying this mathematical framework]] to a simple example, such as a ball thrown straight up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>, it leads directly to Newton's Second Law of motion (F=ma) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. This demonstrates that the Principle of Least Action is equivalent to, but more expansive than, Newton's laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. Fermat's principle of least time is revealed to be a special case of this broader principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.

### The Power of the Lagrangian Approach
While seemingly more complex than Newton's Second Law, the Lagrangian approach offers significant advantages in [[classical mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. By simply defining the kinetic and potential energies, complex equations of motion can be derived by plugging them into the Euler-Lagrange equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. This method simplifies problems, especially those involving multiple dimensions or complex coordinate systems (like polar coordinates for rotating systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>. For instance, solving the motion of a double pendulum using forces is extremely difficult, but becomes straightforward with the Lagrangian approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

### Stationary Action
It is important to note that "least action" can be a misleading name. More accurately, it is the principle of *stationary* action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. Setting a derivative to zero in [[applications_of_calculus_in_physics | calculus]] can yield a minimum, maximum, or saddle point. Similarly, the laws of motion derive from demanding a stationary point of the action, meaning the first-order change in action is zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. While it is very often a true minimum, it is not always the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.

### Broader Implications
The Principle of Least Action proved to be far more fundamental than just [[classical mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. Around the turn of the 20th century, "action" emerged as a key component in the solution to major problems in atomic physics, such as the UV catastrophe, marking a crucial step towards the development of [[quantum theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.

The story of the Principle of Least Action is a testament to how knowledge compounds through [[history of physics and mathematics discoveries | steady progress]], ultimately changing our understanding of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. What were once viewed as entirely separate fields of physics were unified under this single, simple rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. The variation of the action is zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

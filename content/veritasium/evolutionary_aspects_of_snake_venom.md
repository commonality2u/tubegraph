Snake venom is a complex biological tool that has evolved significantly over millions of years. It plays a crucial role in the survival of snakes, primarily serving as a means for prey capture and digestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Each snake species possesses a unique venom composition, specifically adapted to target the animals it typically hunts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Origin and Purpose

Venom is believed to have [[evolutionary biology and cooperation | evolved]] from saliva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Its effectiveness against humans is due to our shared [[evolutionary biology and cooperation | evolutionary history]] with rodents, which are a primary prey for many snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Rodents and primates diverged on the [[evolutionary biology and cooperation | evolutionary tree]] approximately 75 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, meaning we share many fundamental biological processes, such as cell structure, blood clotting mechanisms, and nerve signaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Snake venoms often target highly conserved molecular pathways found across vertebrates, and sometimes even across the entire tree of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## Evolution of Fangs

The mechanism for venom delivery has also undergone significant [[evolutionary biology and cooperation | evolutionary changes]]:
*   **Rear-Fanged Ancestors** Initially, venom was squirted into a snake's mouth by the back teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Even today, nearly two-thirds of all snakes are rear-fanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This configuration is due to the venom gland being located behind the snake's eye, making the shortest duct pathway directly downwards to the back of the upper jaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Forward Migration** [[evolutionary biology and cooperation | Evolutionary pressures]] led to the fangs moving closer to the front of the jaw in some species, enhancing the snake's efficiency in catching and killing prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Grooved and Hollow Fangs** Fangs began as smooth, ordinary teeth with venom flowing externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Over time, some snake lineages [[evolutionary biology and cooperation | evolved]] a groove in each fang to channel the venom more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This groove gradually deepened, eventually closing to form a hollow tube, allowing for direct venom injection into prey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, hollow fangs are not the norm, present in only one-seventh of the world's snake species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Notably, almost all venomous snakes in Australia possess hollow fangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Venom Composition and Effects

Snake venoms are complex cocktails, often containing up to 200 different compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. These compounds can have various effects:
*   **Neurotoxic** Damages the nervous system and brain by interfering with neurotransmitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Hemotoxic** Thins blood, prevents wound healing, and causes internal bleeding by disrupting blood coagulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Cytotoxic** Attacks cells, leading to severe blisters, necrosis, and cell death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Myotoxic** Destroys muscles and can cause paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

Most venoms are a combination of these types of proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, making snake bites challenging to treat because multiple toxins work in concert to inflict harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Measuring Venom Potency

The concept of the "most venomous snake" is complex because venoms [[evolutionary biology and cooperation | evolved]] for potency against specific prey, and prey in turn [[evolutionary biology and cooperation | evolved]] resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. For example, the honey badger is nearly immune to Cobra venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Scientists typically assess lethality by testing different venoms on lab mice, providing an estimate of the [[snake_venom_and_human_safety | amount of antivenom]] needed to neutralize a bite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. A 1979 study, for instance, determined that one bite from a King Cobra contains enough venom to kill 13,000 mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, which can be estimated to kill about four human-sized rodents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. By this measure, the Inland Taipan, found in Australia, is considered the most venomous land snake in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. A single bite from an Inland Taipan contains enough venom to kill half a million mice, or over 100 humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Some facilities, like the Australian Reptile Park, selectively breed snakes to produce more venom than their wild counterparts for antivenom production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Coastal Taipans bred there can produce five to seven times the venom of their wild counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, resulting in "super snakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

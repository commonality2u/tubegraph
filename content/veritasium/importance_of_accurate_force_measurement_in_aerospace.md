Measuring incredibly large forces, such as the 570,000 newtons of thrust from a world-record jet engine or the 33,360,000 newtons from the Saturn V rocket that launched people to the moon, requires extreme accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This precision is critical for ensuring the safety and performance of aerospace vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## The World's Largest Force Calibration Machine

At the forefront of [[measurement_of_large_forces | large force measurement]] is a dead weight machine managed by physical scientist Rick Seifarth, capable of applying 4,448,222 newtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, which is exactly equal to 1,000,000 pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This machine contains twenty 50,000-pound increments, cumulatively reaching 4.45 meganewtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It is believed to house the largest mass objects ever calibrated anywhere in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Another, even larger machine of its type, is capable of 13.3 meganewtons or three million pounds of force, making it the biggest in the world and one-of-a-kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## How Force Sensors are Calibrated

Below ground, 20 carefully calibrated masses are housed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Their weight is used to [[calibrating_force_sensors_and_transducers | calibrate force sensors]], also known as force transducers, in the lab upstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The process for [[calibrating_force_sensors_and_transducers | calibrating force sensors]] involves:
1.  Placing a force transducer on a compression head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  A hydraulic ram in the attic raises a green lifting frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
3.  As the force transducer contacts a red loading frame, it begins lifting the weights downstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
4.  As the lifting frame continues to rise, more of the 50,000-pound weights become suspended by the force sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
5.  Since the weights create an accurately known force, the readouts from the force transducer can be precisely calibrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

These calibrated devices are then sent out into the field, embedded in test stands to monitor forces during rocket firings, ensuring, for example, that a rocket is operating at a precise "104% of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Precision and Traceability in Force Measurement

The precision required for these measurements is astounding. Each 50,000-pound mass, equivalent to ten minivans, has its exact value known to within several American nickels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This minute uncertainty is measured with respect to the very definition of the kilogram, using K20, the United States fundamental [[mass_and_force_calibration_methods | mass standard]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

This is achieved through a meticulous [[mass_and_force_calibration_methods | mass and force calibration method]] that involves comparing combinations of known weights, starting with K20, with larger unknown weights, gradually working up to larger and larger masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. For instance, a 5-kilogram mass is compared to combinations of 2s and 1s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The process then converts to pounds, escalating from 50-pound masses to 500 pounds, then 2500 pounds, and finally to 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 pounds using a floor scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Combinations of these huge weights are then used to calibrate the 50,000-pound masses that form the dead weight machine's stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

The vertical force generated by these weights is guaranteed with an uncertainty of 0.0005%, or five parts per million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This means at the full one million pounds of applied force, the accuracy is within five pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Factors Affecting Accuracy

Achieving such precision requires accounting for several factors:
*   **Gravitational Acceleration** The gravitational acceleration at the machine's location is slightly less than Earth's standard gravity, necessitating an additional 600 pounds to be added to the weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Buoyant Force** The masses displace 125 pounds of air, creating a buoyant force that must be counteracted. An additional 125 pounds must be added to reach a true million pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. These [[gravity_and_buoyancy_effects_on_largescale_mass_measurements | gravity and buoyancy effects on large-scale mass measurements]] are crucial for precise calibration.

## The Importance of Physical Testing

The existence of such a precise calibration machine underscores the critical need for physical testing over theoretical generalization. An axiom in the field states that "one physical test is worth a thousand expert opinions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This principle is particularly vital in physical testing environments like aerospace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. When boarding an airplane, passengers expect the forces involved in its construction and operation to be measured with negligible uncertainty, rather than an acceptable 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

Some individuals are consistently more prone to mosquito bites than others, a phenomenon science has shown to be influenced, at least partially, by genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Research, including studies involving genetic testing companies like 23andMe, has identified specific locations on human DNA that correlate with an individual's attractiveness to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Mosquito Biology and Attraction Testing

Only female mosquitoes bite, as they require blood proteins to produce their eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The mosquito lifecycle, from egg to adult, takes approximately two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Adult mosquitoes then seek out vertebrate blood to perpetuate their reproductive cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

To study mosquito attraction, scientists use a "Y-tube" apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. In this setup, mosquitoes are released into a holding chamber with a fan creating a draft, leading to two arms of the Y-tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. One arm contains a "bait" (e.g., a human hand), while the other serves as a control or contains a different bait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Researchers count how many mosquitoes choose each arm to determine attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Evidence for Genetic Influence

The Y-tube test has been instrumental in demonstrating the genetic basis of mosquito attractiveness. A study involving 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of fraternal (non-identical) female twins used this test to evaluate individual attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Twin Study Findings
> Scientists found that mosquito attractiveness was correlated between twins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This correlation was significantly higher for identical twins, who share more of the same genes, compared to fraternal twins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This strong correlation in identical twins provides compelling evidence that genetics influence how attractive a person is to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### 23andMe Research and Personal Genetic Results

A 2017 study, conducted in collaboration with 23andMe, further explored the genetic links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Over 16,000 individuals opted into this research, rating their perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Through a genome-wide association study, researchers analyzed the DNA of participants to identify commonalities among those who reported being more attractive to mosquitoes versus those who were not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This led to the identification of seven specific DNA locations, involving single letter changes, that were associated with varying levels of mosquito attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Analysis of personal genetic results between a frequently bitten individual (Derek) and his less-bitten wife (Raquel) revealed consistent findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>:
*   Out of the seven identified genetic locations, they had identical DNA at four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   At one differing location, Raquel possessed a letter change associated with significantly *decreased* attractiveness to mosquitoes (a protective effect) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   At a second differing location, Derek had a letter change associated with *decreased* attractiveness, though less significant than Raquel's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   At the third differing location, Derek had two copies of a variant associated with *increased* attractiveness to mosquitoes, while Raquel had none <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Overall, their genetic profiles aligned with their anecdotal experiences of mosquito attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Attraction

The exact mechanisms by which these genetic variations influence mosquito attraction are not fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. However, it is likely related to the volatile chemicals and odors produced by the human body, potentially influenced by the skin's microbiome (bacteria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Mosquitoes are primarily attracted to [[chemical_signals_affecting_mosquito_behavior | carbon dioxide]] emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Factors that increase carbon dioxide output, such as a higher metabolism, recent exercise, larger body size, or pregnancy, can make an individual more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Other [[chemical_signals_affecting_mosquito_behavior | volatile chemicals]] that attract mosquitoes include lactic acid, acetone, and ammonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Conversely, some naturally occurring chemicals, such as octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, appear to repel mosquitoes or impair their ability to locate a host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Significance and Evolutionary Aspects

The hereditary nature of mosquito attractiveness is estimated to be comparable to that of height or IQ, indicating a significant genetic role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Understanding this relationship is crucial given that [[mosquitoes_and_their_impact_on_human_health | mosquitoes have the greatest impact on human health]] of all animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. They are considered the most dangerous animal globally, with mosquito-borne illnesses leading to over a million deaths annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

An intriguing [[role_of_evolution_in_human_attractiveness_to_mosquitoes | evolutionary adaptation]] highlights this danger: the malaria parasite, once contracted by a human, actually alters the host's body chemistry to produce an odor that makes them more attractive to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This facilitates the parasite's transmission via the mosquito vector, demonstrating the remarkable evolutionary strategies at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

Evidence for [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter | dark matter]] also comes from the oldest light in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This light, known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), originated approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when light was finally able to travel unimpeded through the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Temperature Fluctuations in the CMB

The CMB image displays subtle temperature differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>:
*   Red spots indicate areas of the early universe that were slightly hotter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   Blue spots indicate areas that were a little cooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
These temperature differences were very small, only about 0.01% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Analyzing CMB "Blobs"

Scientists can convert this CMB picture into a graph by counting the number of "blobs" (areas of similar temperature) of different sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This process reveals:
*   A "peak" representing the most common size blob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   Additional "peaks" of decreasing size, corresponding to other common blob sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Dark Matter's Influence on CMB Peaks

The height of these peaks is directly influenced by the amount of [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter | dark matter]] present in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   In a universe without [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter | dark matter]], the graph of blob sizes would look different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   As the amount of [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter | dark matter]] increases, the amplitudes of the even-numbered peaks in the graph decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

To accurately match the measurements of the CMB, models require the presence of approximately five times as much [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter | dark matter]] as ordinary matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This finding consistently aligns with the amount of [[dark_matter_interaction_with_ordinary_matter | dark matter]] needed to explain the observed motion of stars within galaxies and the movement of galaxies within clusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

The [[history_of_dark_matter_hypothesis | dark matter hypothesis]] offers a simple theoretical framework that explains a wide range of different astronomical observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. It posits the existence of a particle that primarily interacts only through gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

The Navy's Indoor Ocean, located at Carderock, is the largest [[wave_pool_technology_and_design | wave pool]] in the world [00:00:04]. This facility is designed to test [[testing_scale_ship_models | scale ship models]] and refine their designs before actual deployment on the open ocean [00:00:09], serving as a crucial tool for [[applications_in_naval_engineering | applications in naval engineering]] [00:06:52]. Upon entering, visitors are struck by its resemblance to a real ocean, including the water's color, rather than a typical swimming pool [00:00:24].

## Facility Dimensions

The indoor ocean is immense, measuring 360 feet long in one dimension and 240 feet long in the other [00:00:34]. It is 20 feet deep [00:00:39], approximately the size of a football field [00:00:40]. The dome covering the facility was, for a period, the largest free-standing dome globally [00:00:42].

## Wave Generation and Control

The pool can generate waves of various shapes and sizes using 216 individual wave makers, which are huge paddles lining two of the pool's walls [00:00:50]. These wave makers can create waves with angles ranging from -45 degrees up to 135 degrees [00:01:00]. The paddles are meticulously programmed to move in a highly choreographed manner, enabling the production of perfectly sized and frequency-controlled waves that are reproducible across the entire pool [00:01:17]. The angular motion of the paddles is facilitated by air bellows, and force transducers measure the forces involved [00:01:27].

What truly distinguishes this facility from other wave pools is its unparalleled control [00:01:39]. Engineers can repeatedly create waves of a specific amplitude and frequency [00:01:42]. For example, the largest wave that can be made at one Hertz is determined by the motion and power requirements of the wave makers [00:01:59].

## [[wave_dynamics_and_properties | Wave Dynamics and Properties]]

The indoor ocean is an ideal environment for observing the fundamental [[wave_dynamics_and_properties | properties of waves]] [00:03:06].

*   **Energy Transmission**: Waves primarily transmit energy rather than material from one place to another [00:02:25].
*   **Water Molecule Movement**: As a wave travels, water molecules typically move along circular paths [00:02:33]. The deeper the water, the smaller this motion becomes [00:02:38].
*   **Wave Base**: All water motion caused by a wave ceases at a depth equal to half its wavelength; this is known as the wave base [00:02:41].
*   **Wave Drift**: Even in ideal conditions, water molecules drift slightly in the direction of wave motion [00:02:51]. This occurs because molecules travel faster at the top of their circular loop than they move backward at the bottom, resulting in a spiral path [00:02:55].
*   **Frequency and Speed**: The frequency of a wave affects its speed [00:03:43]. Higher frequency waves generally travel slower than low frequency waves [00:03:48]. As long as the water is deeper than the wave base, wave speed is inversely proportional to its frequency [00:03:51].

### Wave Demonstrations

The facility can perform various wave demonstrations:

*   **Combined Frequencies**: High frequency waves are sent out first, followed by progressively lower frequency waves [00:04:06]. Due to their slower travel speed, the high frequency waves are eventually caught up by the faster, lower frequency waves [00:04:13].
*   **Wave Breaking**: By precisely timing the release of waves, all the waves can be made to converge at the same time and place in the pool, causing a wave to break [00:04:23]. This can be replicated consistently due to the precise control over wave generation [00:04:38].
*   **Superposition Principle**: When waves meet, they add together [00:04:45]. The resulting water height is the sum of the heights of the individual waves at that point [00:04:50]. This principle allows for the creation of large breaking waves from individually small waves [00:04:59].
*   **Standing Waves**: The superposition principle can also be used to create standing waves, where two regular waves travel towards each other [00:05:07]. At certain points in the pool, waves will consistently cancel out to zero amplitude, while at others, they will combine for maximum amplitude, creating a "quilt pattern" effect [00:05:26].
*   **Bullseye Wave**: Waves can be sent from all directions to form circular wave fronts that channel all their energy into a single focal point, referred to as the "bullseye" [00:05:36]. This phenomenon causes the wave to break when its height exceeds one-seventh of its wavelength [00:06:04]. Objects placed in the water, such as a rubber ducky, will drift with the waves and be funneled into this breaking point [00:06:19].

## [[applications_in_naval_engineering | Applications in Naval Engineering]]

The primary purpose of the facility is to replicate ocean conditions on a smaller scale to test how Navy ships behave [00:06:47]. Researchers place [[testing_scale_ship_models | scale ship models]] (which are models of vessels costing billions of dollars) in the water to observe their behavior under various simulated real-world conditions [00:07:00].

*   **Scaling and Buoyancy**: When conducting tests, factors like water salinity are considered. The pool uses fresh water [00:07:38], so models must be ballasted to account for the increased buoyancy found in salty ocean water, ensuring the model's behavior accurately reflects full-scale conditions [00:07:43]. This is part of how [[gravity_and_buoyancy_effects_on_largescale_mass_measurements | gravity and buoyancy effects on large-scale mass measurements]] are factored into testing.
*   **Froude Number Scaling**: For fluid mechanics, while the Reynolds number is typically conserved, for accurate wave dynamics, a different scaling based on the Froude number is used [00:07:54]. The Froude number represents the ratio of inertial to gravitational forces [00:08:08]. If a model ship's hull is 46 times smaller than the real vessel, it must travel at one over the square root of 46 times its real-world speed to achieve accurate data [00:08:22]. To make footage from the model match a full-sized ship, it must be slowed down by a factor of approximately 6.8 (the square root of 46) [00:08:34]. This precise scaling ensures the physics of the model's interaction with waves are identical to a real ship at sea [00:08:51].
*   **Model Testing Methods**: Models can be free-running on a pre-programmed track (like a racetrack or figure eight) to correlate headings to full-scale vessels [00:07:17]. Alternatively, models can be tethered to a carriage [00:16:27], which tows them across the waves, allowing for power and instrumentation to be supplied to models that cannot carry it themselves [00:16:29].
*   **Sensor Array**: A large array of ultrasonic sensors is used to measure wave height, period, and direction within the basin, ensuring that tested conditions match intended specifications [00:09:53].

### Real-World Conditions and Ship Design

The pool can simulate diverse wave conditions found across the world's oceans [00:10:06]. Most ocean waves are generated by wind, with the strongest waves occurring in and around storms [00:10:13]. Five factors influence the size and shape of wind-generated waves: wind speed, wind duration, fetch (the distance over which wind acts), fetch width, and water depth [00:10:20].

*   **Swell vs. Wind Waves**: As waves travel away from a storm, higher frequency waves dissipate their energy more quickly [00:10:37]. Consequently, the waves that travel long distances are the fast-moving, low frequency waves known as swell [00:10:42]. Swell, despite being noticeable at beaches (e.g., waves crashing 10 seconds apart on a calm day [00:11:44]), is generally not a concern for ships in the open ocean, which are more affected by steep, windy waves [00:11:52]. The analogy between sound frequencies and wave frequencies holds: just as low-frequency bass sounds travel further than high-frequency sounds from a concert, low-frequency swell travels further than high-frequency wind waves [00:11:04].
*   **Rogue Waves**: So-called "rogue waves" are not spontaneous occurrences but typically result from multiple waves meeting and combining their amplitudes to create a much larger wave than a single wave would produce [00:11:24]. When such a large wave reaches a point where its amplitude is too great to hold, it breaks [00:11:36].
*   **Formation of Wind Waves**: Wind waves form in three steps:
    1.  Turbulent wind creates tiny ripples (around one centimeter wavelength) on still water due to slight pressure differences [00:12:06].
    2.  The wind then acts on these ripples, creating larger pressure differences between the front and top of the wave crest, pulling them into bigger waves [00:12:23].
    3.  This interaction between wind and waves leads to even greater pressure differences and larger waves [00:12:33]. As waves interact, they develop a range of wavelengths [00:12:43]. When wind continues to blow, these waves begin breaking, dissipating their kinetic energy as heat through swirling eddies [00:12:48]. Once energy dissipation equals energy input from the wind, the waves reach their maximum size, known as a fully developed sea [00:12:57].
*   **Irregular Waves (Spectra)**: Unlike the regular waves with a single frequency and amplitude, irregular waves, or "spectra," consist of multiple frequencies and amplitudes [00:13:09]. Different oceans have unique mixtures of wave frequencies (spectra) based on their geography and storm patterns [00:13:37]. For example, the North Sea has a "peakier spectrum" due to limited storm fetch [00:13:49], the mid-Atlantic has a broader spectrum for developing or decaying open ocean waves [00:13:58], and the North Atlantic, with steady winds over open ocean, produces the broadest spectrum of wind waves [00:14:06]. Engineers first determine a ship's deployment location and the corresponding wave spectra before recreating them in the pool for testing [00:14:13].
*   **Ship Design Innovation**: The facility is crucial for innovation in ship design [00:16:53]. Every ship in the Navy's fleet has undergone testing or review at this facility [00:17:11]. New designs, such as ships with a "tumble home" hull (shaped opposite to a traditional flared hull), are tested here [00:17:22]. While a flare provides a restoring force when a ship rolls [00:17:27], a tumble home design has less restoring force but may offer advantages in "above water signatures," such as reduced radar cross-sections for stealth [00:17:45]. The constant pursuit of stealthier, faster, and more powerful ships drives these innovations [00:17:55].
*   **Operational Impact**: The work performed at the Navy's Indoor Ocean significantly impacts every ship and submarine in the fleet, even if many sailors are unaware of the extensive background research and testing [00:18:04]. Testing helps identify potential issues, such as excessive water washing onto the deck during rough seas, which is critical for operations like helicopter landings [00:15:33]. The engineers here can simulate conditions so severe that a full-sized ship could experience mattresses sliding off beds due to violent motion [00:15:08].

While engineers enjoy the scientific aspects of the facility, the pool is not for public swimming [00:09:01]. No one is permitted in the pool when waves are active due to safety concerns [00:09:24].

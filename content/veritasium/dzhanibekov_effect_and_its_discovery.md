The **Dzhanibekov effect** is also known as the tennis racket theorem or the [[unique_phenomena_in_zerogravity_settings_such_as_the_intermediate_axis_theorem | intermediate axis theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It describes a strange and counterintuitive phenomenon of rotating objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Discovery and Secrecy

In 1985, cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov was tasked with saving the Soviet space station Salyut 7, which had completely shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. After rescuing the space station, Dzhanibekov unpacked supplies and noticed something strange as a wing-nut spun off a bolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The wing-nut maintained its orientation for a short time, then flipped 180 degrees, and continued flipping back and forth at regular intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This motion occurred without any applied forces or torques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This phenomenon was kept secret by the Russians for 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## The Tennis Racket Theorem

Six years after Dzhanibekov's observation, in 1991, a paper titled "The Twisting Tennis Racket" was published in the *Journal of Dynamics and Differential Equations* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Although related, this paper made no mention of the secret Dzhanibekov effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. It described how flipping a tennis racket in the air, when held facing you, not only rotates as intended but also makes a half-turn around an axis that passes through its handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Principal Axes and Moment of Inertia

To understand this effect, it's necessary to consider an object's three principal axes of rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. For a tennis racket:
*   **First axis:** Runs through the handle (easiest to spin around, smallest moment of inertia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Its mass is distributed closest to this axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Third axis:** Runs perpendicular to the head of the racket (hardest to spin around, greatest moment of inertia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Its mass is distributed as far as possible from this axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Second axis (intermediate axis):** Runs parallel to the head of the racket (intermediate moment of inertia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Spins about the first and third axes are stable, with no rotation occurring about other axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. However, rotating about the intermediate (second) axis results in the characteristic half-twist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This phenomenon isn't exclusive to tennis rackets; it can be observed with cell phones and discs with holes in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

The intermediate axis effect requires an object to have three different moments of inertia about its three principal axes, making it an "asymmetric top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Objects with only two different moments of inertia (like a spinning ring) or one moment of inertia (like anything with spherical symmetry) will not demonstrate the theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Although the 1991 paper claimed the phenomenon was new, an understanding of the [[unique_phenomena_in_zerogravity_settings_such_as_the_intermediate_axis_theorem | intermediate axis theorem]] dates back at least 150 years to Louis Poinsot's book, *The New Theory of Rotating Bodies* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. In microgravity, the effects are more striking than with a tennis racket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. While simulations and animations exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, the mathematics behind it are complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Physicist Richard Feynman famously stated there was no intuitive way to understand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Intuitive Explanation (Terry Tao's Model)

An intuitive explanation of the [[unique_phenomena_in_zerogravity_settings_such_as_the_intermediate_axis_theorem | intermediate axis theorem]] was provided by mathematician Terry Tao in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. His explanation involves a thin, rigid, massless disc with:
*   Heavy point masses on opposite edges of the x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Light point masses on opposite edges of the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

This setup creates an object with three different moments of inertia:
*   **Smallest:** Rotating around the x-axis (only light masses move) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Greatest:** Rotating about the z-axis (all four masses move) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Intermediate:** Rotating about the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

When rotating about the y-axis, centripetal forces on the big masses keep them in uniform circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. In a rotating reference frame, centrifugal forces appear, pushing masses away from the rotation axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. If the disc is bumped slightly off the y-axis, the small masses experience centrifugal forces proportional to their distance from the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Tension forces within the disc ensure the small masses remain orthogonal to the big masses, which are constrained by their inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. These centrifugal forces accelerate the small masses, making them move further from the y-axis, until they flip onto opposite sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. During the first half of the flip, forces accelerate the masses; in the second half, they slow them down, causing them to essentially come to rest on the opposite side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This pattern then repeats indefinitely, with the disc flipping back and forth at regular intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

## Earth-Flipping Hypothesis

The secrecy surrounding the Dzhanibekov effect might have stemmed from what Dzhanibekov did after his observation: he attached modeling clay to the wing-nut and found it also flipped periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This led to speculation that if Earth is a spinning ball in space, it too could flip over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Given past reversals of Earth's magnetic poles, some wondered if there was a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. In 2012, fueled by Mayan prophecies, speculation about the Dzhanibekov effect and a potential Earth flip became popular among conspiracy theorists and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The official Russian federal space agency, RusCosmos, even posted an article on May 13, 2012, stating that "the spinning nut of Dzhanibekov caused astonishment and simultaneous danger to a certain part of the scientific world" and that a "hypothesis was proposed that our planet, in the course of its orbital motion, can execute the same overturn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Validity of the Hypothesis

Astronaut Don Pettit performed [[experimental_demonstrations_in_physics | experiments]] aboard the space station that provide clues about the Earth-flipping hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. He showed that:
*   A solid book or cylinder spins stably about its first or third axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   A liquid-filled cylinder spinning about its first axis (smallest moment of inertia) is unstable and will end up rotating about its axis with the largest moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

While an isolated object spinning in space maintains constant angular momentum, its kinetic energy can be converted into other forms, such as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. When a liquid sloshes inside, energy is dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Spinning about the axis with the smallest moment of inertia also means spinning with the greatest kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. As kinetic energy is dissipated, the cylinder will shift to spin about the axis that achieves the minimum kinetic energy, which is the one with the largest moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. For a given angular momentum, rotating with the maximum moment of inertia is the lowest energy state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. All bodies will tend towards this state if they have any way of dissipating their energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

The U.S. learned this with their first satellite, Explorer One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Designed to spin stably about its long axis, it was rotating end-over-end within hours of achieving orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Its flexible antennas allowed the satellite to dissipate energy by swinging back and forth, reducing its kinetic energy until it rotated about the axis that maximized its moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

Earth is similar: it has ways of dissipating energy internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Over time, it has come to spin about the axis with the maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Most astronomical objects do the same; for example, Mars's Tharsis Rise mass concentration is located at its equator, which positions it as far as possible from the rotation axis, ensuring Mars rotates with its maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Most asteroids also spin around the axis with their maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Therefore, the Earth will not flip; it is stably spinning about the axis with its maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

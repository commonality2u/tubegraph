Relativity Space, a startup, has built the world's largest 3D metal printer, aiming to [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | print]] an entire rocket, including fuel tanks and rocket engines, in just 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This represents a significant shift in [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | aerospace engineering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## How 3D Printing Works

Relativity Space's large 3D printer, named Stargate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, uses a wire melt team and a print head that moves around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It employs plasma discharge and changes the electric waveform every couple of milliseconds to control deposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The process melts an aluminum alloy wire, similar to a spider silk, at just above its melting point (660 degrees Celsius), likely a few hundred degrees above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This wire is printed at about 10 inches per second, with lasers and plasma arc discharge melting both together simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

For smaller, complex parts like rocket nozzles, metal powder and lasers are typically used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This method lays down extremely fine layers, about a 20th the thickness of a human hair, relentlessly for about a week until the part is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Benefits of 3D Printed Rockets

### Speed of Production and Reduced Development Time
Unlike traditional manufacturing, where tools must be built before the rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, 3D printing significantly accelerates the process. For instance, NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) required 11 years of development to get one assembled on the pad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. In contrast, Relativity Space, in just five and a half years, plans to launch its first rocket within the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. An entire engine can be built in about a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

### Reduced Part Count
One of the most significant benefits of [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printing]] is the drastic reduction in the number of parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. A rocket engine injector, which traditionally consists of over a thousand individual pieces and takes nine months to build, can be [[comparison_between_traditional_and_3d_printed_rocket_production | 3D printed]] as a single piece in two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Similarly, rocket nozzles with internal cooling channels for cryogenic propellants, which used to require brazing thousands of small pipes together, can now be printed as one integrated part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. A fully [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printed]] rocket can have a hundred times fewer parts than a traditionally built one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Cost Efficiency
The reduction in parts and manufacturing time also leads to significant cost savings. The 3D printed injector, for example, costs 10 times less than its traditionally manufactured counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Overall, 3D printed rockets are currently about five times cheaper than traditional rockets, with a potential to reach 10 to 100 times cheaper with fully reusable designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

### Enhanced Material Properties
Counterintuitively, [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printed]] metals can be stronger than traditionally built ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This is achieved by developing custom alloys in-house and taking advantage of the rapid melting, cooling, and solidification physics principles during the printing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Rapid Iteration and Design Flexibility
[[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printing]] allows for rapid iteration: parts can be built quickly, tested, redesigned, and printed again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This "software-driven manufacturing" means part geometries are controlled via CAD models, allowing for extremely fast design changes since there's no fixed tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Novel Designs and Automation
[[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printing]] enables engineers to create complex, smooth, curvy, and even bio-inspired designs that would be impractical or impossible with traditional techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. These designs are often the optimal structures for the rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Furthermore, [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printing]] inherently brings automation to [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | aerospace engineering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Unlike traditional aerospace factories that rely on manual assembly of millions of parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, 3D printers assemble components in the digital file before printing them as an assembled whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Challenges of 3D Printed Rockets

### Technical Difficulties
Early on, Relativity Space encountered challenges, with initial attempts resulting in "a pile of metal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. A significant hurdle is managing material warping as it cools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Relativity Space developed software that "reverse warps" the part before printing, ensuring it comes out perfectly straight within a human hair's width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Surface Roughness
While a 3D printed rocket still shows visible layers, adding 5-10% to its mass, this surface roughness does not cause any aerodynamic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. When cross-sectioned, the material looks like normal metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Market Adoption and Scale
A key issue for [[3d_printing_in_aerospace_engineering | aerospace]] is that not many rockets are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. This lack of high-volume production means there's historically been less incentive to fully automate factories to "pump out rockets like a hundred a day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. While [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printing]] is automation for aerospace, some question if rockets will always be 3D printed if flight volumes increase significantly, as dedicated machines might become cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## Future Vision

Relativity Space's long-term vision is to shrink their "factory of the future" to launch to Mars and build an industrial base there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Their first rocket, Terran One, is primarily for low Earth orbit, but Terran R is designed to send payloads to the Moon and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The founder believes that dozens or hundreds of companies are needed to make Mars colonization happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite initial [[personal_experience_in_experimental_craft | frustrations]] with [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printing]] technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, companies like Relativity Space have demonstrated that there are compelling reasons to [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D print]] rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. By pioneering the application of [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printing]] to entire rocket structures, Relativity Space has become a world expert in [[impact_of_3d_printing_on_rocket_design_and_manufacturing | 3D printing]] rocket hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. This approach aims to dramatically lower costs and enable future [[future_prospects_of_3d_printing_in_space_exploration | space exploration]] goals like Mars colonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

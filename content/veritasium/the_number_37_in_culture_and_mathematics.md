The number 37 holds a unique place in human perception and mathematical properties, often chosen when people are asked to pick a "random" number. This phenomenon highlights how humans are "really bad at selecting things randomly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## The Psychology of Number Selection

Studies show that when people are asked to pick a random number between 1 and 100, 37 is a frequently chosen number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This behavior is considered the numerical equivalent of the [[the_psychology_of_numbers | blue-seven phenomenon]], where people reliably select blue and 7 most often when asked to pick a color and a number across various cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Initial observations and anecdotal evidence showed 37 to be a common choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. When specifically asked for a two-digit number, 37 was found to be the most common answer, even to the surprise of researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Surveys on Random Number Selection

While it has "long been suggested" that 37 is the equivalent of the blue-seven phenomenon for numbers 1 to 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, formal polls were historically lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   A Reddit poll of 1,380 people found 69 as the most popular number, followed by 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   A large-scale survey involving 200,000 responses to a community post asking for a random number between 1 and 100 demonstrated consistent, non-random distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
    *   Ignoring extremes (1, 100) and culturally significant numbers (42, 69), the numbers that stood out as feeling "more random" were 7, 73, 77, and 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   A follow-up question asked people to pick the number they thought the fewest others would pick, aiming for truly random selections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
    *   The results were clearer, with 73 and 37 being the most selected, nearly tied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
    *   Multiples of 10 (like 90, 30, 40, 70, 80, 60) were the least picked, suggesting they don't seem random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   The most picked overall numbers, excluding outliers, were 73 and 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Ironically, this evidence suggests 37 and its inversion, 73, are "not being random at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Perceived Randomness
People tend to perceive 37 as random because it doesn't feel "contrived" or "too central" like 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This perception is influenced by several factors:
*   **Odd Numbers:** Even numbers are generally perceived as less random than odd numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Digit Preference:** Numbers ending in 5 or 9 are considered less random, and extremes like 1 and 9 are also avoided, leading people towards digits 3 and 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. All top numbers in the survey consisted of 3s and 7s, which were also the most selected digits in both questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Cultural Appearances and Beliefs
*   **Magic Trick:** There is a widespread professional magic trick called "The 37 Force" that relies on an audience member picking 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Hacker Slang:** In the famous Stanford MIT Jargon File, 37 is listed as the random number of choice for computer programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Collector:** One individual has been collecting instances of the number 37 since 1981, beginning with a comedy routine by Charles Fleischer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Fleischer's routine highlighted "coincidences" like 37 holes in a telephone speaker, Shakespeare writing 37 plays, and 37 movements in Beethoven's Nine Symphonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This collector even built a website dedicated to 37 in 1994, which receives contributions from people worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

## Mathematical Significance

Beyond cultural perceptions, 37 holds several interesting mathematical properties.

### Primes and Randomness
Prime numbers, like 37, are often perceived as random because:
1.  **Infrequent Appearance:** They don't appear as much in everyday life (e.g., pixel counts, fruit boxes, square footage) where composite numbers are more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
2.  **No Formula:** There is no known simple formula to find the next prime number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The closest approximation is the [[the_prime_number_phenomenon | Prime Number Theorem]], which states that the nth prime number occurs approximately at n times the natural log of n, but this is not exact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This lack of a formula contributes to their "random" occurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### The Median Second Prime Factor
Surprisingly, 37 is the median second prime factor of all numbers from 1 to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This means that half of all numbers have a second prime factor of 37 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Calculating Second Prime Factor Distribution
> *   The prime factor 3 is the second prime factor for numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 (i.e., divisible by 6), which is 1/6 of all numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
> *   The prime factor 5 is the second prime factor for 1/10 of all numbers. This is calculated by considering numbers divisible by 5 and 3 but not 2 (1/30 of numbers) or by 5 and 2 but not 3 (1/15 of numbers), summing to 1/10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
> *   Continuing this process for primes like 7, the running total quickly approaches a balancing point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, which is 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Other Prime Qualities
37 possesses several classifications as a prime number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>:
*   Irregular prime
*   Cuban prime
*   Lucky prime
*   Sexy prime
*   Permutable prime
*   Padovan prime

### Divisibility Trick
There's a mathematical trick where if you take a number that is a multiple of 37 squared (1369), reverse it, and stick a 0 between every digit, the resulting number is a multiple of 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. There are also tricks for determining if a six-digit number is divisible by 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## The 37% Rule (Optimal Stopping Problem)

The number 37 also appears in a practical mathematical problem known as the "secretary problem" or "marriage problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. This applies to scenarios where one must make an immediate and final decision on sequential options without knowing all future options (e.g., renting an apartment, accepting a job offer, or finding a life partner) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

The optimal strategy to maximize the chance of picking the best option is to:
1.  **Explore Phase:** Automatically reject the first 37% (approximately 1/e, where e is Euler's number â‰ˆ 2.718) of the options to learn what's available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
2.  **Selection Phase:** After passing the 37% mark, select the *first* option that is better than all previous options seen during the exploration phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

Using this method, the chance of success (picking the best option) is also approximately 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. This rule can also be applied to time, for instance, spending the first 3.7 years of a 10-year period to explore options before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Mathematical Derivation
> The probability of selecting the best option ($P$) is given by $S/N \times \ln(N/S)$, where $N$ is the total number of options and $S$ is the stopping point. To maximize $P$, the derivative is set to 0, which results in $\ln(S/N) = -1$, leading to $S/N = 1/e \approx 0.3678$, or about 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## Conclusion

The number 37's frequent appearance as humanity's "go-to random number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, its prominence as a prime number, and its role in optimal decision-making strategies suggest a subconscious human inclination towards it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. This highlights how human intuition often aligns with underlying mathematical patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

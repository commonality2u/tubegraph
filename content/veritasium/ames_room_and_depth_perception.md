The [[ames_window_illusion | Ames window illusion]] and the Ames Room are powerful demonstrations of how our brains interpret visual information to construct a perception of reality, particularly concerning depth [[interpretation_of_visual_cues_and_reality | and depth perception]]. These illusions highlight the brain's reliance on assumptions about the environment and how these assumptions can be challenged to create seemingly impossible scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## The Ames Window Illusion

First developed by Adelbert Ames in 1947, the [[ames_window_illusion | Ames window illusion]] is an optical illusion where a continuously rotating trapezoidal window appears to oscillate back and forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

### Characteristics of the Ames Window
The window itself is not a rectangle but a trapezoid, with one side significantly shorter than the other, which is essential to the illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. It is also shaded to appear three-dimensional, but it is actually a two-dimensional card with the same image on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Even when aware of its true shape and continuous rotation, the brain still tends to perceive it as oscillating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

### Testing the Illusion
Adding objects like a Rubik's Cube to the short side of the trapezoid reveals bizarre perceptions; the cube may appear to continue rotating while the window oscillates independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Similarly, passing a ruler through the middle of the window leads to the ruler appearing to go through the window, defying physical impossibility in the observer's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This demonstrates that the brain prioritizes the illusion over actual physical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

The effectiveness of the illusion is also affected by lighting, which needs to be even on both sides to convince the brain of oscillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. The brain perceives the larger side of the trapezoid as closer, even when it's farther away, causing the apparent reversal of direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.

### The Carpentered Environment Hypothesis
Adelbert Ames, who originally wanted to be a visual artist, was fascinated by how people perceive shapes and shading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. He proposed that the key to the illusion lies in what he called the "carpentered environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Humans are accustomed to living in environments dominated by rectangular shapes and 90-degree angles (houses, rooms, doors, windows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. While the images on our retinas from these objects are often trapezoidal, our brains, through extensive experience, interpret these trapezoids as rectangles in perspective, inferring depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. The Ames window exploits this tendency by being a true trapezoid that the brain wrongly assumes to be a rotating rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

A 1957 study by Harvard psychologists in South Africa tested this hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Children from urban Durban (rectangular buildings) and rural communities (round huts) aged 10-14 were shown the Ames window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. 60% of the urban group saw oscillation, compared to only 17.5% of the rural group, supporting the carpentered environment hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

However, when subjects were seated 20 feet away with one eye closed, 90% of all participants, regardless of their environment, saw the oscillation, indicating other factors beyond the carpentered environment are at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

### Anamorphosis and Depth Perception
The [[ames_window_illusion | Ames window illusion]] and the de Heer circle (a similar illusion without straight lines that also appears to oscillate) utilize [[anamorphosis_in_art | anamorphosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. [[anamorphosis_in_art | Anamorphosis]] is an artistic technique involving a distorted projection of an object that only appears in its proper proportions when viewed from a specific position or with a particular device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. Historical examples include Hans Holbein the Younger's "The Ambassadors" (1533), which reveals a skull from a specific angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>, and Leonardo da Vinci's "Leonardo's Eye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. Even prehistoric cave paintings at Lascaux France may incorporate anamorphic principles due to uneven surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

## The Ames Room

The Ames Room is arguably Ames's most famous illusion, also central to [[anamorphosis_in_art | anamorphosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Designed in 1934, it appears as an ordinary rectangular room when viewed with one eye from a single, privileged perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. However, when people move within the room, it becomes clear that something is "not quite right," as objects and people appear to shrink or grow dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

### Construction of an Ames Room
An Ames Room is constructed by taking a regular rectangular room and adding a diagonal wall through its middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Lines connecting key parts of the room (corners, windows) are drawn to the privileged viewpoint, and their intersections with the diagonal wall are marked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. The floor and ceiling are then added, tilted and warped, and connected by trapezoidal walls, creating the illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

## Implications for Depth Perception and Reality
Ames realized that an infinite number of distorted room geometries could create virtually identical images of a normal room when viewed from the privileged position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. This demonstrates that our perceptions do not transparently represent external reality but are constantly faced with ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. Our brains subconsciously decide which of infinite possibilities we are observing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

One major form of ambiguity relates to depth perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. While closer objects typically appear bigger, brighter, and obscure objects behind them, these cues can be manipulated to defy expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. The ability to interpret depth cues appears to be an innate ability that forms very early in human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. Studies with babies aged 5.5 to 9 months showed that older infants (7.5 and 9 months) showed more interest in the Ames window, suggesting they perceived it as oscillating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.

These illusions challenge the idea that data alone can always resolve between competing theories or interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. Just as the Ames Room can be interpreted in infinite ways from a specific viewpoint, our brains are constantly making decisions about the [[interpretation_of_visual_cues_and_reality | interpretation of visual cues and reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. This underscores the need for humility and less certainty when forming conclusions about the world, recognizing that our brains can be fooled in spectacular ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>.

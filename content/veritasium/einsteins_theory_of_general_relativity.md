The understanding of curved geometries, initially developed as "strange new universes" by mathematicians exploring alternatives to Euclid's fifth postulate, became central to understanding our own universe some 80 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This foundational work culminated in [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | Einstein's theory of general relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

## From Special Relativity to General Relativity

In 1905, [[Einsteins theory of relativity | Einstein proposed the special theory of relativity]], based on two postulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>:
1.  "The laws of physics are the same in all [[Inertial observers and equivalence principle | inertial frames of reference]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
2.  "The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all [[Inertial observers and equivalence principle | inertial observers]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

As a result, space and time must be relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. This posed a problem for Newtonian gravity, which posited that the force of gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. In special relativity, this distance is no longer well-defined, leading Einstein to seek a way to reconcile relativity and gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

## Einstein's Happiest Thought and the Equivalence Principle

In 1907, [[Einsteins happiest thought and weightlessness | Einstein had the happiest thought of his life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>:
> "He imagined a man falling off the roof of a house." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>

Einstein realized that the falling man would feel absolutely weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. If he let go of an object, it would remain in uniform motion relative to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. This is analogous to being in deep space, far from any masses, floating in a spaceship at constant velocity, which defines an [[Inertial observers and equivalence principle | inertial observer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

Einstein's breakthrough was realizing that these two scenarios are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>: there is no experiment that can distinguish between being in free fall in a uniform gravitational field and being in deep space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. Therefore, the free-falling man is also an [[Inertial observers and equivalence principle | inertial observer]], meaning he is not accelerating and is not experiencing any force of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

## Gravity as Curved Spacetime

If gravity is not a force, then the orbit of the space station around Earth needs a new explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Astronauts in the space station feel weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>, just as if they are traveling at constant velocity in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. This is because they *are* traveling in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

The key insight of [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | general relativity]] is that this "straight line" appears curved to a distant observer because the [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | spacetime]] itself is curved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Massive objects curve spacetime, and objects moving through this [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | curved spacetime]] follow the shortest path, known as a [[Curved spacetime and geodesics | geodesic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

> While astronauts in the space station are following a straight line, it appears curved to a distant observer because the Earth curves the spacetime around it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>

The behavior of straight lines in curved geometries is core to understanding the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

## Experimental Verification and Predictions

Since its publication over a century ago, [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | the general theory of relativity]] has been remarkably successful, with countless findings supporting its predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

### Gravitational Lensing

In 2014, astronomers observed a supernova that appeared in four different places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. This phenomenon, known as gravitational lensing, occurs when a massive galaxy located between the supernova and Earth curves spacetime, causing light from the supernova to follow multiple paths to reach Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. The galaxy acted as a "massive gravitational lens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

Astronomers predicted they would see a replay of the supernova a year later due to different path lengths and gravitational potentials from other galaxies in the cluster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. This prediction was confirmed on December 11, 2015, when the same supernova was observed once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

### Gravitational Waves

Beyond observing the effects of curved spacetime, we can now measure its ripples directly, known as gravitational waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. These waves are formed by cosmic events like the merger of black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. A recent survey by NANOGrav suggests that the fabric of spacetime is "buzzing with the remnants of grand cosmic events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

## The Shape of the Universe

[[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | General relativity]] implies that the curvature of spacetime can vary from place to place, not limited to two-dimensional planes, but extending to three or more dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. The principles of different geometries can be used to determine the overall shape of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>:
*   **Flat geometry**: Angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
*   **Spherical geometry**: Angles add up to more than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **Hyperbolic geometry**: Angles add up to less than 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

### Measuring Cosmic Curvature

To determine the shape of the universe, scientists measure the angles of the largest possible triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. Looking further away in space is equivalent to looking further back in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. The earliest light visible is the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), a picture from when the universe was only 380,000 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

By analyzing the size of temperature variations in the CMB, which originated from quantum fluctuations in the early universe, astronomers can form "cosmic triangles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   If the universe is flat, the measured angle on the sky matches predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
*   If the universe is spherically curved, angles would be larger, and the predicted peak in the power spectrum would shift to the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.
*   If the universe has hyperbolic geometry, spots would appear smaller, shifting the peak to the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.

Data from the Plank mission shows results almost exactly consistent with a flat universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. The current best estimate for the curvature of the universe is 0.0007 Â± 0.0019, which is essentially zero within the margin of error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. Thus, we are fairly certain the universe we live in is flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

The flatness of the universe is remarkably serendipitous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. If the average mass-energy density were slightly higher, the universe would be more spherically curved; if slightly lower, it would exhibit hyperbolic geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>. The precise reason for the universe's specific mass-energy density remains an area of ongoing research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.

[[general_theory_of_relativity_and_gravity | General relativity]] stands as one of our best physical theories of reality, with its core being the "paradoxical and seemingly absurd geometries" that mathematicians explored for over two millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

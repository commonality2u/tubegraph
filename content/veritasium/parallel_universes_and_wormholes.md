The concept of [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | parallel universes]] and wormholes emerges from the mathematical solutions to Einstein's field equations, specifically from the "maximal extension" of spacetime diagrams describing black holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>.

## White Holes and Parallel Universes
The [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | general theory of relativity]], our best current theory of gravity, implies the existence of [[white_holes_and_theoretical_existence | white holes]] and even [[white_holes_and_theoretical_existence | parallel universes]], with a possible way to travel between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a>.

A Penrose diagram of a black hole allows for the visualization of these other regions. By drawing the past light cone from a point at the event horizon, a new region is revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This region represents a [[white_holes_and_theoretical_existence | white hole]], where things can come out, but nothing can ever enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

If objects are ejected in the opposite direction on the diagram, they could enter a "whole new universe, one parallel to our own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. In this theoretical scenario, someone in another universe could fall into a black hole in their universe, and both could find themselves in the same black hole before inevitably heading towards the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Mathematical Origin
The appearance of these [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | parallel universes]] is a consequence of "maximal extension" in the mathematical solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Schwarzschild's initial solution for an eternal, static black hole in an empty universe only described a portion of the possible spacetime geometry. By extending the coordinates beyond their initial scope, other regions emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

The simplest solution to Einstein's field equations, the Schwarzschild solution, inherently contains a black hole, a [[white_holes_and_theoretical_existence | white hole]], and two universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Pushing the map to its limits, so every edge ends at a singularity or infinity, can result in an effectively infinite number of universes connected through black holes and [[white_holes_and_theoretical_existence | white holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## Wormholes (Einstein-Rosen Bridges)
Within the Schwarzschild solution's maximal extension, there's also a feature called an Einstein-Rosen Bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This bridge theoretically connects the space of both universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Visualized as a physical path, it appears as a bridge that becomes extremely short before lengthening again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

However, these theoretical wormholes are not stable in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. The "pinching off" of the bridge happens too fast for anything to travel through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. In a Penrose diagram, there isn't a light cone path that could take someone from one universe to another without traveling faster than light, which is considered impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### Rotating Black Holes and Anti-verses
The Kerr solution, which describes a spinning black hole, is more complicated than the Schwarzschild solution and introduces dramatic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. It consists of multiple layers, including an inner event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

In a spinning black hole, the singularity is not a point but expands into a ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. The Penrose diagram for a spinning black hole shows the singularity moving to the sides, revealing a new region inside the inner horizon where one could theoretically move freely and avoid the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

Furthermore, if one were to aim straight towards the center of this ring singularity, they could find themselves in a strange universe called an "anti-verse," where gravity pushes instead of pulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. It's also theorized that one could jump back across the singularity to return to a universe with normal gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

This leads to a hypothetical picture where one could fall into a rotating black hole, fly through its singularity, and emerge from a [[white_holes_and_theoretical_existence | white hole]] into a new universe, continuing this process indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Reality of These Concepts
The maximally extended Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions describe eternal black holes in an empty universe, lacking a formation mechanism found in our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This is part of the reason why black holes are believed to exist, but [[white_holes_and_theoretical_existence | white holes]] are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

For the maximally extended Kerr solution, another problem arises: an immortal astronaut inside the universe could send light into the black hole, creating an infinite flux of energy along the inner horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This energy concentration would form its own singularity, effectively sealing off the ring singularity and any regions beyond it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This implies that all the [[white_holes_and_theoretical_existence | white holes]], wormholes, other universes, and anti-universes predicted by this theoretical solution would disappear in a realistic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### Traversable Wormholes
In 1987, Michael Morris and Kip Thorne investigated wormholes that could be used by an advanced civilization for interstellar travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. These hypothetical wormholes would need to:
*   Have no horizons, allowing for travel in both directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   Be stable in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   Be constructible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

They found several geometries allowed by [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | Einstein's general relativity]] that could theoretically connect different parts of the universe, creating a kind of interstellar highway, or even connect to different universes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

However, the major hurdle is that all these geometries require an "exotic kind of matter" with a negative energy density to prevent the wormhole from collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This exotic matter is considered to be "against the laws of physics" as currently understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

Based on current scientific understanding, it seems unlikely that [[white_holes_and_theoretical_existence | white holes]], traversable wormholes, and these [[General Theory of Relativity and black holes | parallel universes]] exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. However, the history of physics has shown that past beliefs about the impossibility of black holes were proven wrong, suggesting that future discoveries could again bring surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

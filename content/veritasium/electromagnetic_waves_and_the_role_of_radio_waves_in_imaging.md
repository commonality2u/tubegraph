The first-ever image of a black hole, released by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration on April 10th, 2019, showcased the supermassive black hole located at the center of the galaxy M87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This groundbreaking image was captured using [[the_role_of_electromagnetic_fields_in_energy_transmission | electromagnetic waves]] in the form of radio waves, specifically those with a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Why Radio Waves Were Used for Imaging
The choice of radio waves was crucial for imaging the M87 black hole for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
*   **Proximity to Event Horizon** Radio waves allowed scientists to visualize features very close to the event horizon of the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Penetration Capability** Unlike other wavelengths, radio waves can pass through dense cosmic structures such as the accretion disk surrounding the black hole and interstellar dust, enabling them to reach Earth-based telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Black Hole Characteristics and Imaging Observations
The image reveals plasma orbiting the supermassive black hole at the center of M87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This plasma is observed to be orbiting in a clockwise direction, completing one orbit in approximately two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Relativistic Effects
The phenomenon known as [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | relativistic beaming]] explains why regions of plasma traveling near the speed of light appear brighter when moving towards the observer and dimmer when moving away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This effect is also observable in the narrow, collimated jets extending from the M87 black hole, which are thought to be created by incredibly strong magnetic fields and stretch at least 5,000 light-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. One of these jets appears to point almost directly at Earth, and [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | relativistic beaming]] is again the reason it is visible in the image, while the receding jet is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Space-Time Warping
The warping of space-time around the black hole allows light from parts of the accretion disk *behind* the black hole to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This light is "lensed" and appears above and below the central shadow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Challenges in Black Hole Imaging
The resulting image of the M87 black hole appears fuzzy due to its extremely small apparent size from Earth's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. While the black hole itself is supermassive, with a mass 6.5 billion times that of our Sun and a shadow nearly the size of our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, its immense distance of 53.5 million light-years means its apparent size is only about 40 micro arcseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Achieving the necessary resolution to image such a tiny angular size is at the very limit of current technological capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. According to the basic law of physics, the diffraction limit, a telescope the size of the Earth would be required for this resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### The Event Horizon Telescope
Since building an Earth-sized telescope is impractical, scientists utilized eight telescopes spread across the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. These telescopes simultaneously observed M87, and as the Earth rotated, their collective observations helped simulate the aperture of an Earth-sized telescope, effectively overcoming the diffraction limit and enabling the image to be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Future Imaging Targets
The Event Horizon Telescope also observed Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. While an image of this black hole has not yet been released, simulations suggest it might look like a dynamic, varying structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Sagittarius A* is much closer at 26,000 light-years but significantly smaller, with a mass of only four million times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. It is also less active, periodically consuming matter, which leads to more significant temporal variations (matter orbiting every four to thirty minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. These variations likely contribute to the delay in releasing its image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The striking image of the black hole in M87 serves as definitive confirmation of the existence of black holes and spectacularly supports the general theory of relativity, published over a hundred years ago, at the limits of our ability to test the theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This achievement is a testament to the extreme dedication of the 200 scientists involved in pursuing a goal that once seemed impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

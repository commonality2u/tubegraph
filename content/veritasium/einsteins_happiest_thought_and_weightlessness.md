[[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | According to the general theory of relativity]], gravity is not a force; there are no gravitational fields, and gravity is described as an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This perspective is rooted in [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Albert Einstein's]] "happiest thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## The Happiest Thought

[[einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Albert Einstein's]] "happiest thought" was imagining a man falling off the roof of a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The profound realization that made him happy was that this falling man would not feel his own weight; he would be [[experiencing_weightlessness_for_the_first_time | weightless]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Furthermore, anything the man dropped during his fall would remain stationary relative to him, or move in uniform motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### The Equivalence Principle

[[einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein]] observed that the situation of a man falling from a roof is physically equivalent to being in deep space, far from any large masses, in a spaceship at rest or coasting at a constant velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. In deep space, an observer would also feel no weight, and objects would remain stationary or move in a straight line at constant velocity if pushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

[[einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's]] "big leap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> was to declare these two scenarios — a man freely falling and a "Rocket Man" in deep space — as physically equivalent, not just similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

*   **Inertial Observer**: Both the falling man and the "Rocket Man" are considered "inertial observers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This means they are not accelerating, are not in a gravitational field, and all laws of physics apply in their reference frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **The Experience of the Observer**: The key focus of [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein's]] equivalence principle is the experience of the observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. If an observer feels [[experiencing_weightlessness_for_the_first_time | weightless]], they are in an inertial frame of reference, regardless of an external perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

> "If they feel [[experiencing_weightlessness_for_the_first_time | weightless]] than they are in an inertial frame of reference every bit as good as rocket man's out drifting through deep space." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>

### Gravity as an Illusion

This principle leads to the conclusion that gravity is not a force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The man falling from the roof is not accelerating, and there are no gravitational fields acting on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. His apparent acceleration (increasing speed by 9.8 m/s every second) is only from the perspective of an external observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Similarly, astronauts on the space station are [[experiencing_weightlessness_for_the_first_time | weightless]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, meaning they are also inertial observers traveling on a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Curved Spacetime

The concept of a curved path without gravitational forces is explained by curved spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The "Rocket Man" feels like he is moving with constant velocity in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> because he is moving in a straight line through spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. However, spacetime around massive objects like planets is curved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

*   **Geodesics**: The shortest paths over curved surfaces are called geodesics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This term is also used for the straight-line paths followed by inertial observers through curved spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Analogy**: Just as two people walking "due North" on Earth's curved surface will eventually meet at the North Pole, giving the illusion of a force pushing them together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, gravity is analogous to this illusory force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The true reason for their convergence is that they are both on straight paths (geodesics) on a curved surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

The famous "bent sheet analogy" for curved spacetime can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> because it might incorrectly reinforce the Newtonian intuition of objects "falling" towards a well due to gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Instead, it should illustrate objects traveling in straight lines through spacetime that is curved around massive objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

> "Matter tells spacetime how to curve, and spacetime tells matter how to move." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>

## Acceleration and Staying Still

If a rocket in deep space accelerates at 9.8 meters per second squared, someone inside would feel a force pushing up on their feet, exactly like the force felt when at rest on the surface of Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This implies that being at rest on Earth's surface is physically the same as accelerating in a rocket ship in deep space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

*   **No Gravitational Force**: In [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | general relativity]], there is no gravitational force on a person standing on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The only force is the normal force from the floor pushing upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This means a person standing still is actually accelerating upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Deviation from Geodesic**: Acceleration is redefined as a deviation from a geodesic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The floor prevents one from following a straight-line path through spacetime, applying an upward force, thus causing an upward acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Curved Spacetime Equation**: In curved spacetime, one needs to accelerate just to stand still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Why All Objects Fall at the Same Rate

[[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | General relativity]] simplifies a classical mystery: why all objects fall at the same rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

*   **Newtonian Explanation**: In Newtonian physics, the cancellation of gravitational mass and inertial mass in the force equation (Gmm/r^2 = ma) explains why objects fall at the same rate, but the mystery is why these two conceptually different masses are numerically identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **General Relativity Explanation**: In [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | general relativity]], there is no mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. All objects *appear* to fall the same way because they are not accelerating; they are simply following straight-line paths through spacetime until something stops them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

## Experimental Verification

[[einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein]] proposed a measurable prediction to test his theory: light should bend when it passes a large mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

*   **Light Bending**: If a rocket accelerates, light inside it appears to deflect downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. By the equivalence principle, light must also bend when passing a large mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Eddington's Eclipse Experiment**: In 1919, during a total solar eclipse, Arthur Eddington photographed stars near the Sun. His analysis showed their positions were deflected by the precise amount predicted by [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | Einstein's general theory of relativity]], which was twice the deflection calculated by a strictly Newtonian model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This confirmed [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | general relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

### Unperformed Experiment

A conceptually simple experimental test involves comparing the behavior of a stationary charge in a gravitational field to a free-falling one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

*   **Newtonian Prediction**: A stationary charge should not radiate electromagnetic radiation, but a free-falling one (being accelerated by gravity) should radiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **General Relativity Prediction**: [[einsteins_theory_of_general_relativity | General relativity]] posits that a free-falling charge is non-accelerating and thus should not radiate. Conversely, a stationary charge (which is accelerating upwards relative to an inertial frame) *should* give off electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

Logistical challenges have prevented this experiment from being carried out, but it highlights the fundamental difference in understanding the nature of gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

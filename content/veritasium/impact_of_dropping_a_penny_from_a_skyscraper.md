The common urban legend suggests that a penny dropped from the top of the Empire State Building could kill someone on the sidewalk below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This myth has led many visitors to the Empire State Building to throw pennies off the observation deck, resulting in ledges filled with change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Penny Drop Experiment

To test this myth, a penny drop experiment was conducted with former MythBuster Adam Savage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. A penny weighs about two and a half grams, roughly half to a quarter the weight of a bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Without considering air resistance, a penny dropped from the Empire State Building's top (443 meters high) would accelerate to over 300 kilometers per hour by the time it hits the ground, which is about half the speed of a typical bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

However, the ultimate test of dropping pennies from skyscraper height onto a person had never been tried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. In this experiment, Adam Savage dropped pennies from a helicopter onto a person below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The helicopter's downdraft was a factor not initially planned for, which could affect the pennies' fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

When hit, the pennies felt like "tiny little bullets" and caused a sting, but were not fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The experiment concluded that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building is not going to cause significant harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## The Physics of Falling Objects: Air Resistance and Terminal Velocity

The primary reason pennies are not dangerous when dropped from great heights is **air resistance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

The classic experiment of dropping a hammer and a feather on the moon demonstrates that in a vacuum, both objects accelerate at the same rate and hit the ground simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. On Earth, however, the hammer lands significantly before the feather due to air resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

A falling object reaches its **terminal velocity** when the force of gravity pulling it down equals the force of air resistance pushing it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. At this point, the object stops accelerating and falls at a constant speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

While the feather is clearly affected by drag, the hammer actually experiences a greater force of air resistance because air resistance is proportional to speed squared, and the hammer gets much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. However, the hammer's weight is so much greater that drag is negligible in comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The behavior of a falling object comes down to the ratio of its weight to air resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Factors Affecting Terminal Velocity

*   **Size and Shape**: Objects with the same size and shape experience the same air resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Weight**: A heavier object of the same size and shape will have a higher terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Air Density**: Air resistance is directly proportional to the density of the air an object moves through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This is why Felix Baumgartner, jumping from 39 kilometers above sea level in 2012, reached a terminal velocity over 1300 kilometers per hour (25% faster than the speed of sound) due to the lack of air at that altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. As he fell into thicker atmosphere, his terminal velocity decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Examples of Terminal Velocity

*   **Raindrops**: Rain falls through the troposphere, and raindrops have a low terminal velocity of just 25 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Raindrops are typically between 0.5 and four millimeters in diameter and are closer to spherical, but flatter on the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Hail**: Hail can reach terminal velocities of over 200 kilometers per hour, about 10 times that of rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This is because hail can get much bigger than raindrops (up to 20 centimeters in diameter), and while drag scales with radius squared, weight scales with radius cubed, meaning bigger hailstones have faster terminal velocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Larger hailstones also carry more kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Pennies and Terminal Velocity

Pennies reach their terminal velocity after falling only about 15 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This means that dropping a penny from 15 meters, 300 meters, or 3000 meters would feel the same, as they would be going the same speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The helicopter in the experiment did not need to go to Empire State Building height because it would not have increased the pennies' speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

Pennies also flutter and tumble as they fall, leading to two terminal velocities—one on their face and one on their edge—as they oscillate between these states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Ultimately, the terminal velocity of a penny is at most about 80 kilometers per hour, which is not dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Other Falling Objects

### Ballpoint Pens

Some speculate that ballpoint pens dropped from a skyscraper could be lethal due to being more aerodynamic than pennies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. These pens weigh about twice as much as a penny and have a smaller cross-sectional area, which should increase their weight-to-drag ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

An experiment was conducted using a ballistics gel dummy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. After dropping multiple plastic pens, no significant impact was observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The conclusion was that plastic ballpoint pens are not dangerous falling from tall objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. They still have too much drag relative to their weight to achieve a high terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Narrow metal pens might still be dangerous, however <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

### Bullets

The "Drag Coefficient" is a dimensionless number that captures how smoothly air flows around an object, affecting air resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. Modern bullets have a drag coefficient between 0.1 and 0.3, significantly lower than a sphere's 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

When a bullet is *dropped* from a skyscraper, it would not fall pointy side down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Instead, it would tumble and likely fall on its side, as cylinders tend to fall on their sides for stability, finding the orientation with the highest resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. A bullet fired straight up will slow down, stop at its highest point (up to three kilometers), and then fall back down like a dropped bullet, tumbling and experiencing far more air resistance than on the way up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. It would reach the ground much slower than its launch speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

However, if a bullet is fired *not* completely vertical, it poses a greater danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. It maintains its horizontal velocity and the spin imparted by the gun barrel, keeping it moving pointy-end forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. This allows it to speed up to a significant fraction of its launch speed upon returning to the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. This is why celebratory gunfire, though accidental, has resulted in hundreds of fatalities worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## [[historical_and_modern_use_of_falling_objects_as_weapons | Historical and Modern Use of Falling Objects as Weapons]]

The concept of dropping deadly projectiles from aircraft is almost as old as aviation itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

*   **Fléchettes**: In World War I, small pieces of metal resembling nails with feathers were dropped from planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. These "little arrows" (some up to 15 centimeters long) did not require explosives, were cheap to produce, and could pierce helmets, causing serious injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. Some reports indicated darts going through a rider and his horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.
*   **Lazy Dogs**: Later, the US developed similar but heftier weapons called Lazy Dogs, used in the Korean and Vietnam wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. They inflicted indiscriminate damage but did not leave unexploded ordnance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

Militaries continue to use kinetic projectiles for precision strikes today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

## [[safety_and_risks_of_falling_objects_in_urban_environments | Safety and Risks of Falling Objects in Urban Environments]]

Falling objects are a danger in civilian life, with nearly 700 Americans dying each year from being struck by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. These can range from loose tiles and bricks to construction tools, rocks, tree branches, and even icicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. Icicles were a serious concern, leading to street closures around New York's One World Trade Center in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### Lethality of Falling Objects

The lower limit of energy required to fracture a human skull is approximately 68 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Anything with kinetic energy greater than that is very likely to be lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

*   A raindrop at terminal velocity delivers only 0.002 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   A falling penny has about 0.2 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   A baseball and the largest measured hailstone can deliver over 80 Joules, enough to crack a skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   In 2014, a man was killed by a measuring tape that fell 50 stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.
*   While a falling fléchette's energy isn't enough to fracture a skull, it can apply a large force to a very small area, causing damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

In conclusion, a penny or a plastic pen falling from a skyscraper is not fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. Objects that weigh only a few grams and are not aerodynamic are unlikely to be deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. However, objects weighing more than a few hundred grams traveling at terminal velocity are likely to be deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

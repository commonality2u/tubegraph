NASA faces significant challenges in designing wheels for space exploration due to the extreme conditions found on other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. These challenges include the lack of atmospheric pressure, extreme temperatures, and the need for lightweight yet durable materials that can withstand aggressive terrain without permanent deformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. To address these issues, NASA has been exploring [[airless_tire_technology | airless tire technology]] using shape memory alloys like Nitinol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## Challenges of Space Wheels

The environmental conditions on celestial bodies like the Moon and Mars pose several obstacles for traditional wheel designs:
*   **Lack of Atmospheric Pressure:** Pneumatic (air-filled) tires cannot be used because there is no confining pressure outside, leading to a risk of explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **Extreme Temperatures:** Temperatures can vary wildly; for instance, on the Moon, a surface facing the sun can be 250 degrees Fahrenheit above zero, while a shadowed area is 250 degrees below zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Rubber becomes brittle at such low temperatures, transforming from flexible to rigid, making it unsuitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Weight Limitations:** Launching mass into space is expensive, requiring wheels to be as lightweight as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Terrain:** The harsh and aggressive terrain on other planets causes high peak loads on wheels, leading to damage like holes and cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. This reduces performance and can jeopardize missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

### Previous Wheel Designs

*   **Aluminum Wheels (e.g., Curiosity Rover)**:
    *   Made from a single billet of aluminum to avoid fasteners or welds that could be failure points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
    *   Designed with a thin skin (0.7 millimeters, thinner than a credit card) to meet mass limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
    *   Features structural members called grousers to provide strength and help grab soil and obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
    *   Despite their design, these wheels have suffered significant damage on Mars, with big holes and cracks in the skin, affecting the rover's mobility and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

*   **Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) Wheels**:
    *   Utilized a "pantograph" structure consisting of woven wires (over, under, over, under) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
    *   Tread strips, covering roughly 50% of the surface, prevented the tire from sinking into the ground while maintaining flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
    *   Incorporated an internal "bump stop" to limit deformation and prevent plastic deformation of the steel mesh when hitting obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.
    *   These wheels performed well for the short distances traveled on the moon (e.g., 36 kilometers for the farthest journey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
    *   However, for longer missions, a bump stop is insufficient to prevent the buildup of plastic deformation over time, as demonstrated by the permanent deformation seen in Earth-tested steel spring tires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

## Nitinol: The Material for Future Wheels

The need for a material that is both strong and durable like steel, but capable of enduring much more strain without permanent deformation, led to the investigation of Nitinol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

### Discovery and Properties of Nitinol
Nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium, was discovered in 1961 at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. It exhibits two extraordinary properties:
*   **Shape Memory Effect**: When heated, Nitinol can return to a predefined "parent" shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. This is due to a solid-state phase change between two crystal structures:
    *   **Austenite**: The cubic lattice arrangement present in heated Nitinol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Martensite**: A messier, lower symmetry arrangement that forms upon cooling (twinned martensite) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. When stress is applied to martensite, its crystal structure changes to detwinned martensite, deforming the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. Heating it back up converts it to austenite, returning it to its original shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.
*   **Superelasticity (Pseudoelasticity)**: Nitinol can stretch up to 8% of its length and still spring back to its original size, significantly more than ordinary metals (0.3% to 0.8% elastically) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This occurs when Nitinol is in the austenite phase at temperatures above its martensite transition temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. Applying stress forces a phase change from austenite to detwinned martensite, which allows for extensive deformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. When the stress is removed, the atoms revert to the austenite phase, and the material returns to its original shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>. This stress-induced phase change can even release heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>.

### Nitinol in Wheel Design

NASA has developed [[applications_in_aerospace_and_space_technology | Nitinol]] tires by weaving Nitinol springs together into a mesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>. This intricate process involves manually screwing 684 individual springs per tire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.

**Advantages of Nitinol Wheels:**
*   **Durability:** The superelasticity of Nitinol allows the tire to deform up to 8% without permanent damage, crucial for long-duration space missions on rough terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>.
*   **Load Distribution:** By tying in a "bump stop" element to the tire, the load from a footprint is transferred 360 degrees around the tire, significantly increasing its load-carrying capacity without adding mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.
*   **Integrated Suspension:** The material's ability to dissipate energy during its stress-induced phase change means the tire itself can act as a shock absorber or damper, potentially becoming a complete suspension system and simplifying vehicle construction for space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.
*   **Airless Design:** As they don't rely on pressurized air, these tires cannot go flat, eliminating issues with punctures and maintaining consistent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### Testing and Applications

Nitinol wheels undergo extensive testing on rotating carousels with different terrain types, including simulated Moon regolith and Mars surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>. These tests ensure the wheels can handle typical rover speeds (e.g., 6.7 centimeters per second) and various obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>.

Beyond [[space_exploration_challenges | space exploration]], this [[airless_tire_technology | airless tire technology]] is being investigated for terrestrial [[applications_in_aerospace_and_space_technology | applications]], such as:
*   **Aircraft Tires:** Conventional aircraft tires require very high pressurization (300-400 psi) and are prone to explosion or require constant maintenance. Nitinol tires could eliminate these issues, improve fuel economy by preventing under-inflation, and simplify maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>.
*   **Automotive:** Tested on a Jeep, the airless design prevents flat tires and improves fuel economy due to consistent inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>.

These durable, "magic metal" tires are designed to last the entire lifetime of a rover mission, even on the rough terrain of Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>.

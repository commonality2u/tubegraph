Thomas Midgley Jr. was a chemist and engineer whose inventions, while initially seen as beneficial, had devastating long-term consequences for global public health and the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His work is linked to millions of deaths, a decrease in average human intelligence, increased crime rates, and two significant environmental disasters that continue to impact the world today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Development of Leaded Gasoline

In 1911, the Cadillac Model 30, a powerful new car, faced a problem: "engine knocking," a loud and damaging phenomenon caused by fuel spontaneously combusting before the spark plug ignition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:04">[04:04:04]</a>. Engine knocking reduced power output, lowered fuel efficiency, and damaged engine components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:03">[05:03:03]</a>. Different fuels have varying abilities to withstand compression before detonating, quantified by the octane rating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:20">[05:20:20]</a>.

Charles Kettering, tasked with finding an additive to increase fuel's octane rating and eliminate knocking, hired 27-year-old Thomas Midgley Jr. in 1917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:08">[07:08:08]</a>. After experimenting with numerous compounds, Midgley found that ethanol stopped knocking but was too expensive and required high concentrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:33">[07:33:33]</a>. Tellurium also worked but produced an unbearable smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:53">[07:53:53]</a>.

On December 3, 1921, after five years of research, Midgley discovered tetraethyl lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:21">[08:21:21]</a>. This additive was effective at low concentrations (one part in 1000), didn't smell, was cheap, and readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:32">[08:32:32]</a>. Midgley and Kettering patented the process and named the additive "Ethyl," possibly to avoid association with lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:12">[09:12:12]</a>. They partnered with General Motors, DuPont, and Standard Oil of New Jersey to form the Ethyl Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:22">[09:22:22]</a>.

## The [[the_controversy_and_consequences_of_leaded_gasoline | Controversy and Consequences of Leaded Gasoline]]

Despite early success, the use of leaded gasoline quickly led to problems. Within two months of operating a new chemical plant in New Jersey, dozens of workers fell ill, and five died from lead poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:13">[10:13:13]</a>. To counter public outcry, Midgley publicly demonstrated the safety of tetraethyl lead by pouring it on his hands and inhaling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:27">[10:27:27]</a>. However, Midgley himself had spent much of 1923 recovering from lead poisoning and knew the dangers firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:40">[10:40:40]</a>.

Lead is a "creeping and malicious poison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:11">[12:11:11]</a> that mimics calcium, making it difficult for the body to expel, and it can be stored in bones for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. The brain is particularly sensitive to lead, which damages myelin sheaths and prevents neurotransmitter release, leading to headaches, memory loss, and tingling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:17">[11:17:17]</a>. Children are highly susceptible; lead exposure can cause permanent learning disorders and behavioral problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:31">[11:31:31]</a>. The toxicity of lead had been known for centuries, with Benjamin Franklin warning about its dangers in 1786 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:37">[11:37:37]</a>. Doctors and public health officials from institutions like MIT, Harvard, Yale, and the U.S. Health Service warned Midgley against tetraethyl lead production, but their concerns were dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:04">[12:04:04]</a>.

By the 1950s, millions of motorists worldwide were releasing lead into the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:38">[12:38:38]</a>. Clair Patterson, a chemist working on measuring the age of the Earth, encountered lead contamination in his samples, leading him to research global lead pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:46">[12:46:46]</a>. His research revealed:
*   Lead concentrations in oceans were ten times higher near the surface, indicating recent pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:13">[15:13:13]</a>.
*   Ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica showed a massive spike in atmospheric lead in the 20th century due to industrialization and tetraethyl lead, far exceeding historical levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:28">[15:28:28]</a>.
*   Twentieth-century Americans had 1000 times more lead in their bones than people from 1600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:26">[16:26:26]</a>.

### Impacts on Public Health and Society

Lead exposure, even at levels once considered safe, causes delayed learning, [[controversies_and_criticisms_of_IQ_tests | decreased IQ]], and increased behavioral problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:39">[16:39:39]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Decline**: Lead is believed to be responsible for nearly two-thirds of all unexplained intellectual disability globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:24">[17:24:24]</a>. A 2022 study estimated that over half the U.S. population (170 million people) was exposed to high lead levels in early childhood, resulting in an aggregate loss of over 800 million IQ points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:30">[17:30:30]</a>.
*   **Crime Rates**: A strong correlation exists between preschool blood lead levels and crime rates 20 years later, observed in multiple countries like the U.S., Britain, Canada, and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:09">[18:09:09]</a>. Studies show a causal link between lead exposure and antisocial or violent behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:34">[18:34:34]</a>.
*   **Mortality**: Lead hardening of the arteries likely caused 250,000 heart disease deaths per year in the U.S. alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:02">[19:02:02]</a>. Globally, the figure may approach 100 million deaths over the past century, largely due to leaded gasoline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:27">[19:27:27]</a>. Current estimates still attribute 500,000 to 900,000 deaths per year to lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:43">[19:43:43]</a>.

Japan banned leaded fuel in 1986, and Algeria was the last country to do so in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:47">[22:47:47]</a>. The elimination of lead from gasoline saves over a million lives and $2.45 trillion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:58:58">[22:58:58]</a>. However, leaded gas is still used in piston-driven airplane engines, which are now the largest source of lead emissions in the U.S. air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:08">[23:08:08]</a>.

## Development of Freon (CFCs)

After the success of Ethyl, Midgley was tasked by General Motors (which also made household appliances) to find a safer refrigerant for fridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:11">[20:11:11]</a>. The common refrigerants, methyl formate (toxic) and sulfur dioxide (flammable), were problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:21">[20:21:21]</a>.

In 1928, Midgley developed dichlorodifluoromethane, a non-toxic and non-flammable refrigerant that GM marketed as Freon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:33">[20:33:33]</a>. To demonstrate its safety, Midgley famously inhaled the gas and used it to blow out a candle at an American Chemical Society unveiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:41">[20:41:41]</a>.

## The [[environmental_and_health_impacts_of_PFAS_chemicals | Environmental and Health Impacts of PFAS Chemicals]]

In subsequent decades, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) like Freon became widely used as solvents and aerosols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:55">[20:55:55]</a>. However, their light and stable nature meant that when released, they would ascend into the stratosphere and persist for 50 to 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:01">[21:01:01]</a>. There, UV photons would break them apart, releasing chlorine atoms that react with and deplete the ozone layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:13">[21:13:13]</a>.

The resulting [[global_contamination_and_persistence_of_forever_chemicals | hole in the ozone layer]] led to more UV light penetrating the atmosphere, increasing rates of skin cancer and cataracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:29">[21:29:29]</a>. Additionally, CFCs are potent greenhouse gases, producing 10,000 times more warming per kilogram than CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:38">[21:38:38]</a>. Historian John McNeil noted that Midgley had "more impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth's history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:47">[21:47:47]</a>.

The Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to phase out CFCs, went into effect in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:54">[21:54:54]</a>. The ozone layer is now showing signs of recovery, though full restoration will take many more decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:02">[22:02:02]</a>.

## Later Life and Death

In 1940, at age 51, Midgley contracted polio, which left him physically disabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:08">[22:08:08]</a>. He devised a mechanical bed with ropes and pulleys to help him get up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:12">[22:12:12]</a>. On November 2, 1944, he became tangled in the ropes of his invention and died of strangulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:17">[22:17:17]</a>.

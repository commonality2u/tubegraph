While the speed of light is precisely defined as 299,792,458 meters per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, and has been used since 1983 to define the length of a meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, it is asserted that no one has actually measured the speed of light in a way that proves it always travels at this exact speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The fundamental challenge lies in the inability to measure the [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | one-way speed of light]].

## The Problem of Measurement

Measuring the speed of any object typically requires knowing the distance between two points and the time it takes to travel that distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. However, applying this to light presents unique challenges:

*   **Single Clock Insufficiency:** If a laser fires a beam over a distance (e.g., one kilometer) and a single clock is used at the start, there's no way to know precisely when the light reaches the end of the path to stop the timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Two Clocks and Synchronization:** Using two clocks, one at the start and one at the end, requires them to be perfectly synchronized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   **Synchronization by Wire:** Connecting clocks with a wire to send a pulse for synchronization doesn't work because the pulse itself travels at the speed of light, introducing an unknown time delay equal to the travel time, which is precisely what is trying to be measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   **Moving Clocks:** Synchronizing clocks together and then moving one to the end point also fails. Special relativity dictates that moving clocks tick slower relative to stationary observers, causing them to lose synchronization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Measuring the Two-Way Speed of Light

The only practical solution to this problem is to use a single clock and measure the time for light to make a round trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Hippolyte Fizeau's Experiment (1849)

Hippolyte Fizeau conducted the first experimental measurement of the speed of light in 1849 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. He shone a light beam through a rapidly spinning gear's teeth to a mirror 8 kilometers away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. By increasing the gear's speed, he reached a point where the reflected light passed through the *next* gap in the gear, allowing it to be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Fizeau measured the speed of light to be 313,000 kilometers per second, within 5% of the accepted value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

> "What has been measured is the round trip or [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | two-way speed of light]], but no one has measured the [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | one-way speed of light]]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

## The Unknowable One-Way Speed of Light

It is currently impossible to measure the [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | one-way speed of light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This means it's [[possible_variations_of_light_speed_in_different_directions | possible that the speed of light]] could be different in different directions, as long as the round-trip average remains 'c' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Hypothetical Scenario: Asymmetric Light Speed

Consider communication with an astronaut, Mark, on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If a signal is sent from Earth and a response is received 20 minutes later, the conventional assumption is that the signal took 10 minutes to reach Mars and the reply took 10 minutes to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. However, it's equally possible that the original message took the full 20 minutes to reach Mars, and the reply came back instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. There is no experiment that could distinguish between these two scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

The [[possible_variations_of_light_speed_in_different_directions | speed of light could vary]] from a few percent up to 'c' over two in one direction and infinitely fast in the other, without violating known physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This possibility arises from the universe's asymmetry, such as the matter-antimatter imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Failed Attempts to Measure One-Way Speed

Scientists have attempted to measure the [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | one-way speed of light]] for over 100 years, but all proposed methods ultimately revert to measuring the [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | two-way speed of light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

*   **High-Speed Cameras:** A camera capable of shooting at a trillion frames per second might seem to show light passing through an object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. However, the camera is observing light that has traveled to the object *and* bounced back to the camera, thus measuring the [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | two-way speed of light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Fiber Optic Cable:** Using a very long fiber optic cable with light shone through one end and detected at the other still measures the round trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Light traveling around the loops of the cable averages out, effectively becoming a series of round trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Centralized Synchronizing Device:** A device placed between two clocks sending out simultaneous pulses would perfectly synchronize the clocks *if* the speed of light were the same in both directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. But if the speed of light differs, one clock would be ahead of the other by just the right amount to make any subsequent measurement of the one-way speed of light appear to be 'c' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **GPS Synchronization:** The entire GPS system relies on the assumption that the speed of light is the same in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. If it were different, light pulses from satellites would travel at varying speeds, leading to improperly synced clocks that would *always* measure 'c' for the [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | one-way speed of light]], regardless of its true value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Moving Clocks Apart:** Starting with synchronized clocks in the middle and moving them apart at equal and opposite speeds seems to account for time dilation, ensuring they remain synchronized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. However, this only works if the speed of light is the same in both directions. If it depends on direction, then so does time dilation, making the standard formula for calculation inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

The core dilemma is that synchronized clocks are needed to measure the [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | one-way speed of light]], but the [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | one-way speed of light]] is needed to synchronize clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

## The Einstein Synchronization Convention

In his famous 1905 paper, "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies," Albert Einstein addressed the problem of synchronizing clocks at different locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. He stated that there is no meaningful way to compare the times measured by such clocks "unless we established by definition that the time required by light to travel from A to B equals the time it requires to travel from B to A" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

This means Einstein *defined* the [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | speed of light]] in opposite directions to be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This is known as the [[implications_of_unknown_oneway_speed_of_light_on_physics | Einstein synchronization convention]], and it is a convention or stipulation, not an experimentally verified fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

> "The idea that the speed of light is the same in opposite directions... is neither a supposition nor a hypothesis about the physical nature of light, but a stipulation that I can make of my own free will to arrive at a definition of simultaneity." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>

Physics works the same whether the [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | one-way speed of light]] is 'c' in every direction or 'c' over two in one direction and instantaneous in the other, as long as the round-trip average remains 'c' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## Implications of the Unknowable One-Way Speed of Light

The inability to measure the [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | one-way speed of light]] has significant [[implications_of_unknown_oneway_speed_of_light_on_physics | implications for physics]] and our understanding of the universe:

*   **Simultaneity:** The concept of "right now" at distant locations becomes subjective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. If clocks are synchronized using the Einstein convention, but the [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | one-way speed of light]] is actually asymmetric, distant clocks will be out of sync, and there's no way for observers to detect or correct this error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. For example, if light to Mars is 'c'/2 and instantaneous back, an Earth observer sees Mars in real-time, while a Mars observer sees Earth as it was 20 minutes ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **Hidden Aspect of the Universe:** This fundamental aspect of the universe—the true [[understanding_the_twoway_vs_oneway_speed_of_light | one-way speed of light]]—remains hidden from us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Future Physics Breakthroughs:** Some physicists speculate that this unresolved question might be a crucial clue for the next "paradigmatic leap" in physics, potentially connecting General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, space, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

While many physicists adhere to Occam's razor, finding it simpler to assume light travels at the same speed in all directions, it remains a convention rather than an empirically verified fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

The Europa Clipper is NASA's most advanced mission to hunt for signs of [[potential_for_alien_life_on_europa | alien life]] in the solar system, set to launch in October 2024 to Jupiter's moon Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Inspiration and Early Suspicions

The idea of Europa as a potential host for life was popularized in Arthur C. Clarke's 1982 novel, "2010, Odyssey Two," where an alien intelligence converts Jupiter into a star and warns astronauts to "attempt no landing there" on Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This literary work highlighted early suspicions that Europa might offer the best chance of finding [[potential_for_alien_life_on_europa | alien life]] in our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_exploring_jupiters_moons | Challenges of Exploring Jupiter's Moons]]

Jupiter's environment poses significant [[challenges_of_exploring_jupiters_moons | challenges for exploration]] due to its powerful magnetic field and intense radiation belts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Jupiter's Magnetic Field
Deep within Jupiter, hydrogen is believed to form a metallic liquid due to extreme pressure, which generates an incredibly powerful magnetic field, nearly 20,000 times stronger than Earth's at the same distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This field would appear twice as large as the full moon if viewed from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Io's Volcanic Activity and Radiation Belts
Io, Jupiter's most volcanically active moon, continuously shoots out tons of sulfur dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Approximately one ton of this material is ionized every second and trapped within Jupiter's magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The field accelerates these particles to over 300 kilometers per second, causing them to whizz around with Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This trapped material slams into other moons, ejecting more particles and forming massive radiation belts that extend past Europa and other Jovian moons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Impact on Electronics
This intense radiation is detrimental to electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Missions like Pioneer 10 and Voyager in the 1970s experienced glitches, false commands, and corrupted data during brief flybys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Even with modern shielding, a spacecraft within these belts would only survive for about three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Clipper's Mission Strategy

To survive the hazardous environment, the Europa Clipper will not orbit Europa directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Instead, it will orbit Jupiter from afar and then swoop in every few weeks to perform quick flybys of Europa before retreating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. During downtime away from the radiation belts, the mission can transmit collected data back to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The mission plans for 49 flybys, aiming to map almost the entire surface of Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The name "Clipper" is inspired by the fast, nimble 19th-century clipper ships that quickly moved in and out of ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Why Europa? The Search for Life

Despite Europa's surface being exposed to 5,400 milliSieverts of radiation daily (1,800 times Earth's annual dose), leading to radiation sickness and death within hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, scientists believe it holds a secret: a subsurface ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### Evidence of a Subsurface Ocean

*   **Lack of Craters**: Images from Voyager 1 in 1979 revealed a striking absence of craters on Europa's surface compared to other moons, suggesting recent geological activity (within the last 60 million years) that erases these impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Galileo's Magnetometer Readings**: The Galileo mission, arriving at Jupiter 16 years after Voyager, detected that Jupiter's wobbling magnetic field induces a strong magnetic field on Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This indicates an electrically conductive layer close to Europa's surface, only tens of kilometers deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Surface Composition**: Europa's white surface is covered in a thick crust of water ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Reddish-brown regions on the surface, when bombarded with intense radiation, turn from white to a brownish color, similar to sea salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This suggests the presence of hydrated salts and supports the theory of a deep saltwater ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This suspected ocean could be 100 kilometers deep, containing twice as much water as Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Tidal Flexing and Heat Generation**: Europa's eccentric orbit around Jupiter, influenced by Io and Ganymede, causes it to be constantly stretched and squeezed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This "tidal flexing" generates friction and enough heat to keep the deep ocean liquid despite surface temperatures of -160 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. If an ocean is present, Europa's surface would flex by 30 meters in amplitude, compared to only one meter without an ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Cycloids**: Strange, multi-arcuate features called cycloids on Europa's surface are thought to form if cracks propagate at a slow speed, following the changing stress field from tidal squeezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The amplitude of this motion requires an ocean to explain the cracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### Conditions for Life

*   **Hydrothermal Vents**: Tidal flexing can push magma closer to the seafloor, heating water that flows through the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This creates hydrothermal vents, similar to those on Earth, which are oases for ocean life, relying on bacteria that feed on minerals rather than sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Chemical Fuels**: An ocean that has existed for potentially four billion years could allow for the evolution of single-celled organisms that use chemical reactions (methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur) as fuel for metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Radiation's Unexpected Benefit**: Paradoxically, Jupiter's radiation can make Europa a better candidate for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. High-speed particles hitting the surface provide energy for water and carbon dioxide molecules to form new compounds like formaldehyde or hydrogen peroxide, which can serve as food for life if they reach the subsurface ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Evidence of ice shell overturn at "chaos zones" suggests ways for these compounds to reach the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## How Europa Clipper Will Hunt for Life

The Europa Clipper will not drill through the kilometers-thick ice crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Searching for Plumes
The mission hopes to fly through potential water geysers, or plumes, shooting out of Europa's surface, similar to how the "SnotBot" drone collects whale snot on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. The Hubble Space Telescope has picked up evidence of these geysers on Europa, similar to those confirmed on Saturn's moon Enceladus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Flying through these plumes would allow Clipper to reveal their chemical composition using a mass spectrometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

### Onboard Instruments
Clipper carries several instruments to investigate Europa's potential for life:
*   **Infrared Spectrometer**: To identify and map chemical fingerprints of light bounced off the surface, helping locate salts and organic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Ultraviolet Spectrograph**: To detect and study plumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Cameras**:
    *   **Wide Angle Camera**: To take swaths of images of the entire globe at better than 100 meters per pixel resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
    *   **Narrow Angle Camera**: To capture half-meter per pixel images from 50 kilometers altitude, capable of resolving small objects on Europa's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### Future Missions: Europa Lander
A future mission, like a lander, would be necessary to directly search for signs of life on Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Studies suggest a lander could survive for about a month on the surface, sufficient to scoop up material from below the radiation-processed depth and analyze it with a mass spectrometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## [[collaborative_space_exploration_efforts | Collaborative Space Exploration Efforts]]: JUICE Mission

The Europa Clipper mission will not be studying Jupiter's moons alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. The European Space Agency's (ESA) JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer) mission is already en route to Jupiter, arriving about 15 months after Clipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. JUICE will conduct a few flybys of Europa before orbiting Ganymede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Informal conversations are ongoing between the Clipper and JUICE science teams to maximize scientific output by coordinating observations, such as detecting bursts from Jupiter that both spacecraft can measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. This demonstrates the potential for [[collaborative_space_exploration_efforts | collaborative space exploration efforts]] to achieve greater scientific understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## Launch and First Results

Europa Clipper was originally scheduled to launch on October 10, 2024, but faced delays due to Hurricane Milton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Distant observations, including searches for plumes, are expected to begin in 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. The first high-resolution data from the mission is anticipated in 2031 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

## Legacy and Impact

The Europa Clipper represents the culmination of over 26 years of planning and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. In the late 1990s, NASA even video-called Arthur C. Clarke to show him plans for a future mission to explore Europa's ocean world, receiving his permission to "land on Europa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This mission is a prime example of what can be achieved through ambitious goals and [[collaborative_space_exploration_efforts | collaborative efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

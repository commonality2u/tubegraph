From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

The danger posed by a falling object is often misunderstood, particularly regarding the role of **air resistance**. A common myth suggests that a penny dropped from a great height, like the Empire State Building, could be lethal upon impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Penny Experiment: Busting the Myth
A penny weighs around two and a half grams, which is about half to a quarter the weight of a bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. If [[physics_and_aerodynamic_principles | air resistance]] were ignored, a penny dropped from the Empire State Building (443 meters high) would accelerate to over 300 kilometers per hour by the time it hit the ground, roughly half the speed of a typical bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

To [[testing_and_experiments_with_kinetic_projectiles | test this myth]], Derek partnered with original MythBuster Adam Savage. While the MythBusters had previously used contraptions to shoot pennies at each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, they had never dropped pennies from a significant height onto a person below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. In this experiment, Adam dropped pennies from a helicopter onto Derek, who wore a helmet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. A complicating factor was the helicopter's downdraft, which was not accounted for in initial calculations for still air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Despite initial terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> and the sting of pennies hitting his shoulder and helmet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, the experiment concluded that a penny dropped from a height equivalent to the Empire State Building is **not dangerous** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. It might sting a little, but it's certainly not fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Why Pennies Aren't Deadly: The Role of Air Resistance

The primary reason pennies are not dangerous when dropped from a great height is **air resistance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

Consider the classic experiment of a hammer and feather dropped simultaneously:
*   **On the Moon**: In the near vacuum of the moon's surface, both objects accelerate at the same rate due to gravity and hit the ground at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **On Earth**: On Earth, the hammer lands significantly before the feather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The feather quickly reaches a constant speed, known as its **terminal velocity**, meaning it no longer speeds up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Understanding Terminal Velocity
**Terminal velocity** is achieved when the force of gravity pulling an object down is equal to the force of air resistance pushing it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Air resistance is proportional to the speed squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. While the hammer experiences a greater force of air resistance due to its much higher speed, its weight is so much greater that drag is negligible in comparison, allowing it to keep speeding up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The feather, however, reaches terminal velocity early because the ratio of its weight to air resistance is quickly balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Every object has its own terminal velocity, which is the maximum speed it will reach in free fall through still air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### [[Comparison of terminal velocity between different objects | Examples of Terminal Velocity]]
*   **Weight vs. Air Resistance**: Objects with the same size and shape experience the same air resistance, but a heavier object will have a higher terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Conversely, objects with vastly different sizes, shapes, and weights (like a person and a lacrosse ball) can have the same terminal velocity if the ratio of their weight to air resistance is the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

*   **Altitude and Air Density**: Air resistance is directly proportional to the density of the air an object moves through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    *   In 2012, Felix Baumgartner jumped from 39 kilometers above sea level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. In the thin air (60 times less dense than at sea level) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, he reached a terminal velocity of over 1300 kilometers per hour, breaking the sound barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. As he fell into thicker atmosphere, his terminal velocity decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

*   **Raindrops vs. Hail**:
    *   **Raindrops** have a low terminal velocity of just 25 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. They are typically spherical or slightly flattened on the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> and break up into smaller droplets if they get too big <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
    *   **Hail** can reach terminal velocities of over 200 kilometers per hour, about 10 times that of rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This is primarily because hailstones can grow much larger (up to 20 centimeters in diameter have been measured) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. While drag scales with radius squared, weight scales with radius cubed, so larger hailstones achieve faster terminal velocities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This increased mass at higher speed results in more kinetic energy and a bigger impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Hail causes injuries and fatalities each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Pennies and Terminal Velocity
Pennies reach their terminal velocity after falling only about 15 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This means that whether they are dropped from 15 meters or 3000 meters, they will hit the ground at the same speed and feel the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This is why the helicopter in the experiment did not need to reach Empire State Building height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

### The Peculiar Fall of Pennies
Pennies are also hard to aim because they flutter and tumble as they fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. A penny actually has two terminal velocities, oscillating between falling on its face and falling on its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This behavior was demonstrated in a custom wind tunnel built by Adam Savage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The oscillating movement within the wind tunnel, where wind speeds varied, allowed the penny to move up and down as it transitioned between these two states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

Ultimately, pennies aren't dangerous because their terminal velocity is at most about 80 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Other Falling Objects: Pens and Bullets

### Ballpoint Pens
Some suggest that ballpoint pens, being more aerodynamic, could be lethal when dropped from a skyscraper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. These pens weigh about twice as much as a penny and have a smaller cross-sectional area, which should increase their weight-to-drag ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

In a [[testing_and_experiments_with_kinetic_projectiles | test]] using a ballistics gel dummy instead of a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, plastic ballpoint pens were dropped from a helicopter. The results showed no significant impact, leading Adam Savage to conclude that pens are not dangerous falling from tall objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. These plastic pens still have too much drag relative to their weight to achieve a high terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Narrow metal pens, however, might still pose a danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

### Bullets
The term "bullet" originates from the French "boule" (ball), reflecting the spherical shape of early bullets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Modern bullet shapes are designed to reduce drag, moving from a drag coefficient of 0.5 for a sphere to between 0.1 and 0.3 for a modern bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

However, a surprising fact about dropping a bullet from a skyscraper is that it would likely tumble and fall on its side, rather than pointy-side down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Objects tend to fall in the orientation that presents the highest resistance, which is the most stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

When a bullet is fired straight up, it slows down as its kinetic energy converts to gravitational potential energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. At its highest point (up to three kilometers), it stops and then falls back down. In this fall, it tumbles, experiencing far more air resistance than on its ascent. Consequently, it reaches the ground much slower than it was shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

> [!NOTE] DANGER FROM ANGLED FIRES
> If a bullet is fired at an angle, it maintains its horizontal velocity and the spin imparted by the gun barrel keeps it moving pointy-end first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. This allows it to speed up to a significant fraction of its launch speed as it returns to the ground, posing a much greater danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. This is why celebratory gunfire, though accidental, has resulted in hundreds of deaths worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## Historical and Modern Kinetic Projectiles

The concept of dropping deadly projectiles from the sky is almost as old as aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

*   **Fléchettes (WWI)**: In World War I, small metal darts called fléchettes (French for "little arrow") were dropped from planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. These projectiles, some up to 15 centimeters long, had feathers to ensure a straight fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. They were cheap to produce and deploy, did not require explosives, and could pierce helmets, causing nasty injuries and even passing through a rider and his horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

*   **Lazy Dogs (Korean & Vietnam Wars)**: Later, the US developed similar, heftier weapons called Lazy Dogs, used in the Korean and Vietnam wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. While their damage was indiscriminate, they had the advantage of not leaving unexploded ordnance in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

Militaries continue to use [[the_role_of_kinetic_weapons_in_science_fiction | kinetic projectiles]] for precision strikes today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

## Dangers in Civilian Life

Falling objects are a significant danger in civilian life, causing nearly 700 American deaths annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. These incidents range from:
*   Loose tiles and bricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>
*   Falling construction tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>
*   Falling rocks and tree branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>
*   Icicles, which can pose serious threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

## Conclusion: Lethal vs. Non-Lethal Projectiles

The lethality of a falling object largely depends on its **kinetic energy** upon impact. The lower limit for fracturing a human skull is around 68 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

*   A raindrop at terminal velocity delivers only about 0.002 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   A falling penny has about 0.2 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   A baseball or the largest hailstones can deliver over 80 Joules, which is plenty to crack a skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

It's also important to consider the force applied to a small area, which can cause damage even if the total kinetic energy isn't high enough to fracture a skull. For example, the energy in a falling fléchette isn't enough to crack a skull, but it can cause significant injury by applying a large force to a very small point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

In summary:
*   A penny falling from the Empire State Building won't kill you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   A plastic pen likely won't either <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
*   Anything that weighs a few grams and isn't aerodynamic isn't going to be fatal due to its low terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.
*   However, objects weighing more than a few hundred grams traveling at terminal velocity are likely to be deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

Radiation is a natural part of our environment, but certain types can be frightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. [[types_and_effects_of_ionizing_radiation | Ionizing radiation]] is radiation with enough energy to rip electrons off atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It is measured in Sieverts (Sv) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. An acute exposure of more than 2 Sieverts is likely fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. We are constantly exposed to low levels of [[types_and_effects_of_ionizing_radiation | ionizing radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Everyday and Natural Sources

*   **Bananas**: Bananas are rich in potassium, and some of this potassium is naturally radioactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Eating a banana exposes you to about 0.1 microSieverts (µSv) of [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, which is 1/10 millionth of a Sievert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Sleeping next to someone**: Because people become radioactive from their diet, sleeping next to another person exposes you to more [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | radiation]] than sleeping alone, though this dose is insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Natural Background Radiation**: [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | Ionizing radiation]] naturally comes from the soil, rocks, air, and even from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   The level in Sydney, Australia, is about 0.15 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   Globally, average levels are typically between 0.1 and 0.2 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Historical and Industrial Sites

*   **[[historical_nuclear_sites_and_their_current_radiation_levels | Hiroshima Peace Dome]]**: Approximately 70 years after the first nuclear bomb detonation over a city, the [[historical_nuclear_sites_and_their_current_radiation_levels | radiation]] level here is only 0.3 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **[[historical_nuclear_sites_and_their_current_radiation_levels | Uranium Mine]] (Jáchymov, Czech Republic)**: This old uranium mine, where uranium was discovered and Marie Curie obtained her raw material, has a [[historical_nuclear_sites_and_their_current_radiation_levels | radiation]] level of 17 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This is about 10 times the natural background [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **[[historical_nuclear_sites_and_their_current_radiation_levels | Marie Curie's Lab]]**: Only a few parts of Marie Curie's lab are still radioactive. The doorknob measures around 10 times the background level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, and alpha particles can still be detected off the back of her chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, likely from traces of radium left after working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **[[historical_nuclear_sites_and_their_current_radiation_levels | Trinity Bomb Test Site]] (New Mexico, USA)**: Where the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated, the general [[historical_nuclear_sites_and_their_current_radiation_levels | radiation]] level is about 8 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The fused desert sand, called trinitite, is slightly more radioactive, with readings of 2 to 3 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Travel and Altitude

*   **Airplane Travel**: As altitude increases, there is less atmosphere to shield from [[impact_of_cosmic_rays_on_avionics_and_supercomputers | cosmic rays]], leading to higher [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation exposure]].
    *   18,000 feet: up to 0.5 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
    *   23,000 feet: up to 1 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
    *   33,000 feet: over 2 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   Even higher altitudes and towards the poles: over 3 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Nuclear Disaster Sites

*   **[[historical_nuclear_sites_and_their_current_radiation_levels | Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor #4]] (Ukraine)**: The site of the 1986 meltdown currently reads around 5 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. One hour of exposure here is similar to a dental x-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Radiation levels are lower because meters of topsoil were removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **[[historical_nuclear_sites_and_their_current_radiation_levels | Fukushima Exclusion Zone]] (Japan)**: Following the 2011 accident, [[historical_nuclear_sites_and_their_current_radiation_levels | radiation]] levels inside the exclusion zone range from 5 to 10 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Although the initial release was about 10% of Chernobyl's, it is "fresher," so less has decayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Authorities are removing meters of topsoil similar to Chernobyl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Pripyat Hospital Basement (Chernobyl)**: This is one of the most radioactive places on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Firemen's contaminated clothing from the 1986 disaster was left in the basement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Readings just outside the door reached 500 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, and inside the basement, it could reach 1,500 µSv per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. One hour in the basement would result in a dose of 2,000 µSv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, equivalent to a year's worth of natural background [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Medical and Occupational Exposure

*   **CT Scan**: A patient receives approximately 7,000 µSv, which is equivalent to 3 years of natural background [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Fukushima Residents (estimated)**: People living around Fukushima are estimated to receive an additional 10,000 µSv over their lifetime due to the nuclear disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Radiation Workers**: Radiation workers are limited to a maximum of 50,000 µSv per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Astronauts**: An astronaut on the International Space Station for 6 months will receive about 80,000 µSv of [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Highest Levels of Exposure

*   **Smoker's Lungs**: A smoker's lungs on average receive 160,000 µSv worth of [[health_risks_associated_with_smoking_and_radiation_exposure | radiation]] every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This is due to radioactive polonium and lead present in tobacco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This makes the ordinary average smoker the individual who receives the highest doses of [[health_risks_associated_with_smoking_and_radiation_exposure | ionizing radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

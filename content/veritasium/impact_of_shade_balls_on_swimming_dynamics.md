[[Swimming in shade balls | Swimming in shade balls]], particularly in large quantities, presents unique challenges and effects due to their physical properties and behavior in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While [[purpose_of_shade_balls_in_reservoirs | shade balls]] are primarily used in drinking reservoirs where swimming is prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, experimental trials demonstrate the specific dynamics involved.

The manufacturer of [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] advises against swimming due to safety concerns, regularly refusing requests from residential customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Physical Properties of Shade Balls

What makes [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] inherently more dangerous than other plastic balls is that they are half-full of water, making them heavy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. For instance, a bag of 1,200 [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] weighs 300 kilograms (660 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. When fully submerged, each individual ball only supports approximately 300 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## Swimming in a Single Layer of Shade Balls

When a pool is covered with a single layer of [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]], they tend to arrange themselves in close-packed crystal structures with boundaries between these "grains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Swimming in a single layer provides a sensation akin to being in a ball pit, though with an underlying quicksand-like feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It is possible to swim using strokes like breaststroke or front crawl, but it is difficult and feels like getting knocked around in a "rock tumbler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Swimmers encounter many balls hitting their face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

The presence of the balls creates significant resistance, akin to an "extra workout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This resistance is due to increased drag, which is the force opposing motion through a fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If the [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] are imagined as particles of their own fluid, drag becomes proportional to the swimmer's velocity squared (VÂ²) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This is because faster movement means encountering more balls per second, and those balls are moving faster relative to the swimmer, leading to a greater impact as they are pushed out of the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

The butterfly stroke is particularly challenging as it requires pushing the balls not only forward but also down, up, and out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Additionally, the constant movement of the balls produces significant noise close to the swimmer's head, making it virtually impossible to hear anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Swimming in Multi-Layer Shade Balls

Swimming in [[challenges_of_swimming_in_multi_layer_shade_balls | multi-layer shade balls]], which is how most of the LA reservoir is covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, proves to be significantly more difficult than in a single layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

It is generally not possible to swim effectively in multiple layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Attempts to run or slide across the surface inevitably result in sinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. To float entirely above the water, a person would need more than 260 [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] trapped directly underneath them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

While floating gently on the surface is possible if completely still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, any movement causes the balls to shift, leading to sinking deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Unlike in a single layer, where balls can easily move past each other, in multiple layers, they become trapped against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This behavior causes them to act more like a solid, providing significantly greater resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. An unorthodox style of swimming, mostly beneath the [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]], was found to be the only way to achieve any movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

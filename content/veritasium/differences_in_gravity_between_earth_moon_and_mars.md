Gravity varies significantly between celestial bodies, impacting human movement, physiology, and daily activities.

## Earth's Gravity
Life on Earth has evolved under a consistent gravitational force of approximately 9.8 m/sÂ² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. This means a person's arm typically weighs about 5% of their body weight, making everyday movements like lifting an arm a minor workout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

## Martian Gravity
On Mars, the gravity is only about 37% of Earth's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This reduced gravity would allow an average jumper on Earth to achieve double the airtime and easily dunk on a regulation basketball hoop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. However, the low gravity also makes it difficult to exercise, as typical movements provide less resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Wearing a spacesuit, which can weigh up to 310 pounds, would make a person feel about as heavy as they are on Earth, potentially aiding in maintaining muscle and bone mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

## Lunar Gravity
The Moon's gravity is even weaker, at just 1/6 of Earth's gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This allows for extensive "crazy aerobics" without quick exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## Microgravity (Zero-G)
A journey to Mars would expose astronauts to approximately eight months of microgravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. This environment can be simulated on Earth using a "vomit comet," a plane that flies in a series of parabolic arcs to create brief periods of freefall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. Each simulated microgravity period lasts about 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

### [[effects_of_microgravity_on_the_human_body | Effects of Microgravity on the Human Body]]
*   **Muscle Atrophy:** Without gravity, muscles weaken and shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Studies show muscle mass can decrease by up to 20% on space flights lasting only 5 to 11 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Bone Density Loss:** The lack of weight pushing on bones leads to a decrease in bone density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Astronauts can lose 1-2% of bone mass per month, primarily in their lower extremities, a rate over 10 times faster than bone loss experienced by people with osteoporosis on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Nausea:** Human bodies are not evolved for different gravity situations, often leading to nausea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

### [[challenges_of_microgravity_in_space_travel | Challenges of Microgravity in Space Travel]]
*   **Exercise Limitations:** Traditional weightlifting is useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, so astronauts rely on elastic resistance. For instance, on the space station, astronauts are elastically tethered to a treadmill and exercise typically two and a half hours every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Liquid Management:** In weightless conditions, other forces like surface tension become significant, making everyday activities such as washing your face, showering, brushing teeth, and going to the bathroom much harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Rotational Dynamics:** Objects behave differently in microgravity. A spinning disc, for example, demonstrates the intermediate axis theorem, where rotation about an intermediate axis is unstable and will cause it to flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. This [[implications_of_the_dzhanibekov_effect_for_planetary_rotation | Dzhanibekov effect]] has also been observed on the space station with a t-bar handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
*   **Radiation Exposure:** During a trip to Mars, astronauts would be exposed to significant amounts of radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, which can cause flashes of light even with eyes closed, thought to be heavy particles or energy bursts passing through the eyeball or optic nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Radiation can be shielded using insulation in the ship or water, which is an excellent radiation absorber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

## Future Implications
Overcoming these [[space_exploration_challenges | challenges of space exploration]] is crucial for humanity to become a multiplanetary species and ensure long-term survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. If humans were to permanently live on Mars, their evolution might take very different directions, adapting to the lower gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

Shade balls are small, black plastic spheres deployed in large water reservoirs, notably 96 million of them in the Los Angeles Reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. While often misunderstood as primarily for evaporation reduction, their main purpose is to address critical water quality issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Water Quality Benefits

### Preventing Bromate Formation
The primary reason for deploying shade balls in the LA Reservoir was to prevent the formation of Bromate, a carcinogenic compound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

*   **The Problem**: Bromide is a naturally occurring substance found in source water, which is harmless and difficult to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. However, when Bromide in water interacts with chlorine (used for disinfection) and bright sunlight in an open reservoir, it forms Bromate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This discovery was made when a beverage company reported high Bromate levels in water downstream from the reservoir, despite initial tests at the filtration plant showing safe levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **The Solution**: Since removing Bromide, chlorine, or sunlight were the only options, removing sunlight was deemed the most viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. Experiments using kiddie pools demonstrated that shade balls immediately solved the Bromate problem by blocking sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. The black color of the shade balls is crucial for blocking all light from reaching the water and triggering this reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. This represents a key aspect of [[the_science_behind_shade_balls | the science behind shade balls]].

### Algae Control
Shade balls significantly improve water quality by controlling algae growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

*   **The Problem**: In open reservoirs, algae growth was a persistent issue, sometimes causing a slight green tinge in the water, even if safe to drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. Significant amounts of chlorine were historically used to control this algae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
*   **The Solution**: By blocking sunlight, shade balls eliminate the conditions necessary for algae to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. This has virtually eliminated the need for chlorine to control algae in the LA Reservoir, leading to substantial chemical savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

## Evaporation Reduction

While not their primary purpose, shade balls significantly reduce water evaporation from reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

*   **Mechanism**:
    *   **Reduced Surface Area**: Shade balls cover the water's surface, reducing the exposed area where water molecules can escape into the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Reduced Air Flow**: They minimize air flow over the water's surface, preventing the continuous removal of moist air layers and their replacement with dryer air, which would otherwise increase evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.
    *   **Thermal Insulation**: Despite being black and absorbing more energy on top, the bottom of the balls remains cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. The balls are partially filled with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a> and mostly contain air, which acts as a good thermal insulator, similar to a double-paned window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. This prevents heat transfer to the water.
    *   **Cooling Effect**: Measurements have shown that the water under the shade balls is actually cooler than water in an open reservoir without balls, indicating a slight cooling effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.
*   **Result**: For these reasons, shade balls reduce evaporation by 80 to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>, which is highly beneficial for arid climates like Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

## Design and Cost-Effectiveness

*   **Material and Durability**: Shade balls are made from high-density polyethylene, a food-grade plastic also used for milk jugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. The black color is due to "carbon black," a material that ensures the plastic lasts for at least 10 years in sunlight, as other colors like blue were found to be unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. They are designed to be totally inert and safe for contact with drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.
*   **Stability**: The balls are partially filled with water to make them heavier and prevent them from being blown away by high winds, which could otherwise lead to them bouncing onto freeways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **Shape**: The spherical shape is crucial as it prevents them from stacking up or perching on the reservoir banks as water levels fluctuate. Other proposed shapes, like hexagonal ones, did not offer this flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Shade balls cost around 33-34 cents per piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. Over their lifespan, the savings from reduced chlorination and evaporation are estimated to offset at least half of their cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>, in addition to the immeasurable [[purpose_of_shade_balls_in_reservoirs | water quality benefit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
*   **Navigation**: The density of the shade balls makes it very difficult to navigate a boat through them, often compared to driving through peanut butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>, affecting the [[impact_of_shade_balls_on_swimming_dynamics | swimming dynamics]] of any vessel.

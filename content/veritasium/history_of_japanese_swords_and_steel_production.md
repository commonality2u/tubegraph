Japanese swords are renowned for their strength and sharpness, capable of slicing a bullet in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The traditional method of making these [[traditional_japanese_sword_making_process | swords]] has remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years, with everything done by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. They are still considered among the best in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The Japanese developed a [[history_and_development_of_kinetic_energy_weapons | weapon]] that was the pinnacle for their style of warfare and available materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Such is their regard that a 16th-century sword was appraised at $105 million, making it the most expensive sword ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Early History of Sword Making in Japan

Sword making in Japan dates back approximately 3,000 years, with early [[traditional_japanese_sword_making_process | swords]] being made from bronze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The discovery of metal smelting is thought to be related to pottery, where metallic beads might have been found in kilns used for glazes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Bronze, an [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | alloy]] of copper and tin, was discovered before [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] due to its lower melting points, allowing it to be smelted in regular pottery kilns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. However, bronze, while sharpenable, is too soft to hold an edge for long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Japanese sword makers shifted to [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] about 1,200 years ago during the Heian period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The curved blade commonly recognized as a Japanese sword is characteristic of this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Sourcing Raw Materials

[[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | Steel]] is an [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | alloy]] of [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]], the fourth-most common element in Earth's crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Most of the world's [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] supply comes from banded [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] formations, which are sedimentary rock layers with high concentrations of [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] oxide (up to 60% by weight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. These layers formed from [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] precipitating out of ancient oceans due to oxygen produced by cyanobacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

Japan's mostly volcanic geology means it has very few of these sedimentary [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] oxides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This likely contributed to Japan being late to [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] production, with [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] artifacts in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) dating back nearly 4,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Until the 8th century, Japan imported metals, including [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]], from China and Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Japanese [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] production began using [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Igneous rocks contain [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] oxides in lower concentrations, but as mountains weather, these oxides break apart and wash downstream, becoming part of the sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Japanese artisans noticed that denser [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] oxides accumulate where rivers change direction or speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. To amplify this, they created diversions in rivers, achieving [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] sands with up to 80% [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] oxides by weight, which is more concentrated and has fewer impurities than high-quality [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] ore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## The Tatara Method of Steel Production

The Tatara method, used in the Shimane province of Japan, is a traditional [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]]-making process that has remained consistent for 1,300 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This method is the only way to produce the [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] used in the very best Japanese swords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Smelting Process

The smelter is lit only once a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The process begins after 9:00 AM with ceremonial prayers and the fire lit by a Shinto priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Workers remain at the smelter for at least 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Heating [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] oxides to over 1,250 degrees Celsius breaks the bonds with oxygen, yielding pure [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. However, pure [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] is softer than bronze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The solution lies in adding [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | carbon]] to [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]], which creates the incredibly strong [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | alloy]]: [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | carbon]] is supplied by charcoal, which is primarily pure [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | carbon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

> [!info] Alloys
> [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | Alloys]] are generally stronger than pure metals because their different-sized atoms reduce the ability of atoms to slide past each other under external force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

The [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] sand is mixed with water to prevent it from flying up when added to the flame; however, too much water can cause the kiln to explode due to steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This mixing is done by feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Charcoal and [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] sand are continuously added to the smelter over many hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. To achieve the high temperatures (up to 1,500 degrees Celsius) required for [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] making, a strong, steady supply of oxygen is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Historically, this was provided by huge foot-operated bellows, requiring around-the-clock effort from many men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Modern smelters use electric bellows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

The temperature inside the smelter, just below [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]]'s melting point of 1,538Â°C, softens the [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] enough to clump into a large block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Impurities like sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon oxides combine with [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | carbon]] from the charcoal, melting at a lower temperature than [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] and flowing to the bottom as slag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Slag is periodically removed, often after another prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

After about 21 hours of smelting, which involves adding charcoal and [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] sand and removing impurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, the process is complete by 9:00 AM the next morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. A total of 614 kilograms of [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] sand and 670 kilograms of charcoal are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The result is a 100-kilogram block of [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]], [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]], and slag, known as kamagane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Only about a third of this block is high-quality enough for sword making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

The [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] is then sorted by quality and [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | carbon]] content, a skill typically done by eye and part of the examination to become a certified swordsmith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

## Forging the Sword

The sorted [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] is sent to one of about 300 swordsmiths across Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Akihara Kokaji is an example of a master swordsmith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### The Forging Process

The forging begins with heating the [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] in a coal oven with hand-pumped bellows until it is soft and malleable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The master swordsmith then flattens the [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] using hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Traditionally, this involved the swordsmith and three apprentices, with the master setting the rhythm for the apprentices to use large mallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Today, electric hammers are often used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

Once flattened, the [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] is bent back on itself and hammered again to press it into a solid block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. This folding process is crucial:
1.  **Spreading Impurities:** It evenly distributes impurities like silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus throughout the [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]], ensuring uniform consistency and preventing weak points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
2.  **Creating Grain:** The folding reinforces the sword in the direction it will be hit in combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
3.  **Aesthetic Patterns:** Exposure to air during folding causes slight oxidation, creating darker [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] that forms beautiful patterns when folded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

Each fold doubles the number of layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. While some [[traditional_japanese_sword_making_process | swords]] can have over a billion layers (requiring only about 30 folds), most are folded 10 to 13 times, resulting in a few thousand layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

### Differential Hardening

A blade is not made from a single block of [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] because [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | carbon]] content dictates hardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | Carbon]] atoms, being smaller than [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] atoms, fit inside the crystal lattice of [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]], creating stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Higher [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | carbon]] content results in harder, more rigid [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]], but also makes it more brittle and prone to chipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

Swordsmiths use different [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | carbon]] contents for various parts of the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. The edge is always high-carbon [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] for sharpness and rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. The spine is typically lower-carbon [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]], allowing the sword to flex without breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. This is achieved by welding together pieces of [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] with varying [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | carbon]] contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

### Quenching and the Hamon

After being hammered into a straight blade, the sword is covered in a layer of clay: thick on the spine and thin on the blade edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. It is then heated in a furnace and rapidly cooled (quenched) in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. The differing clay thicknesses cause the edge to cool faster than the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

> [!note] Material Science of Quenching
> When [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] is heated, [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | carbon]] enters the [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] lattice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
>
> *   **Spine:** The thick clay causes slow cooling, allowing [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | carbon]] atoms to leave the [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] matrix. This forms ferrite (very low-carbon [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]]) and cementite (where [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | carbon]] atoms are caught by other [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] atoms). The combination, known as perlite, is mostly soft and ductile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
> *   **Edge:** The thin clay layer leads to rapid cooling, trapping more [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | carbon]] in the lattice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. This forces the lattice structure to change from cubic to tetragonal, forming martensite, an incredibly hard type of [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. The trapped [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | carbon]] stresses the lattice, and the tetragonal structure takes up more space, causing the blade's edge to expand relative to the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. This expansion curves the sword backward, creating the iconic curve of a samurai sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

The boundary between these different types of [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | steel]] is visible as a color difference in the finished sword, known as *hamon* (edge pattern) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. About one-third of all blades shatter during this quenching process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

After quenching, the sword is briefly placed back in the forge to evaporate remaining water and to temper the blade by loosening some crystal structures, making it less brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Japanese swords maintain a much harder edge than Western swords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

## Finishing Touches and Legacy

After forging, the sword is sent to a polisher. The polishing and sharpening are done by hand using whetstones of different coarsenesses, a process that can take up to a month for a single sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. Occasionally, swords are also engraved with beautiful patterns, though this is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

> "Before I made this video, I didn't really appreciate that [[traditional_japanese_sword_making_process | swords]] can be art." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a> The meticulous care, attention to detail, and expertise at each step, from gathering [[material_science_behind_japanese_swords | iron]] sand to smelting, forging, and sharpening, are what make these artifacts of such high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

The practical application of these [[traditional_japanese_sword_making_process | swords]] is exemplified by figures like Miyamoto Musashi, a legendary samurai and 10th-generation student of a master, who perfected his sword-fighting techniques, including a two-sword style, and won over 60 duels to the death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. A story tells of Musashi holding his katana so still during a snowstorm that snowflakes accumulated on its thin edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

The deep care, attention to detail, and love for the craft involved in making Japanese swords highlight how dedication can produce something beautiful and enduring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

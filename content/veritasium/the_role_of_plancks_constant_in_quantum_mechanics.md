The concept of a single, well-defined trajectory for every object, even at the quantum level, is a significant misconception in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. In reality, everything explores all possible paths simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The fact that we observe single, well-defined trajectories is described as nature's most convincing illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This phenomenon can be explained by a quantity called [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### The Principle of Least Action
The idea of [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]] was first proposed by Maupertuis, who defined it as mass times velocity times distance, stating that everything always follows the path that minimizes this quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Hamilton later showed that this [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]] is equivalent to the integral over time of kinetic energy minus potential energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Historically, [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]] was a useful alternative for solving physics problems, especially when Newton's laws became too cumbersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Birth of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | Quantum Mechanics]]
Around the turn of the 20th century, [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]] became central to the scientific revolution that led to the birth of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This began with the problem of blackbody radiation, driven by Germany's desire to replace gas street lights with electric light bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Scientists studied how much light different materials emitted as a function of temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. They found that above 500°C, all materials glowed similarly, with an almost identical distribution of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

A theoretical model for a "perfect blackbody" (a hole in a metal cube) was developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Theorists reasoned that electrons in the walls would emit electromagnetic waves, forming standing waves inside the cavity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The total number of these modes was proportional to frequency cubed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This led to the Rayleigh-Jeans law, which matched experimental data at longer wavelengths but predicted an infinite amount of energy at shorter wavelengths, known as the "ultraviolet catastrophe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

#### Planck's Breakthrough
Max Planck, despite being advised that physics was a complete science, struggled for three years to find a theoretical explanation for blackbody radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. In an "act of desperation," he introduced a radical idea: the energy of an electromagnetic wave could only come in discrete multiples of a smallest amount, a "quantum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. He defined this energy as directly proportional to its frequency: E = hf, where 'h' is **Planck's constant** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

This quantization explained the blackbody spectrum:
*   For low-frequency radiation, the energy (hf) of one quantum is small, so most atoms have enough energy to emit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   At higher frequencies, the energy of a quantum increases, and fewer atoms have enough energy to emit that wavelength, causing the spectrum to fall and eventually drop to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

Planck's formula perfectly matched experimental data by tuning 'h' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. However, he was troubled by this, seeing it initially as a mathematical trick with no clear physical meaning for 'h' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. After strenuous work, he realized that **Planck's constant** (h) has the units of [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]] and represents a "quantum of [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. He proposed that any change in nature would occur in whole multiples of this quantum of [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

#### Einstein and Bohr Extend Quantization
**Planck's constant** gained little attention until Albert [[Einsteins_theory_of_relativity | Einstein]] in 1905 claimed that Planck's theory implied light actually comes in discrete packets, or photons, each with energy E=hf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This insight explained the photoelectric effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

Eight years later, Niels Bohr used quantization to understand the stability of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. He realized that an electron's angular momentum (mass times velocity times radius) has the same units as [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Bohr ad-hoc discretized the orbital angular momentum into multiples of h-bar (nh/2π, where h-bar is **Planck's constant** divided by 2π) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This arbitrary quantization successfully predicted the correct energy levels of the hydrogen atom and reproduced its spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

#### De Broglie's Hypothesis and Wave-Particle Duality
The lack of a physical reason for Bohr's quantization was solved by Louis [[de_broglies_hypothesis_and_waveparticle_duality | de Broglie]] 11 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Inspired by light's [[wave_particle_duality | wave-particle duality]], [[de_broglies_hypothesis_and_waveparticle_duality | de Broglie]] proposed that matter particles, like electrons, are also waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. He defined their wavelength as **Planck's constant** divided by their momentum (mass times velocity): λ = h/mv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

This [[de_broglies_hypothesis_and_waveparticle_duality | de Broglie]] wavelength provided a physical reason for Bohr's quantization: for an electron to remain bound in an atom, it must exist as a standing wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. This requires a whole number of wavelengths to fit around the circumference of the orbit (2πr = nλ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Substituting [[de_broglies_hypothesis_and_waveparticle_duality | de Broglie]]'s expression for wavelength into this condition directly yields Bohr's quantized angular momentum condition (mvr = nh/2π) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. This demonstrated that the wave nature of quantum objects means they no longer have a single path through space, but rather explore all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

### [[feynmans_path_integral_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics | Feynman's Path Integral Formulation]]
Richard Feynman's approach to [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanics]] suggests that anything moving from one point to another is connected in every possible way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. This insight, which applies to photons, electrons, and even macroscopic objects, means we must include *all* possible paths in our calculations, even "crazy" ones that go faster than light, back in time, or to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

In [[feynmans_path_integral_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics | Feynman's formulation]], each path is weighted equally, and the observed outcome arises from summing their amplitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. The "stopwatch" for each path measures something called "phase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. The increase in phase along a path is directly related to the [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]] taken by that path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. Mathematically, the amplitude is given by `e^(i * phase)`, where the phase is proportional to the [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]] divided by **Planck's constant** (or h-bar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

#### Why We See Classical Paths
**Planck's constant** (h-bar) is incredibly tiny, about 10^-34 joule-seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. For everyday objects, their [[misconceptions_in_classical_paths_versus_quantum_paths | action]] is vastly larger than h-bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. This means that for any path not near the [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | path of least action]], the phase spins around zillions of times, pointing in some random direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. When these phases are added up, they destructively interfere and cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

The only exception is for paths extremely close to the [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | path of least action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>. For these paths, tiny changes in the path result in negligible changes to the [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]], so their phases point in basically the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. This causes them to constructively interfere, leading to the "classical" trajectory we observe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. This mechanism explains how [[misconceptions_in_classical_paths_versus_quantum_paths | classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

For macroscopic objects, the [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]] is so large compared to h-bar that only paths extremely close to the true [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | path of least action]] "survive" due to constructive interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>, making them appear very particle-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. For smaller particles like electrons or photons, the [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | actions]] are much smaller relative to h-bar, leading to a wider spread of possible trajectories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

An experiment using a diffraction grating demonstrates this: by cleverly covering parts of a mirror, light can be made to reflect in "crazy" directions, which normally destructively interfere, proving that these other paths are indeed explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

### Significance
**Planck's constant** and the concept of [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]] are fundamental to modern physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. Theoretical physicists often discuss [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | action]] rather than energy or forces, as it provides a single mathematical framework—the Lagrangian—from which the laws of physics can be derived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. The hunt for a "theory of everything" is, in essence, the search for the correct Lagrangian that can generate all laws of physics in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.

The Great Pyramid stood as the tallest man-made structure for nearly 4,000 years, only being surpassed by the Eiffel Tower in 1889 by a significant margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. What makes these structures even more remarkable is that they were built over 4,500 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, presenting immense [[history_of_pyramid_construction | engineering challenges]] given the available technology of the time.

## Limitations in Ancient Egyptian Technology

A significant challenge faced by the ancient Egyptians was the absence of modern tools and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **No Wheels or Steel** The Egyptians did not possess wheels or steel during the construction of the pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Copper as the Primary Metal** The only metal available for tools was copper and its alloys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This directly impacted the [[materials_and_techniques_used_in_building_pyramids | materials and techniques used in building pyramids]].

## Scale of Construction

The sheer scale of the Great Pyramid highlights the magnitude of the [[materials_and_techniques_used_in_building_pyramids | construction effort]]:
*   **Number of Stones** Approximately 2 million stones were used to build one pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Stone Weight** These "giant rocks" typically weighed between 1.5 and 3 tons each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Construction Duration** Each pyramid took about 20 to 30 years to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Considering the number of stones, this would have required laying a stone roughly once every three minutes during a 10-12 hour workday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Unraveling the Construction Methods

No definitive plans survive detailing how the pyramids were built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, leading to many theories and [[myths_and_misconceptions_about_pyramid_builders | misconceptions about pyramid builders]]. However, archaeological findings and engineering insights offer plausible explanations for how these feats were accomplished.

### Moving Massive Stones

Without wheels, the movement of stones across the desert was a major challenge.
*   **Sleds and Wet Sand** Stones were likely carted on sleds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. A famous diagram depicts a giant 68-ton statue being pulled by 172 men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. To reduce friction, the sand in front of the sled was wetted, which experiments have shown can reduce the required pulling force by half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Transportation by Water** For stones quarried far away, like the granite from Aswan (nearly 1,000 km from Giza), flooding of the Nile River was crucial. The floodwaters would extend to the quarries, allowing stones to be loaded onto rafts and floated downstream to Giza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Stone Cutting and Shaping

The internal stones of the pyramid are primarily softer limestone, easier to work with copper chisels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Copper Saws and Abrasives** Some blocks might have been sawn using copper saws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. While copper alone can't cut rock, adding an abrasive like sand would allow it to wear away the stone, though it would be a very difficult and labor-intensive process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Granite Quarrying** The outer casing of the pyramids was made of much harder granite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Granite contains quartz, which has a hardness of about seven on a scale where diamond is ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The technique for quarrying granite involved repeatedly smashing a harder dolerite rock into the granite, achieving a progress of only about 5 mm per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Leveling the Ground

Building a pyramid requires an extremely level foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. It is speculated that when the Nile flooded, channels were used to bring floodwater to the site, which would indicate the high parts of the ground needing to be leveled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Lifting and Placing Stones

While there is no clear account, the best guess for lifting stones is the use of ramps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Some ramps have even been found on incomplete pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Ramp Design** A single straight ramp would be impractical as it would require more material than the pyramid itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. A ramp that wraps around the pyramid is considered the most likely method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Levers for Upper Sections** The top third of the pyramid accounts for only about 4% of its total material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32] discriminator="main_topic"</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. It is suspected that levers were used to finish off the upper levels of the pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Original Appearance and Significance

While the pyramids have weathered over millennia, they originally appeared much different, showcasing the [[visual_and_cultural_significance_of_pyramids | visual and cultural significance of pyramids]]. They would have been a brighter white, covered in a white limestone casing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The very top may have been covered with electrum, a mixture of gold and silver, creating a spectacular sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Their shape was designed to represent sun rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

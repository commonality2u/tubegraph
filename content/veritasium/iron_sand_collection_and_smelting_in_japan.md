Japanese swords are renowned for their strength and sharpness, capable of slicing a bullet in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The method of making these swords has remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years, with everything done by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. They are still considered among the best in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The foundation of a high-quality Japanese sword begins with the meticulous process of gathering iron sand and smelting it using the traditional Tatara method.

## Historical Context and Iron Sourcing
Sword making in Japan dates back about 3000 years, with early swords made out of bronze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Bronze, an alloy of copper and tin, has a low melting point, allowing it to be smelted in regular pottery kilns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. However, bronze is too soft to hold a sharp edge for long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Japanese sword makers transitioned to steel 1200 years ago, during the Heian period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Japan's mostly volcanic geology means it has very few of the sedimentary iron oxides found globally in banded iron formations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, which account for the majority of the world's iron supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This is likely why Japan was late to steel production compared to places like Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), where steel artifacts nearly 4,000 years old have been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Up until the eighth century, metals, including steel, were imported into Japan from China and Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Iron Sand Collection
Given the lack of traditional iron ore deposits, the Japanese developed a unique method of collecting iron from their natural environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Igneous rocks like granite and diorite contain iron oxides, albeit in lower concentrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. As mountains weather, these iron oxides break apart and are washed downstream, eventually becoming part of the sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

The Japanese observed that iron oxides are denser than other minerals in sand and thus accumulate in areas where a river's direction or speed changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. To enhance this natural process, they deliberately created diversions in rivers, damming off sections and dragging sand into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The heavier iron would sink to the bottom, while lighter materials were washed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This method allows for the collection of iron sands with up to 80% iron oxides by weight, a concentration higher than most high-quality iron ore, and with fewer impurities, making it an excellent source for steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## The Tatara Smelting Method
The Tatara method, practiced in the Shimane province of Japan, is a smelting process where steel is made in the same way it was 1300 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This specific method produces the steel used in the very best Japanese swords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Process and Materials
The smelting process begins with ceremonial prayers and the lighting of the fire by a Shinto priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The workers involved remain at the smelter for at least 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

To achieve the necessary temperatures for steel production, a strong, steady supply of oxygen is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Historically, this was provided by huge foot-operated bellows, requiring continuous effort from many men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Today, electric bellows are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

The core of the process involves heating iron oxides to over 1,250 degrees Celsius to break the bonds with oxygen and yield pure iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Pure iron, however, is softer than bronze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The key to steel lies in the addition of carbon. Charcoal, which is pure carbon, is used as the heat source because it can reach the required high temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Adding a small amount of carbon to iron creates steel, an incredibly strong alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Alloys are stronger because different-sized atoms reduce the ability of atoms to slide past each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

The iron sand is mixed with water before being added to the flame to prevent it from flying straight up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The amount of water is determined by feel; too much water can cause the kiln to explode due to steam buildup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

Throughout the process, charcoal and iron sand are continuously added. For example, over a few hours, 250 kilograms of charcoal and nearly 60 kilograms of iron sand can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The temperature inside the smelter reaches up to 1500 degrees Celsius, just below the melting point of iron (1538 Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This keeps the iron soft and malleable, allowing it to clump into a large block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Slag Removal
Despite the high quality of iron sand, impurities like sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon oxides will always be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. These impurities combine with carbon from the charcoal and melt at a lower temperature than iron, forming a liquid byproduct known as slag, which flows to the bottom of the smelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. After many hours of adding materials, slag is periodically removed, a process preceded by another prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### The Bloom
After approximately 21 hours of smelting, totaling around 614 kilograms of iron sand and 670 kilograms of charcoal, the process is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Traditionally, the smelter would be broken apart to extract the steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Today, a crane is used to dismantle the smelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

The result is a 100-kilogram block of steel, iron, and slag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, known as a bloom. Only about a third of this bloom is of high enough quality to be used in [[traditional_japanese_sword_making_process|sword making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The steel is then sorted by quality and carbon content, a skill traditionally done by eye and part of the swordsmith certification exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This sorted steel is then sent to one of Japan's approximately 300 swordsmiths to begin the forging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

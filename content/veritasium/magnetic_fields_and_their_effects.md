Magnetic fields are invisible forces that can have profound effects on various materials, from attracting ferromagnetic objects to levitating non-magnetic ones. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (MagLab) in Tallahassee, Florida, is home to the [[worlds_strongest_magnet | world's strongest magnet]], holding the Guinness World Record for the strongest continuous magnetic field since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Measuring Magnetic Field Strength

Magnetic field strength is measured in Tesla. To provide context:
*   Earth's magnetic field: 0.00005 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   Fridge magnet: around 0.01 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   MRI machines: up to three Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   The MagLab's electromagnet: 45 Tesla, nearly a million times Earth's magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>

## Effects on Materials

Strong magnetic fields exhibit diverse interactions with different types of materials.

### Ferromagnetic Materials

Materials like iron, nickel, and cobalt are naturally ferromagnetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Attraction:** They are strongly attracted to magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This can be demonstrated by inserting steel washers into a Nerf football, making it attracted to the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Ferrofluid:** This fluid contains nanoscale pieces of magnetite (an iron-containing mineral) suspended in solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. In an external magnetic field, these particles align, causing the fluid to form ridges and spikes, and even climb the sides of a vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Magnetite was the mineral that led to the discovery of magnetism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Origin of Magnetism:** Electrons are tiny magnets, but in most atoms, their fields cancel out due to pairing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Elements with half-full outer shells of electrons can have magnetic fields at the atomic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. For a material to be magnetic, these atomic magnetic fields and larger regions called "domains" must all be aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This alignment can be induced by applying a strong external magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Conductive, Non-Magnetic Materials

When conductive materials like copper or aluminum move through a magnetic field, their behavior changes significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Lenz's Law and Eddy Currents:** As a metal plate falls through a magnetic field, the changing magnetic flux induces electric currents, known as eddy currents, within the plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. These eddy currents create their own magnetic field that opposes the change in flux, a principle known as Lenz's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This results in the plate falling much slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Energy Dissipation:** The induced eddy currents dissipate energy as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. For example, a metal plate warms up as it falls through the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, and an electromagnetic levitator can generate so much heat that water boils on the levitated plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **"No You Don't" Law:** Lenz's Law can be thought of as the "No You Don't" Law because nature acts to oppose whatever change is attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   If a plate falls, eddy currents slow its descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
    *   If one tries to pick up the plate, a south magnetic pole is induced, attracting it back to the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
    *   Pushing the plate down quickly increases the rate of change of flux, leading to stronger induced currents and a greater opposing magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Applications:** This effect can be seen with various conductive objects like an aluminum cylinder that refuses to roll across the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a> or an aluminum foil-wrapped volleyball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. A potato cannon firing projectiles across the 45 Tesla magnet's fringe field demonstrates significant deceleration, with the projectile rotating to align along the magnetic field lines, minimizing flux change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Projectiles with coils and LEDs light up, showing the induced currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### Superconductors

Superconductors, below their critical temperature, have zero electrical resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Field Expulsion:** When a magnet is brought close to a superconductor, currents are induced to oppose the change in flux. Because there's no resistance, these currents can persist indefinitely and expel all of the magnetic field (Meissner effect) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
*   **Magnetic "Locking":** Some superconductors have engineered defects (a second phase) that trap magnetic field lines, preventing them from moving. This allows for a "locking" effect where a magnet can be held in a fixed position, unable to rise or fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   **Human Levitator:** A 90-pound magnet hovering above a ring of superconductors demonstrates this principle. When a person stands on the magnet, the increased magnetic flux is opposed by persistent currents in the superconductors, creating a repelling magnetic field that allows for levitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

### [[Magnetism in nonferromagnetic materials | Magnetic Properties of All Materials]] (Paramagnetism and Diamagnetism)

All materials possess magnetic properties, though they are often only visible in strong magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   **Paramagnetism:** Some materials are always attracted to magnetic fields. They display paramagnetism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. An example is liquid oxygen, which drips off the bottom of a magnet as it's attracted to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The presence of the external field strengthens the material's magnetic field, causing attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Diamagnetism:** Most materials are repelled by a strong enough magnetic field, regardless of the pole. This is known as diamagnetism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Water is a prime example; its molecules become opposing magnets in an external field, causing repulsion and creating an indent on the water's surface when a magnet is brought near <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Levitation of Non-Magnetic Objects:** This repulsion can be used to levitate objects typically not thought of as magnetic in a strong enough field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
    *   Strawberries, raspberries, and even plastic pizza can be levitated due to their water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
    *   Living organisms, which contain significant water, can also be levitated. Frogs, grasshoppers, and even mice have been levitated in experiments to study the effects of weightlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

## Creating Strong Magnetic Fields

The [[worlds_strongest_magnet | world's strongest magnet]] is a hybrid design, combining two types of electromagnets:
*   **[[superconducting_and_resistive_magnets | Superconducting Magnet (Outsert)]]:** This outer magnet produces 11.5 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Superconducting wires have a limit to the magnetic field they can withstand (around 20 Tesla) before losing their superconductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   **[[superconducting_and_resistive_magnets | Resistive Magnet (Insert)]]:** This inner electromagnet, made of ordinary wire, produces 33.5 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. The combined fields add up to 45 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
    *   Traditional wire-wound electromagnets are limited to about two Tesla due to heat build-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
    *   The resistive magnet uses "Bitter disks," which are very thin plates of conductive material stacked with alternating insulators to form a helix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This design allows cooling water to be pushed axially through the stack, effectively removing heat even from the innermost windings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. This enables much higher currents (up to 57,000 amps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
    *   The stacked plates are aligned with tie rods, compressed with about 20 tons of force, and require thousands of gallons per minute of deionized water to prevent melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.
    *   Material failures can occur when the metal deforms past its plastic limit, potentially shorting to adjacent coils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

## Power Consumption and Safety

Running the [[worlds_strongest_magnet | world's strongest magnet]] requires immense power:
*   **Electricity Usage:** The MagLab can consume about 8% of Tallahassee's total generating capacity when all four power supplies are at full blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
*   **Cost:** The electricity budget for the MagLab is estimated at $250,000 to $300,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. The lab operates within the city's federally mandated reserve, turning down power quickly when the city needs it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

### Safety Considerations

*   **Fringe Field Danger:** The magnetic field extends significantly beyond the magnet itself, known as the fringe field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Even at 100 Gauss (much weaker than 45 Tesla), ferromagnetic objects will start orienting themselves to the field and can be violently pulled in if they get too close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Precautions:** No ferromagnetic objects or metallic implants (like pacemakers) are allowed within the 100 Gauss line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Camera equipment can experience havoc, causing bad video or audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Biological Effects:** While there are no known lasting or long-term effects of strong magnetic fields on living things, temporary effects have been observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. For example, the polarization of stones in the inner ear of rodents can cause them to spin in circles for a few minutes after exiting the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

## Purpose and Applications of Strong Magnetic Fields

The primary reasons for creating such strong magnetic fields include:
*   **[[material_discovery | Material Discovery]]**: Strong magnetic fields are an "extreme environment" that drives the discovery of new materials or helps understand existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
*   **Improving Material Properties**: High fields allow researchers to study and improve the cleanliness of materials by reducing impurities, which minimizes electron scattering and enhances material properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. This enables the observation of phenomena previously unseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
*   **Technological Advancements**: Magnets are core to future technologies, such as electric vehicles, which rely on magnets in their electric motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The use of Google Trends shows increasing public interest in electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

Developing robust locomotion systems is a significant challenge for [[space_exploration]] missions on other planets. Conventional wheel designs face numerous difficulties due to the extreme extraterrestrial environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

## Limitations of Traditional Wheel Designs

### Pneumatic Rubber Tires
Rubber pneumatic tires are unsuitable for the Moon and Mars for several reasons:
*   **Atmospheric Pressure:** There is no or very low atmospheric pressure on these celestial bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Without confining pressure, a rubber tire can "explode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Extreme Temperatures:** Temperatures can drop to extreme lows, causing rubber to become brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. For example, on the Moon, temperatures can range from 250°F above zero in the sun to 250°F below zero in the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Rubber polymers transition from flexible to rigid at around 90°C, demonstrated by rubber exploding when dipped in liquid nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

### Hard Metal Wheels
Early rovers, such as the Curiosity rover, used wheels made of hard metal, specifically aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. While durable, these wheels presented their own set of [[challenges_of_microgravity_in_space_travel|challenges]]:
*   **Weight:** Launching mass into space is expensive, requiring wheels to be as lightweight as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. To meet mass limitations, Curiosity's wheel skin was made extremely thin (0.7 millimeters, thinner than a credit card) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
*   **Durability and Damage:** The aggressive Martian terrain caused much higher peak loads on the thin skin, leading to significant holes and cracks in the wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Although the rover continued its mission, the damage affected its efficiency and mobility, ultimately jeopardizing performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
*   **Plastic Deformation:** Ordinary metals can only withstand a strain of about 0.3% to 0.8% elastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. Beyond this limit, they undergo plastic deformation, meaning they do not return to their original shape, and can even fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. Space vehicle components are designed to avoid exceeding this limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

### Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle (LVR) Wheels
The Apollo LVR used woven steel mesh wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. These "pantograph" structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a> included tread strips to prevent sinking into the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. To minimize plastic deformation of the steel mesh, an internal "bump stop" structure was included. This bump stop halted deformation to keep it below the proportional limit where plasticity would occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. While effective for short missions (e.g., the LVR's farthest journey was 36 kilometers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>, this design is insufficient for longer journeys as plastic deformation would accumulate over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. Steel spring tires on Earth also show significant permanent deformation over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

## Nitinol: A Solution for Space Wheels
To overcome these limitations, a material is needed that is strong and durable like steel but can endure much more strain without permanently deforming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. NASA's research into this led to the development of tires made from Nitinol, a shape memory alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Properties of Nitinol
Nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium discovered in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>, possesses unique properties ideal for space wheels:
*   **Shape Memory Effect:** Nitinol can undergo a solid-state phase change. When heated, atoms arrange in a cubic lattice (austenite phase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. Upon cooling, they form a messier, lower-symmetry arrangement (twinned martensite) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. In the martensite phase, it can be extensively deformed by changing its crystal structure to detwinned martensite without breaking atomic bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. When heated again, it returns to the austenite phase, regaining its original shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. This "parent known memory shape" allows for significant deformation and recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.
*   **Superelasticity (Pseudoelasticity):** Nitinol can stretch up to 8% of its length and still return to its original size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. This is because applying stress can induce a phase change from austenite to detwinned martensite, even without temperature change, allowing significant deformation that reverses when stress is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>.
*   **Elastocalorics:** The phase transformation in Nitinol can release heat when bent (exothermic) and absorb heat when returning to shape (endothermic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>. This property is being investigated for applications like heat pumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>.
*   **Damping:** The material's dissipation potential can act like a shock absorber, allowing the tire to perform some of the dissipation on its own and potentially become a complete suspension system, simplifying vehicle design for space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>.
*   **Load Carrying Capacity:** By distributing the load 360 degrees around the tire, Nitinol tires significantly increase load-carrying capacity without adding mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>.

### Design and Testing of Nitinol Wheels
Nitinol tires are made by weaving Nitinol springs into a mesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>. This is a tedious process, with one engineer needing to perform the weaving 684 times per tire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.

NASA tests these wheels extensively on a rotating carousel with different terrain types, including sand and rocks, to simulate Martian and Lunar surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:16:00">[20:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>. The tests show the Nitinol wheels can support the weight of a vehicle and crew while deforming up to 8% without permanent damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>. This flexibility and strength are crucial for long space missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>.

## Terrestrial Applications
The technology developed for space wheels also has significant terrestrial applications:
*   **Aircraft Tires:** Aircraft tires require very high pressurization (300-400 psi), which poses risks of explosion and demands constant air pressure checks for fuel efficiency and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>. Nitinol-based structural systems eliminate reliance on air, addressing these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:00">[22:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:00]</a>.
*   **Vehicle Tires (e.g., Jeep):** These airless tires cannot get flat and improve fuel economy by eliminating under-inflation issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:07:00">[23:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>.
*   **Other Applications:** Nitinol is also used in medical devices, toys, and bulletproof bike tires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. Its shape memory and force generation properties make it suitable for medical stents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>, actuators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>, and even self-stowing vortex generators on aircraft wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

Nitinol tires are designed to last the entire lifetime of a rover mission, even on the rough terrain of Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>.

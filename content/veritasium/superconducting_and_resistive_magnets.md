The world's strongest continuous magnetic field is generated by a hybrid magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This facility has held the Guinness World Record for the [[worlds_strongest_magnet | strongest continuous magnetic field]] since the year 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The magnet produces a field of 45 Tesla, which is nearly a million times stronger than Earth's magnetic field (0.00005 Tesla) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For comparison, a fridge magnet is about 0.01 Tesla, and MRI machines can reach up to 3 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

The 45 Tesla magnet is two stories tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Its maximum field, or field center, is located within a narrow cylinder running through its middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This intense field area is only about a centimeter tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> and is used for studying very small samples, such as computer chips or cell phone components, in material science and kinetic matter research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Hybrid Design

To achieve such a powerful magnetic field, the magnet is constructed as a hybrid system, combining an outer superconducting magnet with an inner resistive magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Superconducting Outsert
The outer part, known as the superconducting outsert, generates 11.5 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Superconductors are materials that exhibit zero electrical resistance below a certain critical temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. When a magnet is brought near a superconductor below its critical temperature, currents are induced to oppose the change in magnetic flux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. These currents can persist indefinitely, effectively expelling all magnetic fields from the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

However, superconductors have a limit to the magnetic field they can withstand before losing their superconducting properties, typically around 20 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. This limitation necessitates the combination with a resistive magnet for higher fields.

In some high-temperature superconductors, engineered defects or a "second phase" can trap magnetic field lines, preventing them from moving and effectively locking the material in a magnetic configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. This principle is used in applications like the human levitator, where a 90-pound magnet hovers above a ring of superconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### Resistive Magnet
The inner part is a resistive magnet made of ordinary wire, contributing 33.5 Tesla to the total field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Traditional wire-wound electromagnets, like those found in junkyards, can only achieve magnetic fields up to about two Tesla due to heat buildup in the innermost windings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

In the 1950s, Francis Bitter realized that by smashing round wire into very thin plates and stacking them with alternating insulators to form a helix, cooling water could be pushed axially through the stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. This innovation allowed for the removal of heat from the innermost parts, enabling much higher currents—up to 57,000 amps—and thus much stronger fields, reaching 33.5 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

These plates are stacked, aligned with tie rods, and subjected to about 20 tons of force to hold the coil together and ensure electrical connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Thousands of gallons per minute of deionized water are continuously pushed through these coils to keep them cool, as they would otherwise melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

Material failure can occur when the metal goes beyond its plastic limit, deforming and potentially shorting to adjacent coils, leading to significant damage and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

## Energy Consumption

Running the world's strongest magnets requires a substantial amount of energy. The Mag Lab consumes a significant fraction of Tallahassee's electricity, about 8% of the city's total generating capacity when all four power supplies are at full blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. The electricity budget for the facility is around $250,000 to $300,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.

The lab operates within the city's federally mandated reserve, meaning they can ramp down their power consumption much faster than the utility can spin up a generator when the city needs the power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. This arrangement allows the city to monetize power that it would otherwise have to produce but couldn't sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

## Research Applications

Strong magnetic fields are crucial for driving material discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Researchers utilize these extreme environments—high magnetic fields, high electric fields, high pressure, and ultra-low temperatures—to study and improve existing materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. By reducing impurities in materials, the scattering of electrons is minimized, which enhances their properties and allows scientists to observe phenomena previously unobservable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. The potential for discovery with such powerful magnets is still largely unexplored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

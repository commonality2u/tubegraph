The story of [[Penrose tilings and nonrepeating patterns]] involves a pattern thought impossible and a material not supposed to exist, beginning over 400 years ago in Prague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Johannes Kepler's Influence

Johannes Kepler, a famous scientist who lived and worked around Prague, made several contributions that predate and connect to the concept of [[Penrose tilings and nonrepeating patterns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Planetary Orbits and the [[Platonic solids and their significance in mathematics | Platonic Solids]]
Kepler is most famous for discovering that planetary orbits are ellipses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Before this realization, he devised a model of the solar system where planets were on nested spheres, separated by the five [[Platonic solids and their significance in mathematics | Platonic solids]]: the cube, tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron (12 pentagonal sides), and icosahedron (20 sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. There are only five such solids, which was convenient as only six planets were known, allowing a unique solid between each planetary sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. He ordered them to match astronomical observations, driven by a belief in geometric regularity in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Sphere Packing and Kepler's Conjecture
Kepler's interest in geometry extended to practical questions, such as efficiently stacking cannonballs on a ship's deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. By 1611, he proposed hexagonal close packing and the face-centered cubic arrangement as optimally efficient, with cannonballs occupying about 74% of the volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This became known as [[Visualization techniques for understanding the conjecture | Kepler's Conjecture]], which, though he stated it as fact, was only formally proven in 2017, nearly 400 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### The Six-Cornered Snowflake
Kepler published his conjecture in a pamphlet titled "Deniva Sexangula" (On the Six-Cornered Snowflake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. He wondered why snowflakes invariably displayed a six-cornered shape, questioning why they didn't fall with five or seven corners instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. In an era without atomic theory, Kepler speculated about the smallest natural unit of water and how these units could stack mechanically to form hexagonal crystals, similar to his close-packed cannonballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Tilings and Symmetry
Kepler recognized that regular hexagons can tile a flat surface perfectly without gaps, a concept known as periodic tiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. A tiling is periodic if a portion can be duplicated and the pattern continued through only translation, without rotations or reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Common shapes that tile periodically include:
*   Hexagons (six-fold symmetry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>
*   Squares (four-fold symmetry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>
*   Equilateral triangles (three-fold symmetry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
*   Rhombuses (two-fold symmetry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>

Only 2, 3, 4, and 6-fold symmetries are possible for periodic tilings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Regular pentagons, for instance, cannot tile the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Despite this, Kepler experimented with a pattern in his book "Harmonics Mundi" (Harmony of the World) that exhibited a "certain five-fold symmetry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, although it was not clear how it would tile the whole plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Some shapes, like isosceles triangles or a "sphinx tile," can tile the plane both periodically and non-periodically depending on their arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This led to the question: are there tiles that can *only* tile the plane non-periodically? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>

## The Discovery of Aperiodic Tilings

In 1961, Hao Wang studied multi-colored square tiles with rules that required touching edges to be the same color, prohibiting rotation or reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Wang conjectured that if a set of these tiles could tile the plane, they could do so periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

However, Wang's conjecture was proven false by his student, Robert Berger, who found a set of 20,426 tiles that could tile the plane *only* non-periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Such a set of tiles, which can only tile the plane non-periodically, is called an aperiodic tiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

Mathematicians sought aperiodic tilings that required fewer tiles:
*   Robert Berger found a set of 104 tiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   Donald Knuth reduced the number to 92 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   In 1969, Raphael Robinson came up with six tiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Roger Penrose's Contribution

Roger Penrose ultimately reduced the number of tiles needed for an aperiodic tiling to just two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. His process began by trying to tile with pentagons, which left gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. He then iteratively subdivided the pentagons, revealing other shapes like rhombuses and stars, eventually leading to a system where only a finite set of shapes (rhombuses, stars, "justice caps") could fill the plane, but aperiodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This process generates an aperiodic tiling with an "almost five-fold symmetry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Intriguingly, if Kepler's pentagon pattern is overlaid on top of Penrose's, the two match up perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

Penrose simplified his tiles to two main shapes: a thick rhombus and a thin rhombus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Rules for how they connect (enforced by bumps, notches, or matching colors) ensure they can only tile the plane non-periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Another set of Penrose tiles consists of two shapes called "kites and darts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. They have specific angles and are meant to match up based on continuous curves drawn on their surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. These two tiles create an ever-changing pattern that extends to infinity without repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### Characteristics of Penrose Tilings

*   **Uncountably Infinite Patterns**: There are an uncountably infinite number of different patterns of kites and darts that can tile the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Local Indistinguishability**: Despite the infinite variations, if one were on any of these tilings, it would be impossible to tell which one it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Any finite region of one tiling appears infinitely many times in all other versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. This creates a paradox where uncountable infinities of different versions exist, yet are indistinguishable locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### The Golden Ratio and Fibonacci Sequence

The ratio of kites to darts in a Penrose tiling approaches the golden ratio (approximately 1.618) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This is because the pattern exhibits a kind of five-fold symmetry, and the golden ratio (phi) is the most "five-ish" of constants, being heavily associated with pentagons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. The kite and dart pieces themselves are sections of pentagons, incorporating the golden ratio into their construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. The fact that this ratio is an irrational number provides evidence that the pattern cannot be periodic, as a periodic pattern would result in a rational ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

If specific straight lines are drawn on the tiles, they connect up perfectly into five sets of parallel lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. While this demonstrates the five-fold symmetry, the spacing within any set of parallel lines is not perfectly regular, alternating between two different lengths ("long" and "short") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. The counts of these long and short segments in any section relate to the [[Mathematical principles in origami | Fibonacci sequence]] (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...), where the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches the golden ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

## Quasi-Crystals: The Physical Analog

A key question was whether a physical analog for [[Penrose tilings and nonrepeating patterns]] could exist in nature, perhaps in crystal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Penrose initially thought this unlikely, as crystals are defined by repeating units, and the 14 basic unit cells that compose all crystals were well-established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

Crystals are formed by local atomic and molecular arrangements, whereas [[Penrose tilings and nonrepeating patterns]] seemed to require long-range coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. For example, local tile placements in a Penrose tiling might seem correct but prevent correct tiling further out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

In the early 1980s, Paul Steinhardt and his students modeled how atoms form condensed matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. They found that locally, atoms prefer to form icosahedrons, a "forbidden shape" due to its five-fold symmetries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Inspired by Penrose tilings, they designed a new 3D analog structure, now known as a quasi-crystal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Simulations of X-ray diffraction from such a structure showed a pattern with rings of 10 points, reflecting the five-fold symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

Coincidentally, just a few hundred kilometers away, Dan Shechtman created a flaky material from aluminum and manganese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. When he scattered electrons off his material, the resulting diffraction pattern almost perfectly matched Steinhardt's prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

### The Rules of Quasi-Crystals
Paul Steinhardt explained that while local matching rules on tile edges are not strong enough to prevent mistakes in Penrose tilings, rules applied to the vertices (how vertices connect) are strong enough locally to ensure the pattern can extend to infinity without error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

One of the seminal papers on quasi-crystals was aptly titled "Deniva Quinquangula" (On the Pentagonal Snowflake), a shout-out to Kepler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.

### Acceptance and Applications
Not everyone initially accepted the existence of quasi-crystals, as they seemed to defy established laws of nature. Linus Pauling, a double Nobel laureate, famously stated, "There are no quasi crystals, only quasi scientists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. However, Shechtman was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2011 for his discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

Quasi-crystals have since been grown with beautiful dodecahedral shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a> and are being explored for applications such as:
*   Non-stick electrical insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>
*   Cookware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>
*   Ultra-durable steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>

The existence of these patterns and materials highlights what might exist that is currently considered impossible, simply because it falls outside obvious and certain geometric symmetries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. Penrose's work revealed patterns that are both beautiful and counter-intuitive, and materials that existed all along but were not perceived for what they truly are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

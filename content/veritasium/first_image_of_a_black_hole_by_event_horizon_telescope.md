The [[firstever_black_hole_image_by_event_horizon_telescope | first-ever image of a black hole]] was released by the [[firstever_black_hole_image_by_event_horizon_telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]] collaboration on April 10, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## M87 Black Hole Image Details
The image captures [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | plasma]] orbiting the [[supermassive_black_hole_in_m87_and_its_properties | supermassive black hole]] at the center of the [[supermassive_black_hole_in_m87_and_its_properties | M87 galaxy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The bright region indicates where [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | plasma]] is moving towards Earth, appearing brighter due to its near-light speed travel, while dimmer areas show plasma moving away. This phenomenon is known as [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_the_black_hole | relativistic beaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

From the image, scientists determined that the [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | plasma]] orbits clockwise, completing one orbit in approximately 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The observation was made using radio waves, specifically electromagnetic waves with a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This part of the spectrum was chosen because it allows for the visualization of features close to the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | event horizon]] and can penetrate the [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] and interstellar dust to reach telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### M87 Black Hole Characteristics
The [[supermassive_black_hole_in_m87_and_its_properties | supermassive black hole in M87]] is highly active, continuously consuming matter from its glowing hot [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. It also emits narrow, collimated jets, shown in blue, believed to be formed by exceptionally strong magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. These jets extend at least 5,000 light-years, with one appearing to point almost directly towards Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_the_black_hole | Relativistic beaming]] explains why only the jet coming towards us is visible in Hubble Space Telescope images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Relativistic Effects and Imaging
The warping of space-time around the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] enables light from parts of the [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] situated behind the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] to be visible, appearing lensed above and below the shadow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This highlights the [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | relativistic effects]] at play when imaging [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## The Image's "Fuzziness"
The image appears "fuzzy" because the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] is incredibly tiny from our perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. While the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] itself is supermassive, with a mass 6.5 billion times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> and a shadow nearly the size of our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, its immense distance of fifty-three and a half million light-years means its angular size in the sky is only about 40 micro arcseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This represents the absolute limit of current [[technical_challenges_and_global_collaboration_in_observing_black_holes | technological capabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Global Collaboration and Observation
To achieve the necessary resolution, which due to the diffraction limit (a basic law of physics) would typically require a telescope the size of Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, scientists utilized [[technical_challenges_and_global_collaboration_in_observing_black_holes | eight telescopes spread across the globe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. These telescopes simultaneously observed [[supermassive_black_hole_in_m87_and_its_properties | M87]], and the Earth's rotation helped to simulate an Earth-sized telescope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Other Black Hole Observations
Besides [[supermassive_black_hole_in_m87_and_its_properties | M87]], the [[firstever_black_hole_image_by_event_horizon_telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]] also observed Sagittarius A*, the [[supermassive_black_hole_in_m87_and_its_properties | supermassive black hole]] at the center of our Milky Way galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. While an image for Sagittarius A* has not yet been released, simulations suggest its appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Sagittarius A* is much closer at around 26,000 light-years, but also much smaller, with a mass only four million times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. It is less active, only periodically accreting matter, and exhibits greater variation over time, with matter orbiting every four to thirty minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This variability is likely why its image will take longer to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Confirmation of Black Holes and General Relativity
The striking image of the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole in M87]] definitively confirms the existence of [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Furthermore, it spectacularly supports the [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | General Theory of Relativity]], published over a hundred years ago, particularly in the strongest gravitational fields and at the limits of our ability to test the theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The achievement was made possible by the "ridiculous, extreme" efforts of 200 scientists who pursued a seemingly impossible goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

The [[firstever_image_of_a_black_hole|first-ever image of a black hole]] was released by the [[event_horizon_telescope_and_its_results|Event Horizon Telescope]] collaboration on April 10, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The M87 Black Hole Image

This image depicts plasma orbiting the supermassive [[black_holes_and_event_horizons|black hole]] at the center of the galaxy M87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The bright region indicates plasma moving towards Earth, appearing brighter due to relativistic beaming as it travels near the speed of light, and dimmer when moving away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Scientists have determined the plasma orbits clockwise, completing one orbit in approximately two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Observation Wavelength

The image was captured using [[use_of_electromagnetic_waves_to_view_black_holes|electromagnetic waves]] with a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters (radio waves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This specific part of the spectrum was chosen because it allows for the observation of features close to the [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius|event horizon]] and can penetrate the [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole|accretion disk]] and interstellar dust to reach telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### M87 Black Hole Characteristics and Jets

The supermassive [[m87_black_hole_characteristics_and_accretion_disk|black hole in M87]] is highly active, continuously consuming matter from its glowing hot [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole|accretion disk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It also possesses narrow, collimated jets, shown in blue, extending above and below it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These jets are believed to be formed by incredibly strong magnetic fields and stretch at least 5,000 light-years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. One of these jets appears to point almost directly towards Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Relativistic beaming is again why the jet coming towards us is visible in a Hubble Space Telescope image, unlike the one moving away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Warping of Space-Time and Light Behavior

Due to the warping of space-time around the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons|black hole]], light from parts of the [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole|accretion disk]] positioned behind the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons|black hole]] can still be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This light is [[how_light_behaves_around_black_holes|lensed]] above and below the shadow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Why the Image is Fuzzy

The image appears fuzzy because the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons|black hole]] is incredibly tiny from our perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. While the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons|black hole]] itself is supermassive, with a measured mass 6.5 billion times that of our Sun and a shadow nearly the size of our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, its immense distance of 53.5 million light-years means its apparent size on the sky is only about 40 micro arcseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

> [!tip] Understanding Micro Arcseconds
> To grasp the scale of 40 micro arcseconds:
> *   Divide the whole sky into 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
> *   Divide a degree into 60 arcminutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
> *   Divide an arcminute into 60 arcseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
> *   Then, divide an arcsecond by 100, then by 100 again, and then by 100 once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This final division demonstrates the minuscule size of 40 micro arcseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Technological Feat of the Event Horizon Telescope

Capturing such a tiny object pushes the limits of current technological capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Due to the diffraction limit, a fundamental law of physics, an Earth-sized telescope was required to achieve this resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Since building such a telescope is impractical, scientists utilized eight telescopes strategically spread across the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. These telescopes simultaneously observed M87, and the Earth's rotation helped to effectively simulate an Earth-sized telescope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Other Observations: Sagittarius A*

The [[event_horizon_telescope_and_its_results|Event Horizon Telescope]] also observed Sagittarius A*, the supermassive [[black_holes_and_event_horizons|black hole]] at the center of our Milky Way galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. An image of this [[black_holes_and_event_horizons|black hole]] has not yet been released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Compared to M87, Sagittarius A* is much closer at around 26,000 light-years away, but also significantly smaller, with a mass of only four million times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. It is also less active, only periodically consuming matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, and its [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole|accretion disk]] would exhibit greater variation over time, with matter orbiting every four to thirty minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This increased variation likely contributes to the delay in releasing its image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Significance of the Discovery

The striking [[firstever_image_of_a_black_hole|image of the black hole]] in M87 conclusively confirms the existence of [[black_holes_and_event_horizons|black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This achievement also provides spectacular support for the general theory of relativity, published over a hundred years ago, particularly in the strongest gravitational fields and at the very limits of our ability to test the theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The accomplishment highlights the dedication of the 200 scientists who pursued a seemingly impossible goal and achieved it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

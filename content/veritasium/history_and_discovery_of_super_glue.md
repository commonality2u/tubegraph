## The Accidental Breakthrough

Super glue, officially known as cyanoacrylate, was first encountered in 1942 by chemist Harry Coover at the Eastman Kodak Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. During World War II, the U.S. was seeking a clear plastic that could be cast for gun sights, as an alternative to grinding glass lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Coover was working on cyanoacrylate, which seemed promising, but it had an "unfortunate tendency to stick to everything it touched" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Coover described it as a "severe pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. As the war ended, Kodak abandoned the plastic replacement project and continued manufacturing glass gun sights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

The adhesive's true potential was realized almost a decade later in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Coover was again attempting to develop a clear plastic, this time for jet plane canopies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He believed cyanoacrylate could work if the stickiness problem was solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

During this period, Coover instructed his coworker, Fred Joyner, not to take a refractive index of the material, warning that it would "wreck the refractometer" by sticking it together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. However, after testing 909 other compounds, Joyner forgot the warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. He prepared the 910th test by smearing cyanoacrylate between two prisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. After taking the measurement, Joyner found he couldn't pull the prisms apart, panicking that the refractometer, worth nearly $10,000 (adjusted for inflation), was ruined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Instead of getting angry, Coover had a "flash of insight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. He took a sample of cyanoacrylate and started gluing together anything within reach: glass plates, rubber stoppers, metal spatulas, wood, and paper, in various combinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. He observed, "Everything stuck to everything almost instantly and with bonds I could not break apart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

This accidental discovery led him to name the compound Eastman 910 Adhesive, as it was the 910th substance tested in the company's search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Today, it is commonly known as super glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Coover later stated that the discovery was "purely by accident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Early Demonstrations and Applications

To demonstrate its strength, Coover appeared on a game show, showcasing that a single drop of super glue could lift him and the host into the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. He claimed that after 24 hours, one drop of glue could support approximately 15,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

The first industrial sale of super glue occurred in 1956 to Mason and Hanger, who utilized it to assemble atomic bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. The rapid setting time, between 10 and 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, was significantly faster than other adhesives available in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Expanding the Use Case: Medical Applications

The potential of super glue in medicine was realized when Coover's eldest son accidentally cut his finger while making a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Coover, with his experimental mindset, applied some super glue from his lab to the cut, which instantly sealed it shut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. He immediately recognized its [[medical_uses_and_developments_of_super_glue | potential in medicine]] and began working on developing a glue that could replace sutures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

However, his team faced three key problems:
1.  **Heat release:** As super glue sets, the bond formation releases heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. On a cotton ball, the temperature can rapidly rise to over 120 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, which could irritate a wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
2.  **Toxicity:** Over time, super glue in the body breaks down into toxic chemicals like formaldehyde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.
3.  **Brittleness:** Super glue is hard and brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, unlike the soft and flexible nature required for living tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

Coover and his team discovered that increasing the number of carbons in the alkyl chain of the molecule could solve all these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. Longer carbon chains slowed the reaction rate, reduced heat release, prolonged breakdown time (allowing wounds to heal before toxins were released), and allowed for longer, more flexible polymers that could absorb stress better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

Coover submitted an application to the FDA for medical superglue in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. The US military adopted a medical super glue spray for use in the Vietnam War, which saved lives by stopping severe bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. Despite its battlefield success, bureaucratic hurdles delayed approval for years, causing Coover to abandon the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. It wasn't until 1998 that his dream of a medical glue was approved, with the product Dermabond (2-octyl cyanoacrylate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.

## Modern Relevance: Recycling Plastics

Today, scientists are revisiting Coover's original research to explore super glue's use as a plastic, potentially addressing the [[potential_of_super_glue_for_plastic_recycling | plastic pollution problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Unlike many other plastics that degrade when mechanically recycled, super glue polymers can break down into pure monomers when heated to 210 degrees Celsius. These monomers can then be distilled and reactivated into fresh polymer, allowing for continuous recycling without quality degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

Coover emphasized the importance of an open-minded and curious approach to unexplained events and unexpected results, stating that this mindset can unlock new secrets and lead to future discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

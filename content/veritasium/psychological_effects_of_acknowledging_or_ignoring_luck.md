Our perception of personal contributions and external factors like luck can significantly influence our behavior, societal views, and even personal well-being. This phenomenon is deeply rooted in cognitive biases, primarily [[cognitive_bias_and_hypothesis_testing | egocentric bias]].

## Egocentric Bias and Underestimating External Factors
[[cognitive_bias_and_hypothesis_testing | Egocentric bias]] describes the tendency for most people to believe they contribute the majority of the work or cause most of the problems in a shared endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This is illustrated by:
*   A 2017 headline during COVID lockdown stating nearly half of men believed they did most homeschooling, while only 3% of women agreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   Researchers finding that authors of multi-author papers, when asked about their personal percentage of work, sum to an average of 140% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   Couples estimating housework or who starts fights often tally over 100% when combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

This bias isn't due to a desire to appear more helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, but rather because individuals vividly experience and remember their own actions, while being less aware of others' contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This leads to an overestimation of personal contributions and an underestimation of external influences, including the [[role_of_luck_in_success_and_achievement | role of luck in success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## The Overlooked [[role_of_luck_in_success_and_achievement | Role of Luck]]
Many successful individuals, such as professional hockey players, often attribute their achievements to [[the_interplay_between_skill_hard_work_and_luck | hard work, determination, coaches, and parental support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. However, they rarely acknowledge fortunate circumstances like their birth month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Hockey Players**: In many years, 40% of top-tier hockey players were born in the first quarter of the year, compared to just 10% in the fourth quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This disparity is because the cutoff date for youth leagues is January 1st, giving those born earlier a developmental advantage (e.g., being bigger and faster) at a crucial age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. These early advantages compound over time, leading to disproportionate representation in professional leagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Country of Birth**: A significant factor in an individual's success is the [[influence_of_societal_structures_and_country_of_birth_on_success | country of residence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Approximately half the variance in global income is explained by a person's country and its income distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. For instance, being born in a country like Burundi, with the world's lowest gross national income per capita, severely limits earning potential regardless of talent or effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Resistance to Acknowledging Luck
Many individuals are offended by the suggestion that [[role_of_luck_in_success_and_achievement | chance plays a significant role in their success]], feeling it diminishes their [[the_interplay_between_skill_hard_work_and_luck | hard work and talent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. However, success often requires both [[the_interplay_between_skill_hard_work_and_luck | skill and luck]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. World record holders in track and field, for example, are highly skilled, but seven out of eight achieved their records with a tailwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

The [[role_of_luck_in_success_and_achievement | importance of luck]] becomes more pronounced when competition is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. In 2017, out of over 18,300 NASA astronaut applicants, only 11 were selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. A simulation where selection was 95% skill/experience and 5% luck showed that selected astronauts had an average luck score of 94.7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. On average, only 1.6 of the 11 selected would have been in the top 11 based on skill alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, meaning most selections would have been different if luck played no role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Psychological Benefits of Downplaying Luck
While perhaps not aligning with reality, downplaying [[role_of_luck_in_success_and_achievement | chance events]] can have certain psychological benefits:
*   **Increased Effort and Success**: Believing one is in full control of their destiny acts as a "useful delusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. If an outcome is perceived as uncertain, individuals are less likely to invest effort, which decreases their chances of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Justification of Status and Inequality**: Overlooking lucky breaks makes it easier for successful individuals to attribute their wealth or power solely to their own intelligence, effort, and perseverance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This in turn makes it easier to accept societal inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
    *   An experiment where one person in a group was randomly designated as leader resulted in that leader receiving an extra cookie when four were provided for three people, despite no special aptitude or responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This suggests that once status is achieved, feeling deserving of it becomes natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Negative Consequences of Ignoring Luck
Ignoring the [[role_of_luck_in_success_and_achievement | role of luck]] can lead to a distorted view of reality and negatively impact societal contributions:
*   **Entitlement and Reduced Generosity**: Research shows that people who attribute positive outcomes to their own personal qualities donate 25% less to charity than those who list external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This suggests that a belief in pure meritocracy can decrease generosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **[[confirmation_bias_and_its_impact | Survivor Bias]]**: Leaders and politicians, often successful individuals, live in a form of [[confirmation_bias_and_its_impact | survivor bias]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Their experience of success after hard work makes the world appear fair to them, rewarding effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. They lack the experience of those who worked hard and failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, leading them to conclude that less successful people are simply less talented or hard-working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Societal Contribution**: This distorted view can make powerful individuals less inclined to "give back" or contribute to the public infrastructure (e.g., roads, schools, clean water) that enabled their success in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Benefits of Acknowledging Luck
Acknowledging fortunate circumstances has several positive psychological and social effects:
*   **Alignment with Reality**: It brings one's perspective more in line with the true nature of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Increased Likeability**: A study showed that an entrepreneur who acknowledged luck's role in their company's success was judged as kinder and more approachable than one who took full personal credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Gratitude and Happiness**: Raising awareness of fortunate events can lead to feelings of gratitude, which can increase happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Paradoxical Advice for Success
To navigate a world where luck plays a significant but often unacknowledged [[role_of_luck_in_success_and_achievement | role]], a paradoxical approach is suggested:
1.  **Believe in complete control**: To motivate effort and perseverance, it's beneficial to believe that success is solely dependent on one's own talent and hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
2.  **Acknowledge luck's role**: Simultaneously, understand that this belief is not entirely true for oneself or others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. If success is achieved, recognize the significant [[role_of_luck_in_success_and_achievement | role luck played]] and strive to increase the luck of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

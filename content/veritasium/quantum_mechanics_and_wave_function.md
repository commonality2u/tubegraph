## Introduction to Quantum States
In classical mechanics, knowing a system's state—such as a particle's position and velocity—allows for the calculation of its future actions using equations like Newton's second law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | Quantum mechanics]] operates differently: if the quantum state of a particle, known as its wave function, is known, the Schrödinger equation can be used to predict its future behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Typically, a particle's wave function spreads out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Measurement Problem
A significant challenge in [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]] is reconciling the smoothly evolving, spread-out wave function with the observation that when measured, a particle is found at a single point in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Early [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | quantum theory founders]] prioritized the measurement as more real, as it matched observable experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Interpretation of the Wave Function: The Born Rule
Erwin Schrödinger developed his wave equation because scientists like Louis de Broglie suspected that matter exhibited [[wave_physics_and_properties | wave-like properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. However, it was Max Born who proposed how to interpret the wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. He suggested that squaring the complex amplitude of the wave function at any point in space yields the probability of finding the particle there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This "Born rule," though initially a footnote in Born's paper, introduced probability into the core understanding of reality, making the universe no longer strictly [[quantum_mechanics_and_deterministic_universe | deterministic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This probabilistic nature made many scientists, including Einstein, uneasy, but the Born rule remains central to [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]] due to its success in predicting experimental outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Wave Function Collapse
The traditional understanding of [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]] involves two sets of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>:
1.  **Evolution**: When not observed, the wave function evolves smoothly according to the Schrödinger equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
2.  **Collapse**: Upon measurement, the wave function suddenly and irreversibly collapses, with the probability of a particular outcome given by the squared amplitude of the wave function associated with that outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Schrödinger's Cat Thought Experiment
Schrödinger himself disliked this two-rule formulation, leading him to devise the famous Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Setup**: A cat is placed in a box with a radioactive atom, a radiation detector, and a vial of poisonous cyanide gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. If the atom decays, the detector triggers the release of the poison, killing the cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. If the atom does not decay, the cat remains alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Entanglement**: The state of the cat and detector are directly tied to the state of the atom, meaning they are entangled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Superposition**: According to [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]], the atom can exist in a superposition of both decayed and not decayed states simultaneously (assuming no measurements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This superposition then extends to the detector and the cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **The Paradox**: The wave function of everything inside the box becomes a superposition of "atom not decayed, poison not released, cat alive" and "atom decayed, poison released, cat dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Thus, the cat is both alive and dead at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Only when the box is opened and a measurement is made does the wave function collapse, and the cat becomes definitively dead or alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Schrödinger's Intent**: While often used to illustrate the strangeness of [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]], Schrödinger's actual goal was to show that the standard formulation was flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Re-examining Key Concepts
To find a "better way" to understand Schrödinger's cat and [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]], it's helpful to examine superposition, entanglement, and measurement.

### Superposition
Superposition is the idea that quantum objects can exist in multiple states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Evidence**: The double-slit experiment demonstrates superposition: individual electrons fired through two slits produce an interference pattern, implying a single electron passes through both slits simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Analogy to Waves**: This is easily understood with [[wave_physics_and_properties | waves]], which are spread out in space and can interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Since electrons are represented by a wave function when not observed, the double-slit experiment confirms the reality of this wave, allowing electrons to pass through both slits at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Thus, superposition is considered a solid concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Entanglement
Entanglement occurs when two or more particles become linked such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Example**: When two electrons scatter off each other, their trajectories are described by spread-out wave functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. If the momentum of one electron is measured, the momentum of the other is instantaneously known (due to conservation of momentum), even if they are light-years apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Before measurement, each electron's momentum was in a superposition of states; measuring one immediately collapses the wave function of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Single Wave Function**: After interaction, entangled electrons are described by a single, shared wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. More rigorously, there is ultimately only one wave function: that of the entire universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Entanglement is the result when particles interact with something else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Measurement as Entanglement
The measurement postulate was added to connect the mathematics of [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]] to observable reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. However, it seems odd to have different rules for system evolution based on whether or not we are observing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Measurement can be understood as the interaction of one quantum system (e.g., electrons, photons) with another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. If the separate measurement rule is discarded, then in the Schrödinger's Cat experiment, when an observer opens the box, there is no wave function collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Instead, the observer (who is also quantum mechanical) simply becomes entangled with the state of everything inside the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## The Many-Worlds Interpretation
This interpretation, formulated by Hugh Everett, resolves the measurement problem by removing the concept of wave function collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Branching**: When a quantum object in a superposition becomes entangled with its environment, it undergoes environmental decoherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This causes the wave function of the universe to "branch," essentially splitting into slightly different copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Schrödinger's Cat in Many-Worlds**:
    1.  The radioactive atom is in a superposition of decayed and not decayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
    2.  The detector becomes entangled with this superposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
    3.  The detector interacts with environmental particles (air molecules, photons), causing it to decohere and branch the wave function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
    4.  At this moment, the observer is split into two identical copies, each entangled with one outcome of the experiment (e.g., one seeing a live cat, one seeing a dead cat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
    5.  Both outcomes "happen," but to separate, non-interacting versions of the observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Implications**:
    *   The branching of the wave function is happening constantly, possibly infinitely often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
    *   The [[manyworlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many-Worlds]] interpretation takes the mathematical implications of [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]] seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
    *   It offers a cleaner and more elegant formalism, where only wave functions evolving under the Schrödinger equation are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
    *   It suggests that the wave function is the complete picture of reality, and our measurements are just tiny fractions of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
    *   The universe becomes [[quantum_mechanics_and_deterministic_universe | deterministic]] again, as every outcome happens 100% of the time, just in different branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

### Common Objections and Clarifications (with Sean Carroll)
Sean Carroll, a physicist and author on [[manyworlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many-Worlds]], addresses common questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>:

*   **Energy Conservation**: Energy is 100% conserved for the total wave function of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The universe is not duplicated but "subdivided" or "sliced" into pieces, with each branch perceiving a certain amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Frequency of Branching**: Branching occurs frequently whenever a quantum system in superposition becomes entangled with its environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. For example, radioactive decays in one's body (around 5,000 times per second) cause branching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. It's unknown if branching happens infinitely often, as this depends on unexplored aspects of quantum gravity and cosmology, but the number of branches is "humongous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **"Everything That Could Possibly Happen, Happens"**: This is a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. [[manyworlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many-Worlds]] means the wave function obeys the Schrödinger equation, which predicts many *potential* outcomes but not *everything* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. For example, an electron will not convert into a proton because the Schrödinger equation assigns zero probability to such an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   **Instantaneous Branching**: Whether branching happens instantly across all space or spreads at the speed of light is a matter of description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Both descriptions yield the exact same predictions for what is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. This is because "branches" are a convenient human way to understand the universe's wave function, not an inherent part of reality itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>, similar to how temperature describes air instead of listing every molecule's position and velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

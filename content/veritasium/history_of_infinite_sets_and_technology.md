The Hilbert Hotel is a thought experiment used to illustrate counter-intuitive properties of [[Infinity in mathematics | infinity]] and sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It posits a hotel with an [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] number of rooms, numbered one, two, three, and so on, forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Even with an [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] number of rooms, there are limits to the number of people that can be accommodated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Accommodating New Guests

When the Hilbert Hotel is full, with an [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] number of people occupying an [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] number of rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>:

*   **A single new guest:** If a new guest arrives, all existing guests are asked to move down one room (e.g., room one moves to room two, room two to room three) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This frees up room one for the new guest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **A finite number of guests (e.g., a bus with 100 people):** All existing guests move down by the number of new guests (e.g., 100 rooms), vacating the initial rooms for the new arrivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Accommodating Countable Infinities

The hotel can accommodate more complex [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] scenarios:

*   **An infinitely long bus with infinitely many people:** To make room for this new group, each existing guest is asked to move to the room with double their current room number (e.g., room one moves to room two, room two to room four) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This makes all the odd-numbered rooms available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Since there are an [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] number of odd numbers, each person from the [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] bus can be assigned a unique odd-numbered room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **An [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] number of [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] buses:** To accommodate this vastly larger group, an [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] spreadsheet is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Rows represent existing guests and each bus, while columns represent their position within the hotel or bus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Each person receives a unique identifier based on their vehicle and position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. By drawing a zigzag line that traverses every unique ID on this [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] by [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] grid exactly once, the grid can be effectively straightened into a single [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This allows each person to be matched with a unique room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## The Limit: Uncountable Infinity

Despite the hotel's remarkable capacity, there is a limit. This limit is demonstrated by an [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] party bus where guests are identified by unique, [[Infinity in mathematics | infinitely]] long names consisting only of the letters A and B (e.g., ABBAAAAA... or ABABABAB...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Every possible [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] sequence of these two letters exists as a name on the bus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

The manager proves that this group cannot be accommodated using a variation of [[Georg Cantor and the development of set theory | Cantor's diagonalization argument]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>:

1.  Assume a complete [[Infinity in mathematics | infinite]] list of names assigned to rooms can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
2.  Construct a new name by taking the first letter of the first name and flipping it (A to B, B to A), then the second letter of the second name and flipping it, and so on, down the diagonal of the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
3.  The newly constructed name will differ from every name on the list by at least one character (the one on the diagonal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
4.  Therefore, this new name represents a person who does not have a room on the list, proving that the list is incomplete, and thus, the group is too large to fit in the hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Countable vs. Uncountable Infinity

The number of rooms in the Hilbert Hotel represents a [[Countable vs uncountable infinity | countably infinite]] set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This means there are as many rooms as there are positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...), and each can be matched uniquely with an integer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

In contrast, the number of people on the "big bus" is [[Countable vs uncountable infinity | uncountably infinite]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. If an attempt is made to match each person with an integer, there will always be people left over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This demonstrates that "Some [[Infinity in mathematics | infinities]] are bigger than others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Connection to Technology

The discovery of different sized [[Infinity in mathematics | infinities]], particularly through methods like [[Georg Cantor and the development of set theory | Cantor's diagonalization argument]], sparked a line of inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This inquiry led directly to the invention of devices like the one used to watch the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

Scientists are exploring the use of cyanoacrylate, commonly known as super glue, as a novel plastic to help solve the global problem of plastic pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. This represents a potential return to the original research goals of super glue's inventor, Harry Coover, who initially sought a clear plastic before discovering its adhesive properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

## Limitations of Traditional Plastic Recycling

Traditional methods for recycling plastics involve shredding, melting, and reforming them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. However, during this process, the polymers degrade, leading to a reduction in quality and the generation of microplastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. This means plastics can only be recycled mechanically and thermally a limited number of times before the material becomes "useless" and eventually ends up in the environment without breaking down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

## Super Glue as a Depolymerizable Plastic

Unlike most plastics, super glue possesses a unique property that makes it highly suitable for recycling: depolymerization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. When heated to 210 degrees Celsius, the super glue polymer breaks back down into its pure monomer molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. These monomers can then be distilled and reactivated to form fresh, high-quality polymer again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. This ability to revert to the starting material and then reform into a plastic makes it a sustainable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges in Plastic Application

When Coover first worked with cyanoacrylate, its extreme stickiness made it unsuitable as a plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. Furthermore, super glue in its natural state is brittle, another disadvantage for a general-purpose plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. Modern advancements have provided solutions to these challenges:

### Handling and Containment
The original problem of cyanoacrylate sticking to everything has been solved using modern plastics like polypropylene, polyethylene, and Teflon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. These materials are chemically inert and hydrophobic, meaning they do not react with or activate super glue, making them perfect for handling and containing the monomers during processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

### Enhancing Flexibility and Durability
To reduce the brittleness of super glue polymers and enable them to absorb stress better, the goal is to form longer, tangled chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. This is achieved by:

1.  **Controlling Initiation**: Using a very weak base, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), as an initiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. This provides enough initiators to start the polymerization reaction but not so many that only short polymer chains are formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
2.  **Employing a Solvent**: A solvent, like acetone, is used to dilute the conditions and increase the mobility of the monomers and forming polymers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. This allows the polymers more time and freedom to connect, resulting in longer, more stable chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. Once the [[the_chemistry_of_super_glue_and_how_it_works | super glue]] sets, the acetone evaporates, leaving the new plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

## High-Quality Recycling Yield

The process of depolymerizing and re-polymerizing super glue monomers yields an impressive average of 93% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. This contrasts sharply with most widely recycled plastics, which cannot return to their original quality and can only be downcycled once or twice before becoming landfill waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. The high efficiency and quality retention of super glue recycling offer a promising path to revolutionizing plastics and achieving greater sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

This development highlights the importance of an open-minded and curious approach to scientific discovery, as noted by Coover, encouraging researchers to pursue unexpected results that may unlock new secrets and lead to future innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

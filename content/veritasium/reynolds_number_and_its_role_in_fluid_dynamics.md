The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity used to predict fluid flow patterns and determine the transition between [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] and [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30">[05:30]</a>.

## Definition and Calculation
The Reynolds number (Re) is calculated as the velocity of the fluid multiplied by a characteristic length (e.g., the diameter of a pipe), divided by the kinematic viscosity of the fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34">[05:34]</a>. Kinematic viscosity can be understood as a measure of the fluid's internal friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42">[05:42]</a>.

## Historical Experimentation
In 1883, Osborne Reynolds experimentally demonstrated the transition from [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar to turbulent flow]] by passing water through a glass pipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31">[04:31]</a>. He introduced a stream of dye into the pipe to visualize the flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38">[04:38]</a>:
*   At low flow rates, the dye remained a steady stream, indicating [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43">[04:43]</a>.
*   As the flow rate increased, the dye began to oscillate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48">[04:48]</a>.
*   Beyond a critical point, the dye diffused throughout the pipe, signifying [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52">[04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58">[04:58]</a>.

Reynolds' observations showed that the transition to [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] depended on flow rate, pipe width, and fluid viscosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18">[05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22">[05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26">[05:26]</a>. [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | Turbulent flow]] occurred more easily in wider pipes but less easily with more viscous fluids like honey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22">[05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26">[05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29">[05:29]</a>.

## Flow Regimes and Real-World Examples
*   **High Reynolds Numbers**: Result in [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46">[05:46]</a>.
*   **Low Reynolds Numbers**: Lead to [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04">[06:04]</a>. This means [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] is limited to low speeds, small sizes, or highly viscous fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08">[06:08]</a>.

Most fluid flow in everyday life is [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14">[06:14]</a>, making [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar flow]] the exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20">[06:20]</a>. Examples of [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent flow]] influenced by Reynolds number include:
*   Smoke rising from a candle flame: Initially [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar]], but as hot gases accelerate, the Reynolds number increases, causing a transition to [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51">[05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59">[05:59]</a>.
*   Air flow in and out of human lungs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22">[06:22]</a>.
*   Blood pumping through the aorta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25">[06:25]</a>.
*   The atmosphere near the Earth's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28">[06:28]</a>.
*   Air flow in and around cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31">[06:31]</a>.

## Impact on Boundary Layers and Drag
The Reynolds number plays a crucial role in the formation and behavior of boundary layers, which significantly affect drag.
*   **Boundary Layer Formation**: When fluid flows over a surface, fluid molecules at the surface are effectively stuck due to friction and adhesion, resulting in zero velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54">[07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58">[07:58]</a>. The velocity increases with distance from the surface until it reaches the free stream velocity, creating a boundary layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10">[08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19">[08:19]</a>.
*   **Skin Friction**: The surface applies a force to the fluid to form this boundary layer, and the fluid applies an equal and opposite force on the surface, known as skin friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27">[08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32">[08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37">[08:37]</a>.
*   **Transition to Turbulence**: If the fluid velocity is fast or the surface is long, the boundary layer grows and eventually transitions to [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42">[08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46">[08:46]</a>.
*   **Turbulent Boundary Layers**: In a [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent boundary layer]], the fluid swirls and mixes, bringing faster-flowing fluid closer to the surface, which increases skin friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51">[08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59">[08:59]</a>. This results in significantly more drag than [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar ones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02">[09:02]</a>.

### Applications in Aerodynamics and Efficiency
Understanding and manipulating the Reynolds number is crucial for [[impact_of_fluid_flow_on_aerodynamics_and_efficiency | aerodynamics]] and efficiency:
*   **Aircraft and Ships**: Boundary layers around planes and large ships are mostly [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]], and skin friction accounts for the majority of the drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07">[09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12">[09:12]</a>. Smooth surfaces can reduce drag and save fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16">[09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24">[09:24]</a>.
*   **Vortex Generators on Aircraft**: Despite the desire for smooth surfaces, airplanes sometimes feature ridges called vortex generators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03">[10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10">[10:10]</a>. These intentionally induce [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] over the wing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16">[10:16]</a>. This [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulence]] mixes faster-flowing air closer to the surface, energizing the flow and allowing it to follow the wing's curve longer, preventing flow separation and stall, thereby maintaining lift at low speeds or high angles of attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02">[11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06">[11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15">[11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22">[11:22]</a>.
*   **Golf Balls**: Early golfers observed that smooth golf balls didn't fly as far as those with dimples or nicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48">[11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54">[11:54]</a>. On a smooth ball, a [[comparison_between_turbulent_and_laminar_flow | laminar boundary layer]] forms, leading to easy flow separation and a large wake of low-pressure [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] air behind the ball, which causes pressure drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03">[12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08">[12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11">[12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15">[12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19">[12:19]</a>. Dimples on a golf ball force the boundary layer to become [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01">[13:01]</a>. A [[characteristics_of_turbulent_flow | turbulent boundary layer]] adheres longer to the ball's surface, reducing the size of the turbulent wake and significantly lowering pressure drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32">[12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40">[12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45">[12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48">[12:48]</a>. This results in a large drop in drag coefficient, sometimes by nearly a factor of two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14">[13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17">[13:17]</a>.

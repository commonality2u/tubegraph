Engineers are increasingly drawing inspiration from origami for various applications, including [[origami_in_medical_and_technological_devices | medical devices]], [[engineering_applications_of_origami | space applications]], and even bulletproofing [00:00:03]. This ancient art of paper folding has proven remarkably useful for modern engineering [00:00:17].

## History and Evolution of Origami
Origami, literally meaning "folding paper," has a history dating back at least 400 years in Japan [00:00:21]. Initially, the number of designs was limited, with only about 100 to 200 patterns in total [00:00:27]. However, the 20th century saw a significant transformation, leading to tens of thousands of documented designs today [00:00:40]. A key figure in this renaissance was Japanese origami master Akira Yoshizawa, who created thousands of new designs and published numerous books, inspiring a worldwide [[history_and_evolution_of_origami_designs | renaissance of origami creativity]] [00:00:45].

For example, designing a complex origami piece like a cactus with spines required years of development to achieve the desired features from a single sheet of paper [00:01:07]. A cactus and pot, made from one uncut square of paper (approximately one meter square), demonstrated a huge size reduction from the initial material [00:01:33].

## Why Origami in Engineering?
Origami is valuable in engineering because it provides a method for transforming a flat sheet into another shape with minimal processing [00:02:29]. An intrinsic benefit of origami is that the simple act of folding a material can make it more rigid [00:04:52].

### Overcoming Material Challenges
While paper is easy to fold, a more common challenge in [[engineering_applications_of_origami | engineering applications]] is folding thick, rigid materials like polypropylene [00:05:11]. This is overcome by using "surrogate folds," cutting or scoring materials, and adding hinges where necessary, allowing thick rigid materials to be effectively folded [00:05:28].

## Space Applications
The ability to fold rigid materials compactly and deploy them reliably is crucial for space technology.

### Miura-ori Pattern
One prominent example is the Miura-ori pattern, considered the "granddaddy" of deployable structures [00:05:55]. This pattern has been used for solar arrays and was one of the first patterns to fly on a space mission in 1995, aboard the Space Flyer Mission [00:05:59]. It allows for opening and closing in a single motion, resulting in a very thin and compact form when flattened [00:06:12].

### Origami Flasher
Another pattern, the "origami flasher," has been proposed for satellite solar arrays [00:06:17]. This design increases compactness for launch and improves reliability during deployment [00:06:29].

## Aerodynamic Improvements
Origami research is also being applied to improve the aerodynamics of freight locomotives [00:06:37]. Freight locomotives typically have poor aerodynamics due to their brick-like shape [00:06:44]. An ideal solution would be a nose cone, but this is impractical as locomotives are hooked up anywhere along a train [00:06:50].

Researchers have developed a scaled prototype of an origami-inspired nose cone that folds up very flat but can then deploy [00:07:04]. Computer models and wind tunnel testing indicate that this design could save a single company multiple millions of dollars annually in diesel costs [00:07:16].

## Functional Motion and Miniaturization
The functional motions inherent in origami are inspiring new device designs. [[compliant_mechanisms_in_space_technology | Compliant mechanisms]] can complete full 360-degree rotations, even if traditional compliant mechanisms typically cannot achieve continuous revolution [00:07:46]. Paper folders, however, have created continuously revolving compliant mechanisms, such as the Kalita cycle [00:08:05].

Origami motions are also being utilized in [[origami_in_medical_and_technological_devices | medical devices]]. For instance, origami bellows were developed for the da Vinci surgical robot to support flexible catheters during insertion into the body, ensuring continuous support [00:03:18]. A variant of an origami-inspired mini-gripper is now used in robotic surgeries, reducing parts by 75%, being smaller, and offering a wider range of motion [00:08:49].

Origami principles are scalable, enabling extreme miniaturization of devices. Researchers have developed techniques for microscopic self-folding origami, including the world's smallest origami flapping bird, which is smaller than a grain of salt [00:09:05]. While a flapping bird itself has no direct application, the underlying principle of microscopic, self-folding machines is relevant for [[origami_in_medical_and_technological_devices | medical devices]] and implants [00:09:53]. An example is a nano injector for gene therapy, which is only four micrometers thick, allowing 400 of them to fit on a one-centimeter computer chip [00:10:10].

## The Mathematics Behind the Folds
The translation of origami ideas into practical engineering solutions relies heavily on mathematical modeling and experimentation [00:16:18]. Mathematics and physics backgrounds are crucial for describing and solving these problems [00:11:15].

A key mathematical tool is the "crease pattern," which is a plan for how to fold a specific design [00:12:07]. For designs that can be represented as stick figures (like a scorpion with its body, tail, legs, and claws), the "circle packing method" is used [00:12:21]. This abstract concept involves representing each feature by a circular region and arranging these circles on a square sheet of paper [00:12:37]. The arrangement of these circles forms the skeleton of the crease pattern, from which all other folds can be geometrically constructed by following systematic rules [00:13:17]. This method revolutionized [[history_and_evolution_of_origami_designs | origami design]] by ensuring the folded pattern yields the exact desired shape [00:14:09].

For more complex, surface-like shapes (e.g., a sphere or a "blobby body" like an elephant), the stick figure algorithm does not work [00:14:46]. About ten years ago, Japanese mathematician Tomohiro Tachi developed "Origamizer," an algorithm that takes a triangulated surface as a mathematical description and generates the folding pattern to create that surface [00:15:07]. This allows a sheet of virtually any material to take on any three-dimensional shape [00:15:28].

## Conclusion
Origami is useful in engineering because it provides a method of taking a flat sheet of material and forming it into virtually any shape by folding [00:15:36]. If the end product is flat, origami offers a way to reduce its dimensions while maintaining easy deployment [00:15:45]. The simple act of folding can also increase material rigidity [00:15:53]. Furthermore, origami principles allow engineers to utilize the flexibility of materials to create specific motions and enable the miniaturization of devices [00:15:58]. By leveraging centuries of folding experimentation and combining it with rigorous mathematical modeling, engineers can develop innovative and efficient solutions for fields ranging from space technology to aerodynamics.

Radiation can be frightening, especially certain types of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A Geiger counter specifically measures ionizing radiation, which possesses enough energy to rip electrons off atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This type of radiation is measured in units called Sieverts (Sv) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Exposure to more than two Sieverts all at once is likely to be fatal shortly thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Everyday Exposure to Ionizing Radiation

While high doses are dangerous, humans are constantly exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Bananas:** These fruits are rich in potassium, and some of this potassium is naturally radioactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Eating a banana exposes you to approximately 0.1 microSieverts of radiation, which is one ten-millionth of a Sievert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Bananas can be used as a scale for radiation doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Human Proximity:** Since people become radioactive too, sleeping next to someone exposes you to more radiation than sleeping alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, this dose is insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Natural Background Radiation

The Earth itself contributes significantly to natural radiation exposure. [[background_radiation_levels_globally | Ionizing radiation]] emanates from the soil, rocks, air, and even from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The average level of radiation in Sydney, for instance, is about 0.15 microSieverts per hour, which is considered about average globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Generally, global levels range between 0.1 and 0.2 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, although some places have significantly higher levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Exploring Radioactive Sites

To understand the range of radiation exposure, several notable locations illustrate different levels:

### [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Hiroshima]], Japan
The world's first nuclear bomb was detonated about 600 meters above the Peace Dome in Hiroshima <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Despite the immense destructive impact, almost 70 years later, the radiation level in Hiroshima is only about 0.3 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Uranium Mine (Marie Curie's Workplace)
This old uranium mine, where uranium was discovered and Marie Curie obtained her raw material, exhibits higher radiation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Mine Reading:** The mine shows about 1.7 microSieverts per hour, which is roughly 10 times the natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Fluorescent Uranium:** A small piece of uranium ore remaining in a wall still fluoresces under UV light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Marie Curie's Lab:** In Marie Curie's former office, parts like the doorknob and the back of her chair remain radioactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The doorknob registers about 10 times the background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, and alpha particles can still be detected coming off her chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This is thought to be due to traces of radium she left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Trinity Bomb Test Site]], New Mexico
This is the site where the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The intense heat from the bomb vaporized the area and fused the desert sand into green glass known as trinitite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, which is found only here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Site Reading:** The radiation level at the Trinity site is about 0.8 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Trinitite Reading:** The trinitite itself is slightly more radioactive, with readings of 2 or 3 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Air Travel
An unexpected location with higher radiation levels is an airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. As altitude increases, there is less atmosphere to shield from [[effects_of_cosmic_rays_on_aviation_and_space_missions | cosmic rays]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Altitude Readings:**
    *   18,000 ft: Up to 0.5 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
    *   23,000 ft: Up to 1 microSievert per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
    *   33,000 ft: Over 2 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
    *   Higher altitudes and towards the poles: Over 3 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>

### [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Chernobyl]], Ukraine
Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four melted down on April 26th, 1986, spreading radioactive isotopes across the surrounding area and into Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Current Reading:** In the area of the reactor, current readings are around 5 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Staying for one hour at this level would result in a dose similar to a dental x-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Decontamination:** The radiation level is not higher partly because a couple of meters of topsoil were removed from the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Fukushima Exclusion Zone]], Japan
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster involved a smaller release of radioactive material compared to Chernobyl (about 10%), but being much fresher (only 3 years since the accident at the time of filming), less of the material had decayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Readings:** Readings in the exclusion zone range from 5 to 10 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Decontamination Efforts:** Similar to Chernobyl, Japanese authorities are collecting meters of topsoil into black bags along the roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Precautions:** A mask is worn to prevent radioactive dust from entering the lungs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Chernobyl Hospital Basement (Firemen's Clothing)
The most radioactive place visited was the basement of the hospital in Pripyat, where the clothing of firemen who fought the Chernobyl reactor fires was dumped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Readings:**
    *   Just outside the door: 500 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>
    *   Inside the room: 1,500 microSieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>
    *   Staying in this room for a couple of hours would result in an annual dose of background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
    *   One hour in the basement would result in 2,000 microSieverts, equivalent to a year's worth of natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Radiation Doses in Context

To put these numbers into perspective:
*   **CT Scan:** A patient receives about 7,000 microSieverts during a CT scan, which is 3 years' worth of natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Fukushima Residents (Lifetime):** People living around Fukushima are estimated to receive an additional 10,000 microSieverts over their lifetime due to the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Occupational and Lifestyle Exposure
[[radiation_exposure_in_daily_life_and_occupations | Radiation exposure in daily life and occupations]] varies significantly:
*   **Radiation Workers:** Limited to a maximum of 50,000 microSieverts per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Astronauts:** An [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | astronaut]] on the Space Station for 6 months receives about 80,000 microSieverts of radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Smokers:** The highest levels of ionizing radiation exposure typically go to smokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. On average, a smoker's lungs receive 160,000 microSieverts of radiation every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This is due to radioactive polonium and lead present in tobacco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, exposing them to both carcinogens and very high levels of [[health_impacts_of_radiation_exposure | radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

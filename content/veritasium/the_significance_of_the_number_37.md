The number 37 appears to hold a unique and often subconscious significance in human perception and mathematics, frequently chosen when people are asked to name a "random" number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## The "Blue-Seven Phenomenon" and Human Randomness
Humans are generally poor at selecting truly random items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This is observed in phenomena like the "blue-seven phenomenon," where people consistently choose blue and the number 7 when asked to pick a random color and number across various cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. When it comes to numbers between 1 and 100, 37 has long been suggested as the equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

In informal polls and observations, 37 frequently emerges as a top choice:
*   Initial interviews asking people for a random number between 1 and 100 showed a surprising number of individuals picking 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. While 7 was the most common overall, likely due to expectations of a 1-10 range, 37 was the most common two-digit number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   The Stanford MIT Jargon File, which documents hacker slang, notes 37 as the random number of choice for computer programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   A Reddit poll of 1,380 people from four years prior found 69 to be the most popular, but 37 was the second most popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

### Large-Scale Random Number Survey
A large-scale survey asking people to pick a random number between 1 and 100 received 200,000 responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. The results showed consistent patterns in number choices, indicating that people's selections are "decidedly not random" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

Ignoring numbers like 1, 100 (due to priming), 42, and 69 (not considered truly random by many) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>:
*   The numbers that stood out as "more random" were 7, 73, 77, and 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   When people were asked to pick the number they thought the fewest others would pick (aiming for truly random selections), 73 and 37 were nearly tied as the most selected numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   The least-picked numbers were often multiples of 10, such as 90, 30, 40, 70, 80, and 60, suggesting they don't feel random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

This phenomenon, where certain numbers are consistently chosen by people attempting to be random, highlights a [[cultural_patterns_in_choosing_random_numbers | cultural pattern in choosing random numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

### Perception of Randomness
People tend to perceive randomness in certain ways:
*   Even numbers are often seen as less random than odd numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
*   Numbers ending in 5, or extremes like 1 or 9, are also perceived as less random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
*   Digits 3 and 7 were the most selected digits in the survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

## Mathematical Significance of 37

There is a mathematical case for 37 being a preferred choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
*   **Prime Numbers**: Primes often feel like the most random numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. They don't appear as frequently in everyday measurements (pixel counts, fruit boxes), and there is no simple formula to find the next prime number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Primes essentially occur at random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
*   **Median Second Prime Factor**: If one were to track the second smallest prime factor of every number from 1 to infinity, the median second prime factor is 37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. This means half of all numbers have a second prime factor of 37 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.
*   **Other Properties**: 37 is described as an irregular prime, a Cuban prime, a lucky prime, a sexy prime, a permutable prime, and a Padovan prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.
*   **Mathematical Tricks**: There are mathematical tricks involving 37, such as a six-digit number divisibility rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

## Practical Application: The 37% Rule

The number 37 plays a role in optimal decision-making strategies for certain types of problems, known as the Secretary Problem or Marriage Problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>. This applies to choices that are immediate and final, where all options cannot be assessed at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.

The [[the_application_of_the_37_rule_in_decision_making | optimal strategy]], also known as the 37% rule, is as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>:
1.  **Explore**: Automatically reject the first 37% of options to gather information and understand the range of choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>.
2.  **Decide**: After the initial 37%, select the very next option that is better than all previous options seen so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>.

Using this method, the chances of selecting the best option are approximately 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>. This rule can be applied to various real-life scenarios, such as renting an apartment, accepting a job offer, or even choosing a life partner over a set period of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. For example, if seeking a marriage partner over 10 years, one would spend the first 3.7 years exploring and then pick the next person better than anyone previously encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.

## Cultural and Personal Significance

The number 37 is deeply embedded in various aspects of culture and personal experience.
*   **Magic Trick**: There's a widespread professional magic trick called "The 37 Force" that relies on an audience member picking 37 "out of thin air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
*   **The 37 Website**: A website dedicated to collecting instances of the number 37 was built in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Its creator receives emails from strangers worldwide who also collect "37s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This community has been tirelessly collecting for over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>.
*   **Cultural References and Coincidences**: Comedian Charles Fleischer's routine from the 1980s highlighted a "litany of coincidences" involving 37, such as 37 holes in a telephone speaker, Shakespeare writing 37 plays, and 37 movements in Beethoven's Nine Symphonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>. Instances of 37 can be found everywhere, from product measurements like Nutri-Grain granola bars (37 grams) to sports jersey numbers and serial numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>. The 37th [[mersenne_primes_and_their_significance | Mersenne prime]] even made news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The number 37 stands out as humanity's go-to "random" number, a prominent prime number, and an ideal figure for decision-making through the 37% rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>. Its consistent appearance in various contexts suggests a subconscious recognition of its significance, making it feel "right" to us as a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>.

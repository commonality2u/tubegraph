The concept of seeking out information that disproves a hypothesis, rather than confirming it, is crucial for arriving at the truth. This principle is fundamental to the [[the_concept_of_falsifiability_in_science | scientific method]] and is illustrated through a thought experiment involving a number sequence.

## The Number Sequence Game

Participants are given an initial three-number sequence, 2, 4, 8, and asked to discover a hidden rule that these numbers obey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. They can propose their own three-number sequences, to which the host will respond "yes" (it follows the rule) or "no" (it does not) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The ultimate goal is to deduce the rule.

Initially, participants often assume the rule is "multiply by 2" (e.g., 16, 32, 64) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. They continue to propose sequences that fit this assumption (e.g., 3, 6, 12; 10, 20, 40; 5, 10, 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. While these sequences consistently receive a "yes," the proposed rule ("multiply by 2") is not the actual rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### The Challenge of Confirmation Bias

This approach highlights a common cognitive pitfall: [[confirmation_bias_and_its_effects | confirmation bias]]. Participants tend to propose numbers that *confirm* their existing hypothesis, rather than trying to *disprove* it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. They are looking for "yes" answers, expecting the answer to be positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

The key to solving the puzzle lies in seeking sequences that are expected to receive a "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. For example, proposing "2, 4, 7" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> (which still follows the rule) or "3, 6, 9" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The critical turning point comes when a sequence like "10, 9, 8" is proposed and explicitly fails the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This negative feedback immediately leads to the correct realization: the rule is simply "numbers in increasing order" or "ascending order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Any numbers, regardless of their difference, fit the rule as long as they are in ascending order (e.g., 1, 2, 3; 7, 8, 9; 1, 7, 13; 11, 12, 13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## The Black Swan Metaphor

This concept is inspired by Nassim Taleb's book, *The Black Swan* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The "black swan" serves as a metaphor for the unexpected and unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Historically, the theory held that all swans were white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Every observation of a white swan seemed to confirm this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. However, the discovery of black swans in Australia disproved this long-held belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

The core lesson is that one can never definitively *prove* a theory true, no matter how much confirming evidence accumulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Instead, theories gain strength when attempts to disprove them fail.

## The Scientific Method

This principle is at the heart of the [[the_concept_of_falsifiability_in_science | scientific method]]. Scientists actively try to [[experimental_verification_and_challenges | disprove]] their [[theories_and_evidence_for_dark_matter | theories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It is when these vigorous attempts to falsify a theory fail that it is considered to be robust and likely reflects an underlying truth about reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Conclusion

To genuinely arrive at the truth and avoid self-deception, it is essential to actively seek out disconfirming evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. In various aspects of life, when something is believed to be true, one should make every effort to disprove it. Only by challenging one's own assumptions can a deeper and more accurate understanding be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

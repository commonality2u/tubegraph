## Introduction
Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, has long been suspected of offering the best chance for [[search_for_alien_life_on_europa | finding alien life]] in our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This suspicion dates back to at least 1982, as highlighted in Arthur C. Clarke's novel "2010, Odyssey Two," where an alien intelligence warns, "All these worlds are yours, except Europa, attempt no landing there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Despite the perilous conditions surrounding Jupiter, NASA launched the Europa Clipper mission in October 2024 to investigate this intriguing moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Jupiter's Extreme Environment
Jupiter poses significant [[space_exploration_challenges | challenges]] for exploration due to its powerful magnetic field and the resulting radiation belts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Magnetic Field and Radiation
Jupiter's immense pressure deep within its core is believed to transform hydrogen into a metallic liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This metallic hydrogen generates a magnetic field nearly 20,000 times stronger than Earth's when measured at the same distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This magnetic field is harmless on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

However, the most volcanically active world in the solar system, Jupiter's moon Io, lies within this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Io's volcanoes constantly eject tons of sulfur dioxide, with one ton becoming ionized and trapped in Jupiter's magnetic field every second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. These particles are accelerated to over 300 kilometers per second, forming massive radiation belts that extend past Europa and Jupiter's other moons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Impact of Radiation on Europa
For electronics, this intense radiation is highly damaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Even with modern shielding, a spacecraft within these belts would only survive for about three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. On Europa's surface, the radiation exposure is about 5,400 milliSieverts per day, which is 1,800 times the annual dose on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Exposure for a few hours would be fatal to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

The [[europa_clipper_mission_and_challenges | Europa Clipper mission]] addresses this by orbiting Jupiter from afar and making 49 rapid flybys of Europa over four years to avoid prolonged exposure, using downtime to transmit data back to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This strategy is an example of [[radiation_hardening_in_space_missions_and_electronics | radiation hardening]] in space missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

>[!INFO] Europa Clipper's Name
>The mission is named "Clipper" after the fast and nimble 19th-century clipper ships that would quickly dip in and out of ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Europa's Icy Surface and Subsurface Ocean
Despite the harsh radiation, Europa holds a significant secret: a hidden ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### Lack of Craters
When Voyager 1 imaged Europa in 1979, a striking feature was the absence of craters compared to most other moons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This suggests that geological activity within the last 60 million years has been erasing impact craters from its surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Evidence of an Ocean
In 1995, the Galileo mission arrived at Jupiter and its moons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Galileo's magnetometer detected an induced magnetic field on Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Because Jupiter's magnetic field wobbles as the planet rotates every 10 hours, this changing field induces a strong magnetic field on Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This implies the presence of an electrically conductive layer within Europa, likely close to the surface, within tens of kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Europa's surface is predominantly covered in a thick crust of water ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Reddish-brown regions on the surface, when analyzed by a spectrometer, show characteristics consistent with hydrated salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Recent experiments at JPL have shown that sea salt, when subjected to intense radiation, turns from white to this brownish color, further supporting the presence of salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

Scientists suspect that a deep saltwater ocean, possibly 100 kilometers deep, lies beneath Europa's icy shell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This ocean could contain twice as much water as all of Earth's oceans combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This internal ocean likely drives the geological activity that resurfaces the moon, explaining the lack of craters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### Tidal Flexing: The Heat Source
Despite Europa's surface temperature being consistently below -160Â°C due to receiving only 4% of Earth's sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, its subsurface ocean is kept liquid by an internal heat source: tidal flexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

Europa's orbit around Jupiter is not perfectly circular. This is due to an orbital resonance with Io and Ganymede, where for every one orbit of Ganymede, Europa completes two, and Io completes four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This resonance causes Io to pull Europa inward on one side of its orbit, while Ganymede pulls it outward on the other, making Europa's orbit eccentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

As Europa orbits, Jupiter's gravitational pull is stronger on the closer side, causing the moon to be constantly stretched and squeezed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The friction generated by this "tidal flexing" of the entire moon is believed to produce enough heat to keep the ocean liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This effect is stronger closer to Jupiter, explaining Io's extreme volcanic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

If Europa had no ocean, its surface would flex by only about one meter in amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. However, with an ocean, the amplitude of flexing increases to 30 meters, an enormous deflection that would be detectable by gravity data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The presence of unique arcuate features called "cycloids" on Europa's surface is further evidence for an ocean, as their formation requires a crack propagating at a specific speed, following the changing stress field induced by an ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Potential for Life
The existence of a subsurface ocean heated by tidal forces makes Europa a prime candidate for [[potential_habitability_of_jupiters_moon_europa | habitability]].

### Hydrothermal Vents
The tidal flexing not only heats the ocean but also pushes magma in the outer core closer to the seafloor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Water flowing through the crust above this magma is heated and picks up minerals, which are then ejected into the ocean, forming hydrothermal vents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. On Earth, these vents support diverse ecosystems thousands of meters below the surface, even without sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Lifeforms here rely on unique bacteria that feed on minerals from the vents, rather than solar energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

Scientists believe Europa's ocean could have existed for up to four billion years, providing ample time for life to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Organisms could utilize chemical reactions involving methane, carbon dioxide, or sulfur as fuel for metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. The search is primarily for single-celled organisms, not complex life forms like fish or whales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### Role of Radiation in Supporting Life
Surprisingly, Jupiter's intense radiation may actually *enhance* Europa's potential for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. High-speed particles hitting Europa's surface can impart enough energy to water and carbon dioxide molecules to form new compounds like formaldehyde or hydrogen peroxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. These compounds could serve as food for life if they can reach the subsurface ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Evidence of "chaos zones" on the surface, where the icy crust appears to have collided and material has been shoved into the shell, suggests mechanisms for these potential nutrients to reach the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## Exploration of Europa
The [[europa_clipper_mission_and_challenges | Europa Clipper]] and the European Space Agency's JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer) missions are designed to study Europa and its potential for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

### Europa Clipper's Approach
The Europa Clipper will not land on Europa's surface or drill through its kilometers-thick ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Instead, it aims to fly through potential water geysers or plumes, similar to how the "SnotBot" drone collects whale snot on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. The Hubble Space Telescope has indicated possible geyser eruptions on Europa, and if confirmed, Clipper could use its mass spectrometer to analyze their chemical composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

Clipper's instruments include:
*   **Infrared spectrometer:** To identify and map salts and organic compounds on the surface based on light bounced off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Ultraviolet spectrograph:** To search for and potentially confirm the presence of plumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Cameras:** A wide-angle camera for mapping almost the entire globe at better than 100 meters per pixel resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>, and a narrow-angle camera for half-meter per pixel images from an altitude of 50 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

While Clipper gathers data, a future mission, such as a lander, would be necessary to physically search for signs of life on Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Studies suggest a lander could survive on Europa's surface for about a month, long enough to collect samples from below the radiation-processed depth and analyze them with a mass spectrometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Comparison with Enceladus
While Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has confirmed water plumes and a subsurface ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, Europa remains a primary focus because its ocean is believed to have existed for a much longer time, potentially allowing life to evolve more extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Collaboration with JUICE
The European Space Agency's JUICE mission, which launched earlier, will arrive at Jupiter 15 months after Clipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. JUICE will also perform flybys of Europa before orbiting Ganymede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Informal conversations between the JUICE and Clipper science teams are ongoing to explore how having two spacecraft in the system simultaneously can enhance scientific understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. For example, they can corroborate magnetic signals of bursts from Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

First distant observations from Europa Clipper are expected in 2030, with high-resolution data following in 2031 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. The prospect of exploring this ocean world, once off-limits in fiction, has become a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

Concrete is a man-made substance that has been used for thousands of years due to its strength, durability, and low cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It is essentially [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | liquid rock]] that can be poured into any desired shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Cement, the "glue" or matrix within concrete, is the most important man-made substance on the planet, with more of it used annually than any other substance apart from water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Approximately 500 kilograms of cement are produced each year for every person on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Early Cement Production

The earliest forms of cement relied on limestone, which is primarily calcium carbonate, as the key ingredient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. To create this primitive cement:
1.  Limestone is heated to approximately 1,000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
2.  This process drives off carbon dioxide (CO2) from the rock, leaving behind calcium oxide, also known as quicklime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
3.  Grinding the calcium oxide and mixing it with water initiates an exothermic reaction, producing calcium hydroxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
4.  This mixture could then be poured into a mold, and over time, it would absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, reverting to calcium carbonate as the water evaporated, thereby hardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

However, this primitive cement had limitations: molds could not be too large because CO2 couldn't penetrate sufficiently to harden the entire material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Additionally, it would not harden underwater, as there is no CO2 in water for the reaction to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Roman Concrete

The Romans developed a significant advancement in concrete by adding volcanic ash, known as pozzolana, to crushed limestone before heating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This addition created a much stronger and more durable cement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. [[roman_concrete_versus_modern_concrete | Roman concrete]] was notable for its ability to harden underwater and in thick slabs, making it suitable for monumental structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Examples include the Pantheon, the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome, which has stood for 2,000 years, and concrete piers built into the sea, some of which are still standing today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

The secret to Roman cement's strength and ability to set underwater came from the pozzolana, which contains silica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Silica fundamentally changes the [[chemical_composition_and_reactions_in_concrete | chemistry of the cement]], meaning it does not need to dry to harden. Instead, water becomes an integral part of the hardened concrete, allowing it to achieve maximum strength when setting underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Rediscovery and Modern Cement

The Roman concrete recipe was lost for centuries until its rediscovery in a Swiss monastery in the 1400s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Since then, engineers and scientists have experimented to find optimal cement recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Nearly 2,000 years after the Romans, it was discovered that adding clay or shale to limestone before crushing and heating produced the same effects as pozzolana, thanks to their silica content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Today, virtually all concrete is made with a cement formulation developed in the 1840s, known as **Portland cement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The name "Portland" is a marketing term, chosen because the cement's gray color resembled desirable rocks quarried near Portland, England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

The production of Portland cement involves:
1.  Crushing limestone and mixing it with a percentage of shale or clay to provide silicates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
2.  Grinding this mixture into a fine powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
3.  Heating it in a kiln to very high temperatures, producing hard nodules called "clinker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
4.  Although clinker was previously considered waste due to its hardness to grind, grinding it down produces a cement far superior to other known chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Comparison: Roman Concrete vs. Modern Concrete

While [[roman_concrete_versus_modern_concrete | Roman concrete]] had impressive longevity, the claim of its superiority to modern concrete is generally inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Self-Healing Properties**: Roman concrete contained undissolved calcium oxide (quicklime). When cracks appeared and water infiltrated, the calcium oxide would dissolve, forming calcium hydroxide, which then led to new growth of calcium carbonate, effectively making the concrete self-healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
*   **Survivor Bias**: When evaluating Roman structures, we only observe those that have survived, leading to a "survivor bias" that might overestimate their overall quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Modern concrete production prioritizes cost-effectiveness. While stronger and longer-lasting concretes could be produced, they are generally not chosen due to higher costs and the typical expected lifespan of modern buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

## Modern Concrete Production

Modern concrete is made by mixing cement powder with aggregates like sand and gravel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. These aggregates are blasted from quarries, then ground to specific sizes and shapes, which are crucial for the resulting concrete's strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Rounded particles, like river sand, are preferred for better finishability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

When water is added to the dry cement mixture, it begins to dissolve the cement grains, releasing ions into solution, including calcium hydroxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. The most common compound in cement, tricalcium silicate, reacts with water to form interlocking crystals of calcium silicate hydrates and other minerals, which causes the concrete to harden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. This process is called cement hydration, and water is essential to the formation of these crystals; it does not evaporate but becomes part of the solid material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Environmental Impact

While concrete is indispensable for modern infrastructure, its production, particularly that of cement, contributes significantly to global carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. Cement production accounts for an estimated 8% of the total global CO2 emissions, surpassing the entire aviation sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. Addressing the [[environmental_impact_and_carbon_footprint_of_concrete_production | environmental impact of concrete production]] is a major challenge.

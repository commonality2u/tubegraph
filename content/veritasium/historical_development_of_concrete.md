Concrete is a critical man-made substance, used more than any other material on the planet except water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Each year, 500 kilograms of cement are produced for every person on Earth, enough to make two cubic meters of concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. It is used as much as all other materials combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Concrete's widespread use is due to its properties: it's "liquid rock" that can be poured into any shape, is strong, durable, inexpensive, and easy to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. People have been making versions of it for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## [[difference_between_cement_and_concrete | Cement vs. Concrete]]

A common misconception is mixing up cement and concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Cement** acts as the "glue" or matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Concrete** is cement mixed with aggregate, such as gravel and sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Primitive Cement

The key ingredient for primitive cement is limestone, which is primarily calcium carbonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
1.  Heating limestone to around 1,000 degrees Celsius drives off CO2, leaving calcium oxide (quicklime) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
2.  Grinding the calcium oxide and mixing it with water results in an exothermic reaction, creating calcium hydroxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
3.  This mixture can be poured into a mold, and over time, it absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere, turning back into calcium carbonate as water evaporates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Drawbacks of Primitive Cement
This early method had several drawbacks:
*   Molds couldn't be very large, as CO2 couldn't penetrate deep enough to harden all the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   It would not work underwater, where there is no CO2 for the mixture to harden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Roman Concrete

The Romans discovered solutions to these problems by adding volcanic ash, called pozzolana, to crushed limestone before heating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This created a much stronger and more durable cement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Notable examples of Roman concrete usage include:
*   The Pantheon, the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world, which has stood for 2,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Concrete piers built into the sea, which hardened underwater and some of which are still standing today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The recipe for Roman concrete was lost for centuries until it was rediscovered in a book in a Swiss monastery in the 1400s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Why Roman Concrete Worked So Well
The remarkable strength, durability, and ability of Roman cement to set underwater came from the pozzolana (volcanic ash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This was because these materials contain silica, which fundamentally changes the [[chemical_composition_and_properties_of_concrete | chemistry of the cement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Silica enables the cement to harden without needing to dry; in fact, the water becomes an integral part of the hardened concrete, allowing it to achieve maximum strength when setting underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Additionally, Roman concrete was less well-mixed than modern concrete, leaving small blocks of undissolved calcium oxide (quicklime) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. When cracks formed and water entered, it dissolved the calcium oxide, forming calcium hydroxide, which then led to new growth of calcium carbonate. This process made Roman concrete self-healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

### [[comparison_of_roman_and_modern_concrete | Roman vs. Modern Concrete]]
While Roman concrete had surprising advantages like self-healing properties, it is not broadly superior to modern concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The perception of Roman concrete's superiority is influenced by "survivor bias," as only the structures that have lasted for millennia are still visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Modern concrete can be made incredibly strong and long-lasting, but it's often not done due to cost-effectiveness and the expected lifespan of contemporary buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

## Modern Concrete: Portland Cement

Today, virtually all concrete is made with a cement formulation discovered in the 1840s, known as Portland cement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. The name "Portland cement" was a marketing term, claiming its gray color resembled desirable rocks quarried near Portland, England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

Portland cement is made by:
1.  Crushing limestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
2.  Mixing it with a percentage of shale or clay to provide silicates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
3.  Grinding this mixture into a fine powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
4.  Heating it in a kiln to very high temperatures, producing hard nodules called clinker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

While clinker was historically considered waste due to its hardness, grinding it down produces cement far superior to other chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. The most common compound in Portland cement is tricalcium silicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

## Concrete Composition and Production

Beyond cement, concrete requires aggregates like sand and gravel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. These are blasted from quarries, then ground and sorted into specific sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The shape of the aggregate affects the concrete's strength and finishability; rounded particles (like river sand) are preferred for easier finishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Lightweight aggregates can also be incorporated to reduce the concrete's weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

At a concrete plant, aggregates are weighed and poured into mixer trucks according to a precise recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

## [[chemical_composition_and_properties_of_concrete | How Concrete Hardens]]

Concrete hardens through a process called cement hydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>:
1.  Water is added to the dry mixture of gravel, sand, and cement powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
2.  Water dissolves the cement powder grains, releasing ions into solution, including calcium hydroxide, which makes the concrete a very basic solution (pH up to 12 or 13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Fresh concrete can dissolve skin cells due to its high pH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
3.  As the tricalcium silicate (most common compound in cement) reacts with water, crystals of calcium silicate hydrates and other hydrate minerals begin to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
4.  These crystals grow and interlock, causing the concrete to harden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. Water is essential to this process and becomes part of the solid concrete material; it does not simply evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

Freshly poured concrete should be kept in a damp environment to ensure proper hydration and maximum strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. For example, in dry climates like Las Vegas, misters are used to maintain high humidity around new concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

### Concrete Strength Testing
Concrete suppliers cast sample cylinders of the material from job sites to test its strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Samples are cured in 100% humidity, often submerged in a lime bath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Strength increases over time, with tests typically conducted at 7, 14, and 28 days, when it's considered to have reached full strength (though it continues strengthening thereafter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Samples are broken in a hydraulic press, with pressure gradually increased until failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Surprisingly, pure cement, cement with sand, and cement with sand and gravel (normal concrete mix) all break under similar pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. While cement is the "glue," adding aggregates doesn't significantly reduce strength. Since cement is the most expensive component, reducing it to about 30% of the mix while maintaining strength is cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Aggregates also improve the concrete's cohesion, preventing flaking and chipping under load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

### Consistency and Setting Time
Before pouring, concrete consistency is adjusted using modern chemicals like superplasticizers, which make it easier to work without significantly altering water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. A "slump test" or "spread test" is used to ensure the right consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

Concrete typically hardens within about four hours without agitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. This is why concrete truck drums continuously turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. In emergencies, adding sugar (like from soda) can prevent setting for a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

## [[environmental_impact_of_cement_and_concrete | Environmental Impact]]

Concrete is responsible for an estimated 8% of global CO2 emissions, more than the entire aviation sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. Efforts are being made to address this through various carbon reduction projects and advocacy for systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

## A Surprising Origin

Limestone, the core component of cement and concrete, originates from the skeletons and shells of ancient sea organisms that died millions of years ago and were then compressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. This means that major infrastructure like skyscrapers and overpasses are, in essence, built from ancient marine life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

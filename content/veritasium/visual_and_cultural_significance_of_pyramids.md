The Great Pyramid of Giza held the record as the tallest man-made structure for nearly 4,000 years, only being surpassed by the Eiffel Tower in 1889 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Its enduring height speaks to its profound historical and visual impact.

## Enduring Mystery and Speculation
The construction of the pyramids over 4,500 years ago is particularly impressive, given that ancient Egyptians did not possess wheels or steel; copper and its alloys were the only metals available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The precise methods of their construction remain unknown, as no plans have survived, contributing to the structures' mysterious allure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This lack of information has fueled countless conspiracy theories, including those involving aliens, time travel, or lost technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Debunking the Slave Myth
A widely accepted, though less far-fetched, [[myths_and_misconceptions_about_pyramid_builders|myth regarding the pyramid builders]] is that they were slaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. However, recent discoveries, including well-preserved tombs near the pyramids, suggest that the builders were not slaves but rather skilled workers whose labor and sacrifice were honored with respectful burials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Original Appearance and Symbolism
While the pyramids have significantly weathered over millennia, their original appearance was far more striking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. They were originally covered with a brighter white limestone, giving them a smooth finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The very top of the pyramids may have been covered with electrum, an alloy of gold and silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

The shape of the pyramids is not arbitrary; it was designed to represent sun rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Imagining the pyramids upon their initial construction, with a shiny metallic top and smooth white sides, reveals what would have been a truly spectacular and symbolically rich sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

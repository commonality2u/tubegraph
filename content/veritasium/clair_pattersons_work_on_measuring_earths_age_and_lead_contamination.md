Clair Patterson, a single scientist, played a pivotal role in revealing widespread environmental contamination and accurately determining the age of the Earth. His work exemplifies [[the_role_of_individual_scientists_in_largescale_environmental_changes | the significant impact individual scientists]] can have on public health and the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Early Career and the Manhattan Project

In 1944, after completing his Master's degree, Patterson worked on the Manhattan Project, focusing on building the first nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. His specific task was to concentrate uranium-235 from the more common uranium-238 using large mass spectrometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This experience with mass spectrometry would prove crucial in his later research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Measuring the Age of the Earth

After World War II, Patterson pursued his PhD and chose a research project that leveraged his mass spectrometry skills: measuring the age of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Radioactive Clocks

Patterson understood that [[radioactivity_in_everyday_objects_and_environments | radioactive rocks act as effective clocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. For instance, Uranium-238 undergoes a series of 14 decays, eventually stabilizing as lead-206 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The decay rate is consistent, with half of a U-238 sample decaying into lead-206 over 4.5 billion years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. His goal was to determine the Earth's age by measuring the ratio of uranium to lead in primordial rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Unexpected Lead Contamination

To calibrate his instruments, Patterson initially used zircon crystals, which are ideal because they contain trace amounts of uranium but no lead when formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Therefore, any lead found in zircon must be a product of uranium decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. While his colleague George Tilton's uranium measurements were accurate, Patterson's lead measurements were erratic and significantly higher than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This mystery of "extra lead" would consume the rest of his life's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## The Source of the Lead: Leaded Gasoline

The widespread lead contamination Patterson encountered was largely due to the invention of leaded gasoline by [[thomas_midgley_jr_and_the_invention_of_tetraethyl_lead | Thomas Midgley Jr.]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Midgley's discovery of tetraethyl lead as an anti-knock agent for internal combustion engines led to its mass production and marketing as "Ethyl" fuel, without explicit mention of lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Despite initial worker illnesses and deaths from lead poisoning at manufacturing plants, and warnings from doctors and public health officials about lead being a "creeping and malicious poison," these concerns were dismissed by corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. By the 1950s, millions of motorists globally were burning lead in their cars, releasing it into the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This atmospheric lead was contaminating Patterson's samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Inventing the Cleanroom and Dating the Earth

Suspicious of environmental contamination, Patterson moved to Caltech in 1952 and built a new, meticulously clean lab from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. He removed lead solder from electrical cables, cleaned surfaces daily with ammonia, maintained constant outward airflow, and required plastic bunny suits for entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Patterson effectively invented the modern cleanroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

Within this controlled environment, he turned his attention to meteorites, which are pristine rocks from the early solar system that formed at the same time as Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. By measuring five meteorites using three different radiometric dating techniques, he determined their age to be 4.55 billion years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This figure is remarkably close (within 0.15%) to the currently accepted age of Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

## Unmasking Environmental Lead Pollution

Having accurately dated the Earth, Patterson shifted his focus to understanding the extent of lead contamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Corporations argued that lead was a natural part of the environment, but Patterson used his skills to challenge this claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

### Ocean and Ice Core Studies

He began by measuring lead concentrations in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. He found that lead concentrations were nearly 10 times higher near the surface, indicating recent pollution rather than natural distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

To track historical lead levels, Patterson analyzed ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. These cores showed elevated lead levels in the atmosphere for the last 4,500 years, primarily due to human activities like smelting ores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. The data revealed the rise and fall of ancient empires, the dip caused by the Black Death, and a massive spike in the 20th century due to industrialization and tetraethyl lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

### Human Lead Levels

Patterson also compared lead levels in the teeth and bones of recently deceased Americans with those of Peruvian and Egyptian mummies from over 1,600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. He expected a 100-fold difference but found that 20th-century Americans had nearly 1,000 times more lead in their bones than their ancestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

## The Devastating [[Impact of Leaded Gasoline on Public Health and Environment | Impact of Leaded Gasoline]]

Patterson's work, along with subsequent studies, exposed the severe consequences of widespread lead exposure.

### Health and Cognitive Decline

Lead, which mimics calcium in the body, is highly toxic, especially to the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. It damages myelin sheaths and prevents neurotransmitter release, leading to symptoms like headaches, memory loss, and tingling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Children are particularly vulnerable; lead exposure, even below levels once considered safe, causes permanent learning disorders, decreased IQ, and behavioral problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Studies showed higher lead levels in baby teeth correlated with increased likelihood of failing high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. The CDC's acceptable lead level in children's blood has dropped from 60 to 3.5 micrograms per deciliter, with no known safe level today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

Globally, lead is linked to nearly two-thirds of unexplained intellectual disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. A 2022 study estimated that over half the current US population (170 million people) were exposed to high lead levels in early childhood, resulting in an aggregate loss of more than 800 million IQ points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

### Crime Rates

There is a striking correlation between preschool blood lead levels (offset by 20 years) and the rise and fall of crime rates in the US, Britain, Canada, and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Research indicates a causal link between lead exposure and antisocial or violent behavior; a study of teenagers found those arrested were four times more likely to have elevated lead in their bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

### Mortality

Lead exposure also causes hardening of the arteries, leading to increased cardiovascular disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. A 2018 study attributed 250,000 heart disease deaths per year in the US to lead, potentially amounting to 25 million deaths in the US alone over the past century, and possibly 100 million globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. These deaths are largely attributable to the decision to add lead to gasoline for profit, despite known toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

## Legacy and Continued Efforts

Thanks to Patterson's unwavering advocacy and scientific evidence, countries began banning leaded fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Japan was the first in 1986, and Algeria was the last in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. The United Nations calculates that the elimination of lead from gasoline saves over a million lives per year and $2.45 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

However, leaded gasoline is still used in piston-driven airplane engines, which are now the largest source of lead emissions into the air in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. Current estimates of deaths caused by lead range from 500,000 to 900,000 per year, with a 2020 UNICEF report indicating that over 800 million children globally have elevated blood lead levels, much of which still traces back to Midgley's invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

Patterson's relentless pursuit of truth against industrial opposition highlights the [[importance_of_environmental_monitoring | critical importance of environmental monitoring]] and the power of scientific integrity to effect massive positive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

Invisible phenomena can trigger significant, seemingly inexplicable events, such as planes plummeting or election recounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These occurrences are often linked to "bit flips" in electronic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Case Study: Belgian Election Glitch (2003)

On May 18, 2003, during elections in Belgium, a problem was detected in the results from Schaerbeek, a municipality in central Brussels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Voting was conducted on computers, a system used for over a decade, with magnetic cards serving as a backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. A candidate, Maria Vindevogel, received more votes than mathematically possible according to the preferential voting system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

A recount was triggered by feeding the magnetic cards back through the machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. After several hours, the vote totals for all candidates were identical to the original, except for Maria Vindevogel, whose recounted votes were 4,096 less than the original tally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Computer experts found no software bugs and could not replicate the error by testing the hardware, which appeared to be in perfect working order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The discrepancy of 4,096 votes was a significant clue, as it is exactly 2 to the power of 12, or the 13th bit in binary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This suggested that the 13th bit in the computer's vote tally for Maria Vindevogel had flipped from a zero to a one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This incident is an example of [[unexpected_glitches_in_voting_systems | unexpected glitches in voting systems]].

## Understanding Bit Flips (Single Event Upsets)

Computers operate using binary code, where strings of zeros and ones represent information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Each bit corresponds to a power of two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Physically, a bit is represented by the state of a transistor being either on (one) or off (zero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. A "bit flip" occurs when a bit spontaneously changes its state without intentional instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

This phenomenon is known as a **single event upset (SEU)**, a type of **soft error** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. It's considered "soft" because the device itself isn't damaged; the bit state has merely changed, and it can be erased and rewritten without permanent issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Early Discoveries: Intel's DRAM Issues

Belgian investigators found reports of similar issues from large computer companies dating back to the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. In 1978, Intel reported spontaneous bit flips (ones turning to zeros) in their 16 kilobit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

The problem was traced to the ceramic packaging of the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. A new manufacturing plant on the Green River in Colorado, built to meet skyrocketing demand for semiconductor packaging, was located downstream of an old uranium mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Radioactive atoms from the mill entered the river and subsequently contaminated the ceramic packaging for Intel's microchips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Even trace amounts of uranium and thorium were enough to cause issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

In DRAM, memory is stored as the presence or absence of electrons in a semiconductor well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Alpha particles emitted by uranium and thorium were energetic and ionizing enough to create electron-hole pairs in the silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. If an alpha particle struck the right place, it could create enough free charge carriers to cause electrons to accumulate in the well, flipping a bit from one to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

This problem was identified in the 1970s because chip components had been miniaturized to the point where a single alpha particle could produce enough charge to flip a bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Chip manufacturers subsequently became more careful to avoid radioactive materials in their microchips and packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Cosmic Rays: The Primary Culprit for Modern Bit Flips

Since the Belgian election bit flip was not caused by natural radioactivity in the computer, investigators suspected another source: cosmic rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Discovery of Cosmic Rays

After Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity in 1896, scientists sought ways to measure it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Theodore Wolf, using a gold leaf electrometer, observed a slight decrease in radiation at the top of the Eiffel Tower in 1910, despite expecting a much larger drop if radiation originated solely from Earth's soil and rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Austrian physicist Victor Hess extended this experiment in 1911 and 1912, conducting seven balloon flights up to 5,200 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. He found that while radiation initially dropped, it significantly increased above one kilometer, becoming several times greater than ground levels at his maximum height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Hess also observed that the readings were unaffected during a solar eclipse, leading him to conclude that the radiation was coming from space, not the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Victor Hess had discovered cosmic rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Nature and Origin of Cosmic Rays

Cosmic rays are not electromagnetic rays but high-energy particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Approximately 90% are protons, 9% are helium nuclei, and 1% are heavier nuclei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. While some originate from the sun (with comparatively low energy), high-energy cosmic rays come from exploding stars (supernovae) in our galaxy and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The highest energy particles are believed to originate from black holes, including supermassive black holes at galactic centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Their charged nature means they are deflected by magnetic fields in space, making their exact origin difficult to pinpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

The "OMG particle," detected on October 15, 1991, was a single subatomic particle with an energy of 51 joulesâ€”equivalent to a baseball traveling 100 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

### Cosmic Ray Showers

Primary cosmic rays rarely reach Earth's surface directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Instead, they collide with air molecules about 25 kilometers above the ground, creating new particles like pions, which then collide and decay into neutrons, protons, muons, electrons, positrons, and photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This process generates a cascade or "shower" of particles streaming towards Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

It is believed that one of these secondary particles struck a transistor in the Belgian election computer, causing the 13th bit to flip and giving Maria Vindevogel 4,096 extra votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### Observing Cosmic Rays and Their Effects

*   **Cloud Chambers**: In 1911, Charles Wilson perfected the cloud chamber, allowing the visualization of cosmic rays as they ionized gas, causing vapor to condense into visible droplets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Carl Anderson later used a cloud chamber to identify the positron (anti-electron) in 1932 and the muon in 1936, both found in cosmic rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Frequency of Bit Flips**: Cosmic rays are constantly triggering bit flips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. In 1996, IBM estimated that one bit flip occurs per month for every 256 megabytes of RAM, primarily caused by neutrons from cosmic ray showers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   **"Blue Screen of Death"**: A single event functional interrupt, such as a neutron striking a device, can alter its function and cause an entire process to hang, potentially leading to a blue screen of death on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Misconceptions**: While Toyota recalled millions of vehicles for unintended acceleration starting in 2009, NASA investigated and found that cosmic ray-induced bit flips in the electronic control system were likely not the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The main causes were sticky accelerator pedals, poorly fitted floor mats, and drivers mistaking the accelerator for the brake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Impact on Supercomputers**: Cosmic rays have caused crashes in supercomputers, particularly at higher elevations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Los Alamos National Labs, situated 2,200 meters above sea level, frequently deals with neutron-induced supercomputer crashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Their solution includes frequent auto-saves and neutron detectors throughout the facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **Increased Risk at Altitude**: At cruising altitude in a plane, the radiation from cosmic rays increases significantly (10 to 30 times higher chance of a single event upset), posing a risk to flight computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

### Case Study: Airbus A330 Incident (2008)

On October 7, 2008, an Airbus A330 flying from Singapore to Perth suddenly pitched down, diving 200 meters in 20 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. Passengers experienced negative 0.8 Gs, feeling as though the plane had flipped over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Minutes later, it dropped another 120 meters, injuring 119 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

The fault was linked to the first Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU), which provides critical data like airspeed, angle of attack, and altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This data is supplied in a 32-bit binary word, with the first eight bits identifying the data type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. It is suspected that a bit flip in these first eight bits caused altitude information to be mislabeled as angle of attack information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. This resulted in the plane attempting to correct a non-existent stall, pitching down sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Investigators concluded that a single event effect from a high-energy atmospheric particle striking an integrated circuit was a potential triggering event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

The Airbus A330 was built in 1992, before specific regulatory or manufacturer requirements for airborne systems to be resilient to single event effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

## Mitigation and Protection

*   **Redundancy**: The Space Shuttle, built with redundancy from the start, had four computers simultaneously running identical software for navigation and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. If one had a soft error, the other three would overrule it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. This setup also allowed tracking of bit flip frequency; one five-day mission (STS 48) recorded 161 separate bit flips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   **Radiation Hardening**: For missions to other planets, protecting electronics is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. The computer on the Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars, is a 20-year-old PowerPC launched in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. It is "radiation hardened," meaning its design, materials, circuits, and software are built to withstand 40 times the radiation of an ordinary computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. This technology has been used on over a dozen space missions since 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

## Broader Implications of Cosmic Rays

*   **Astronauts' Visual Flashes**: Astronauts in space sometimes report seeing flashes of light with their eyes closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. This is believed to be caused by heavy particles or bursts of energy from radiation passing through the eyeball or optic nerve, which the body registers as light flashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.
*   **Heliosphere's Protection**: The solar wind and particles streaming from the sun create a protective bubble called the heliosphere, which deflects and slows cosmic rays from interstellar space, shielding the solar system from ionizing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. This protection fluctuates with the sun's 11-year activity cycle, meaning the flux of cosmic rays on Earth is lower when the sun is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.
*   **Role in Evolution**: It has been hypothesized that cosmic rays may have played a significant role in the history of our planet by flipping bits not in electronics, but in the genetic codes of living organisms, thereby contributing to the variation on which natural selection acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

Maria Vindevogel was eventually elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives by people, not a particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. Her story serves as a reminder of the countless particles traversing the universe, capable of altering lives by passing through a tiny transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

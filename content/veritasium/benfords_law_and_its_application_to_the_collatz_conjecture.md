From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Benford's Law describes the phenomenon where, in many naturally occurring datasets, the digit 1 appears as the leading digit far more often than any other digit, with successively smaller frequencies for larger digits. This pattern has been observed in various contexts, including its application to the [[Collatz Conjecture overview | Collatz Conjecture]] sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Application to 3x+1 Sequences

To analyze [[Mathematical properties of 3x1 problem | 3x+1]] sequences using Benford's Law, one can examine the leading digit of each number within a sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. For a given "seed" number, the sequence of "hailstone numbers" is generated by applying the [[Collatz Conjecture overview | Collatz Conjecture]] rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>:
*   If the number is odd, multiply by three and add one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   If the number is even, divide by two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

By counting how many numbers in these sequences start with a one, two, three, and so on, a histogram can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. When this process is repeated for numerous starting numbers, the histogram eventually settles into a stable pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Observed Pattern

For the first billion sequences, it is found that the digit 1 is by far the most common leading digit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>:
*   Approximately 30% of all numbers start with one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   Around 17.5% start with two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   About 12% start with three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   The frequency decreases for higher digits, with fewer than 5% of numbers starting with nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Universality and Fraud Detection

This pattern, known as Benford's Law, is not exclusive to the [[Collatz Conjecture overview | Collatz Conjecture]]. It emerges in various real-world datasets, including:
*   Populations of countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   Values of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>
*   Physical constants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
*   Fibonacci numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>

Due to its prevalence, Benford's Law is even used to detect fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. If numbers on income tax forms adhere to Benford's Law, it suggests honesty; otherwise, it might indicate something is being hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. It can also be applied to spot irregularities in elections, provided it is used correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The law functions best when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude, a characteristic present in [[Mathematical properties of 3x1 problem | 3x+1]] sequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Limitations

Despite its intriguing application, Benford's Law cannot definitively determine whether all numbers in a [[Collatz Conjecture overview | Collatz sequence]] will ultimately fall into the four, two, one loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. While it reveals patterns in the distribution of leading digits, it does not provide insight into the ultimate behavior or termination of the sequences themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Most people do not know [[how_bicycles_work | how bicycles actually work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A common misconception is that the [[gyroscopic_stability_in_yoyos | gyroscopic effect]] of spinning wheels is the primary reason bicycles maintain stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. However, this is not the full truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## The Role of Steering in Balance
When riding a bicycle, turning does not simply involve pointing the handlebars in the desired direction, as it would in a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Steering a bicycle affects both the direction of travel and the rider's balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

To initiate a turn, a rider must first steer momentarily in the opposite direction, a technique known as [[countersteering_in_bicycles | countersteering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. For example, to turn right, one must first counter-steer to the left to lean into the right turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This intuitive action allows the rider to lean their body into the turn, shifting the [[mechanics_of_weight_distribution | weight]] and maintaining balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Riders constantly make small steering adjustments to maintain balance, even when riding in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, similar to balancing an inverted pendulum like a broomstick on one's hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

The fundamental takeaway is that steering is not just for turning the bike, but crucially for balancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Why Stationary Bikes Are Hard to Balance
It is difficult to balance on a stationary bicycle because steering, which is essential for maintaining balance, does not work when the bike is not moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Balance comes from steering the bike to keep it underneath the rider, rather than solely from body positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Self-Stability of Riderless Bicycles
While many believe [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | spinning wheels]] and their gyroscopic effect are solely responsible for a bike's ability to stay upright, this is largely a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. When the handlebars are completely locked, preventing steering, a bicycle cannot be kept upright for more than a few seconds, even with the wheels spinning rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This demonstrates that it is just as hard to balance a bike with locked steering as it is to balance a stationary bike, because steering cannot be used to keep the bike underneath the rider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

The true reason bicycles can stay upright and coast indefinitely without a rider is because they are ingeniously designed to [[selfsteering_mechanisms_in_bicycles | steer themselves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. If a bike begins to fall to one side, the handlebars automatically turn in that direction, steering the wheels back underneath the bike to correct its balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

At least three mechanisms contribute to a bike's corrective steering:
1.  **Caster Effect**: The angle of the front fork causes the steering axis to intersect the ground ahead of where the front wheel touches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This design makes the front wheel act like a caster wheel, pushing it to turn in the direction of any lean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
2.  **Mass Distribution**: The center of [[mechanics_of_weight_distribution | mass]] of the handlebars and front wheel assembly is located slightly in front of the steering axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. When the bike leans, their [[mechanics_of_weight_distribution | weight]] helps to push the front wheel in the direction of the lean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
3.  **Gyroscopic Effect**: While not directly keeping the bike upright, the [[gyroscopic_precession_and_its_effects | gyroscopic effect]] of the spinning wheels assists in steering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This phenomenon, known as [[gyroscopic_precession_and_its_effects | gyroscopic precession]], means that a force applied to one side of a spinning wheel causes it to turn 90 degrees from where the force was applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. In a bicycle, this effect helps the wheels steer into a lean.

### Experiments and Research
Researchers have built unusual bicycles to demonstrate that not all three mechanisms are required for stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. One prototype featured [[countersteering_in_bicycles | counter-rotating wheels]] above the main wheels to nullify the [[gyroscopic_stability_in_yoyos | gyroscopic effect]] and was designed without a caster effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Despite this, the bike remained stable primarily due to its [[mechanics_of_weight_distribution | mass distribution]], where the force of gravity steers it into any lean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

[[how_bicycles_work | Understanding how bicycles work]] is still an active area of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This research is leading to innovations such as bicycles with smart motors in the handlebars that actively assist steering to maintain upright stability, even at low speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

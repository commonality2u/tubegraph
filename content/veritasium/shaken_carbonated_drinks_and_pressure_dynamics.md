Contrary to popular belief, shaking a sealed carbonated drink does not immediately increase the pressure within the bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This phenomenon has perplexed scientists, with even *New Scientist* publishing an incorrect explanation in 1986 suggesting pressure increase was the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Pressure Equilibrium in Sealed Bottles

When a bottle of soda sits undisturbed, the dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in the liquid reaches an [[wave_physics_and_properties | equilibrium]] with the CO2 gas in the headspace above the liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This [[wave_physics_and_properties | equilibrium]] state is determined by the temperature and the gas pressure in the headspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. For most soda bottles, this [[wave_physics_and_properties | equilibrium]] pressure is approximately 3 atmospheres or 330 kiloPascals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Shaking a sealed bottle does not alter this [[wave_physics_and_their_properties | equilibrium]] pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. A demonstration using a pressure gauge showed that after vigorous shaking, the internal pressure remained constant at about 3 atmospheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## The Role of Nucleation Sites

The true reason a shaken carbonated drink "explodes" upon opening is related to the creation of [[nucleation_sites_and_their_role_in_fizzy_drinks | nucleation sites]] within the liquid, rather than an increase in internal pressure of the sealed bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### What Happens When You Shake?

When you shake a carbonated drink, you introduce tiny air bubbles into the liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. These bubbles act as [[nucleation_sites_and_their_role_in_fizzy_drinks | nucleation sites]], making it significantly easier for the dissolved CO2 to come out of solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### What Happens When You Open?

When the bottle is opened, the external pressure drops from 3 atmospheres to 1 atmosphere (ambient pressure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. At this lower pressure, the dissolved CO2 is no longer at [[wave_physics_and_properties | equilibrium]] and wants to rapidly come out of solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

The tiny air bubbles, introduced by shaking and clinging to the bottle walls, contribute to the "explosion" in two ways:
1.  **Expansion**: They expand rapidly due to the sudden decrease in pressure, pushing the liquid upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
2.  **Nucleation**: They act as [[nucleation_sites_and_their_role_in_fizzy_drinks | nucleation sites]], causing the dissolved CO2 to rapidly form more bubbles, leading to a quick and voluminous release of gas and liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Disarming a Shaken Beverage

To avoid a messy explosion, a shaken carbonated beverage can be "disarmed" by flicking the walls of the bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This action helps to dislodge the bubbles clinging to the sides, preventing them from acting as [[nucleation_sites_and_their_role_in_fizzy_drinks | nucleation sites]] when the bottle is opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Other Sources of Nucleation Sites

[[nucleation_sites_and_their_role_in_fizzy_drinks | Nucleation sites]] can be introduced in other ways besides shaking:

*   **Mentos**: The rough surface of a Mentos candy provides abundant [[nucleation_sites_and_their_role_in_fizzy_drinks | nucleation sites]], causing CO2 to rapidly come out of solution and create a soda fountain effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Paper Straws**: Preliminary analysis suggests that paper straws create more bubbles in carbonated drinks than plastic straws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This is likely due to their porous surface providing more [[nucleation_sites_and_their_role_in_fizzy_drinks | nucleation sites]], making the drink fizzier as it comes up the straw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

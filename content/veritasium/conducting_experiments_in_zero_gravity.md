[[experiencing_weightlessness_for_the_first_time | Experiencing weightlessness]] is described as a "freaky" and "incredible" sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The experience takes place in a Zero-G plane in France, where the speaker was invited by YouTuber Bruce and joined by Diana Physics Girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The flight involves flying "parabolas" to achieve zero gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## [[the_physics_behind_creating_zero_gravity_environments | Achieving Zero Gravity]]

The core principle behind [[the_physics_behind_creating_zero_gravity_environments | weightlessness]] is that the plane and everything inside it accelerate towards the Earth at the same rate as a freely falling object in a vacuum, which is 9.8 meters per second squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This means there is no contact force between objects within the falling environment, making them feel weightless, similar to a pen inside a falling bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

Contrary to what might be intuitive, this is not achieved by simply diving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Instead, the plane begins to climb at a steadily increasing angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Once the plane is climbing at approximately 50 degrees, the engines are reduced, and the plane is put into a parabolic trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It is at this point that [[experiencing_weightlessness_for_the_first_time | weightlessness]] begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. During the parabola, both the plane and its occupants are still moving upward but are simultaneously accelerating downward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The pilots must skillfully adjust thrust to counteract air resistance and maintain this exact acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. A single period of [[experiencing_weightlessness_for_the_first_time | weightlessness]] lasts about 22 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

In addition to thirteen zero-g parabolas, the flight included one [[exercising_and_maintaining_health_in_low_gravity_environments | Martian gravity]] parabola and two [[exercising_and_maintaining_health_in_low_gravity_environments | Moon gravity]] parabolas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_microgravity_and_its_effects_on_the_human_body | Effects of Hyper-Gravity]]

Before entering the parabolic trajectory, during the climb, passengers experience hyper-gravity, feeling a force 1.8 times their body weight pressing them into the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This condition makes standing difficult and causes blood to drain from the head into the feet, leading to dizziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. To combat motion sickness, also why this flight is sometimes called the "vomit comet," passengers are advised to lie on their backs and avoid moving their heads, as the vestibular system becomes hypersensitive in hyper-G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Experiments in Zero Gravity

The flight was used to conduct several experiments to observe physical phenomena under different gravitational conditions.

### [[effects_of_zero_gravity_on_fire_and_flames | Flame Behavior]]

Flames typically have a distinctive shape on Earth due to gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The products of combustion are hotter and less dense than the surrounding air, creating a buoyant force that causes the hot air to rise, pulling in oxygen to sustain the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

*   **In 1G**: Flames exhibit their familiar upward-pointing shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **In Hyper-G**: This effect is magnified, as the greater gravitational force amplifies the weight difference between hot and cool air, causing the hot air to rise faster and resulting in a longer flame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **In Zero-G**: There is much less buoyant force, leading to a less efficient combustion and noticeable smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The flame appears strange and is not circular or spherical due to the continuous gas flow from the lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Without this flow, a flame in zero-g would form a sphere, as seen on the International Space Station, where combustion is difficult to maintain due to combustion products hindering oxygen access to the fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Observing a flame's shape can indicate the gravitational acceleration of an environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Slinky Dynamics

An experiment involving a slinky was performed to observe its behavior in zero gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Since the slinky could not dangle under its own weight, it was swung around the head to stretch it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Each coil stretches to provide the tension needed to keep the slinky accelerating in uniform circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

When the slinky was released, it remained fairly stretched out and continued rotating at roughly the same frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This occurs because its stretch was due to rotation, not weight. Since it continued rotating after being released, the same tension was required to maintain its circular motion, preventing it from contracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. In zero-G, a stretched slinky can rotate in place without contracting as long as the tension provides the centripetal force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This observation challenges common intuition, which is primarily formed from experiences within a gravitational environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

[[experiencing_weightlessness_for_the_first_time | Being weightless]] is an unforgettable experience, particularly valuable for how it challenges intuition, highlighting the necessity of conducting research in zero gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

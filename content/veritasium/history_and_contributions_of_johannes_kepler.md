Johannes Kepler, a renowned scientist, lived and worked in Prague over 400 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. He is one of the most famous scientists associated with the city, which houses the Kepler Museum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Key Contributions and Ideas

Kepler's significant contributions and intellectual pursuits are central to the [[history of physics and mathematics discoveries | history of physics and mathematics]].

### Planetary Orbits and Platonic Solids
Kepler is most famous for discovering that the shapes of planetary orbits are ellipses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Before this realization, he developed a model of the solar system where planets were on nested spheres, separated by the Platonic solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Platonic solids are geometric objects where all faces and all vertices are identical, allowing them to look the same when rotated through certain angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The five Platonic solids are:
*   The cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   The tetrahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   The octahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   The dodecahedron (12 pentagonal sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   The icosahedron (20 sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

Conveniently, in Kepler's time, only six planets were known, allowing him to place a unique Platonic solid between each of the six planetary spheres, essentially using them as spacers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. He carefully ordered them so that the distances between planets matched astronomical observations as closely as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This model stemmed from his deep belief in some geometric regularity governing the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Kepler's Conjecture on Sphere Packing
Kepler's interest in geometry extended to practical problems, such as how to stack cannonballs efficiently on a ship's deck to minimize space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. By 1611, he proposed that hexagonal close packing and the face-centered cubic arrangement are the most efficient ways to stack spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. In these arrangements, cannonballs occupy approximately 74% of the volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

This proposition, known as Kepler's conjecture, was not formally proven by him, though it appeared to be the obvious method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. It took about 400 years for a formal proof to be published in the *Journal of Formalized Mathematics* in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### "On the Six-Cornered Snowflake"
Kepler published his conjecture in a pamphlet titled "Deniva Sexangula" (On the Six-Cornered Snowflake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. In it, he pondered why snowflakes invariably display a six-cornered starlet shape, questioning why they don't fall with five or seven corners if it happens by chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

At the time, there was no comprehensive theory of atoms, molecules, or crystal self-arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. However, Kepler seemed on the verge of understanding this, speculating about the smallest natural unit of water (essentially a water molecule) and how these tiny units could mechanically stack to form the hexagonal crystal, similar to hexagonal close-packed cannonballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Tiling the Plane and Pentagonal Symmetry
Kepler recognized that regular hexagons can perfectly cover a flat surface without gaps, a concept known as tiling the plane periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Periodic tilings allow for duplication of a portion and continuation of the pattern through translation, without rotations or reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. They can also exhibit rotational symmetry:
*   Rhombus pattern: two-fold symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   Equilateral triangles: three-fold symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
*   Squares: four-fold symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>
*   Hexagons: six-fold symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>

Notably, two, three, four, and six are the only possible rotational symmetries for periodic tilings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Regular pentagons do not tile the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

Despite this, Kepler attempted to tile the plane with regular pentagons, publishing a pattern in his book *Harmonics Mundi* (Harmony of the World) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This pattern displayed a "certain five-fold symmetry," though it wasn't entirely clear how it could be continued to tile the entire plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Connection to Penrose Tilings
Remarkably, if Kepler's pentagon pattern is overlaid on top of [[Roger Penrose's contributions to aperiodic tilings | Penrose's pattern]], the two match up perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This highlights Kepler's early intuitive understanding of patterns that would later be formally explored through the development of aperiodic tilings and quasi-crystals.

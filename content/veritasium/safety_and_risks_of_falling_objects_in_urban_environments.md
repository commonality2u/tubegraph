From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Falling objects pose various risks in urban environments, ranging from harmless everyday occurrences to potentially lethal incidents. The danger an object presents upon impact is primarily determined by its mass, shape, and the effects of air resistance, which dictates its terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

## The Penny Myth: Empire State Building Drop

A common urban legend suggests that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could be lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Empire State Building stands 443 meters tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. If air resistance were ignored, a penny (weighing about 2.5 grams, half to a quarter the weight of a bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>) could theoretically accelerate to over 300 kilometers per hour by the time it hits the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. However, this is not what happens in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

The video conducted an experiment with original MythBuster Adam Savage, who dropped pennies from a helicopter onto a person below, simulating the fall from the Empire State Building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Despite initial apprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> and the helicopter's downdraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, the pennies, while stinging a little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> and feeling like "tiny little bullets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, were not dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The myth of [[impact_of_dropping_a_penny_from_a_skyscraper | a deadly penny from a skyscraper]] was busted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## The Science of Falling Objects

The reason a penny is not deadly is due to **air resistance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
Air resistance is proportional to the speed squared of an object and the density of the air it moves through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

### Terminal Velocity

When the force of gravity pulling an object down equals the force of air resistance pushing it up, the object reaches its **terminal velocity**, meaning it no longer accelerates and falls at a constant speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

*   **Experiment:** A classic demonstration shows a hammer and a feather dropped on the Moon, where both fall at the same rate due to the near vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. On Earth, the hammer lands much faster because its weight is significantly greater than the drag it experiences, while the feather quickly reaches its terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Factors influencing terminal velocity:**
    *   **Weight to Air Resistance Ratio:** This ratio determines an object's terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Heavier objects of the same size and shape will have a higher terminal velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   **Shape and Cross-sectional Area:** Air resistance depends on the object's cross-sectional area and its overall shape, captured by the **Drag Coefficient** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Aerodynamic shapes (lower drag coefficient) experience less resistance, allowing them to reach higher speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
    *   **Air Density:** The terminal velocity is higher in less dense air, such as at higher altitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Felix Baumgartner, for example, reached over 1300 kilometers per hour during his stratospheric jump due to the lack of air at that altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

Pennies reach their terminal velocity (around 80 kilometers per hour) after falling only about 15 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This means dropping them from a greater height, like the Empire State Building, would not increase their speed upon impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Pennies also tumble and oscillate between two different terminal velocities (on their face and on their edge), making them difficult to aim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## Other Falling Objects and Their Lethality

### Ballpoint Pens

Another myth suggests that ballpoint pens falling from a skyscraper could be lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Plastic ballpoint pens weigh about twice as much as a penny and have a smaller cross-sectional area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. However, an experiment using a ballistics gel dummy showed that these pens still have too much drag relative to their weight to achieve a high terminal velocity and were not dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Narrow metal pens might pose a greater risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

### Bullets

When a bullet is simply dropped from a skyscraper, it does not maintain its aerodynamic shape and will tumble, likely falling on its side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. This increases air resistance, meaning it would reach a much slower terminal velocity than if it were fired from a gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Similarly, a bullet fired straight up will slow down, stop at its peak (up to three kilometers high), and then fall back down tumbling, reaching the ground much slower than its launch speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

However, if a bullet is fired at an angle, it maintains its horizontal velocity and spin, keeping it pointy-side forwards. This allows it to speed up to a significant fraction of its launch speed as it returns to the ground, posing a much greater danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Celebratory gunfire, for example, has caused hundreds of accidental deaths worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

### Natural Phenomena: Rain vs. Hail

Raindrops fall through the thicker air of the troposphere and have a low terminal velocity of just 25 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. They are typically spherical but flatten on the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Larger raindrops can break up into smaller droplets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Hail, in contrast, can be much more dangerous. Hailstones can reach terminal velocities of over 200 kilometers per hour, about 10 times that of rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This is because hail can grow much larger than raindrops, with some measured up to 20 centimeters in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Since weight scales with radius cubed and drag with radius squared, larger hailstones have a higher terminal velocity and carry more kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Hail injures around 20 people and causes about four fatalities annually in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### [[historical_and_modern_use_of_falling_objects_as_weapons | Historical and Modern Projectiles]]

The concept of dropping deadly projectiles from above is almost as old as aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

*   **Flechettes:** In World War I, small metal darts called "fl√©chettes" (French for "little arrow") were dropped from planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. These "nails with little feathers" were designed to fall straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a> and could be up to 15 centimeters long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. They were cheap, didn't require explosives, and could pierce helmets, causing severe injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Lazy Dogs:** Later, the US developed similar but heavier weapons called Lazy Dogs, used in the Korean and Vietnam wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. While their damage was indiscriminate, they didn't leave unexploded ordnance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
*   **Modern Use:** Militaries continue to use kinetic projectiles for precision strikes today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

### Everyday Urban Hazards

Falling objects in civilian life also pose significant dangers. Nearly 700 Americans die each year from being struck by falling objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. These include:

*   Loose tiles and bricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>
*   Falling construction tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>
*   Falling rocks and tree branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>
*   Icicles: A serious concern, as demonstrated by the closure of streets around New York's One World Trade Center in 2014 due to the danger of falling icicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
*   A man was killed in 2014 by a measuring tape that fell 50 stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

## Quantifying Lethality

The lower limit of kinetic energy required to fracture a human skull is approximately **68 Joules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Any object with kinetic energy greater than this threshold is very likely to cause a fatal injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

*   A raindrop at terminal velocity delivers only about 0.002 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   A falling penny delivers about 0.2 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   A baseball or the largest measured hailstone can deliver over 80 Joules, enough to crack a skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   The energy of a falling Flechette is not enough to crack a skull through blunt force trauma, but its ability to apply a large force to a very small area makes it dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

In summary, objects weighing only a few grams and lacking aerodynamic design are unlikely to be fatal when falling from great heights due to air resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. However, objects weighing more than a few hundred grams traveling at terminal velocity are likely to be deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

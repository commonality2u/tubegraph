After [[amelia_earharts_final_flight_and_disappearance | Amelia Earhart's final flight]], there are various theories regarding her fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02">[32:02]</a>. However, the prevailing evidence suggests that she ran out of fuel over the Pacific and crashed into the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:06">[32:06]</a>.

## Search and Rescue Operations
Following [[amelia_earharts_final_flight_and_disappearance | Earhart's]] last message, the Itasca ship departed Howland Island two hours later to search north and west for her Electra plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:14">[32:14]</a>. Other US Navy and Coast Guard ships and planes joined the search, which continued for over two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:21">[32:21]</a>.

This operation marked the most intensive and expensive search and rescue effort in US history up to that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26">[32:26]</a>. It cost approximately $4 million at the time, which is nearly $100 million in present-day currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:33">[32:33]</a>.

Despite the extensive search, no trace of [[role_and_impact_of_fred_noonan_in_earharts_journey | Fred Noonan]], [[amelia_earharts_final_flight_and_disappearance | Earhart]], or her Electra aircraft has ever been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40">[32:40]</a>.

The world's strongest continuous [[worlds_strongest_magnet | magnet]], located at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida, holds the Guinness World Record for its immense power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This magnet is capable of drawing objects in, generating electric currents, and even levitating non-magnetic objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Its powerful [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic fields]] are so intense they can interfere with camera equipment, redirecting electrons in CMOS sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Unprecedented Magnetic Field Strength

For context, the Earth's magnetic field is approximately 0.00005 Tesla, a fridge magnet is around 0.01 Tesla, and MRI machines can reach up to 3 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. In contrast, the world's strongest magnet generates a continuous magnetic field of 45 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, nearly a million times stronger than Earth's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

This powerful magnet is a hybrid system, combining an outer [[superconducting_and_resistive_magnets | superconducting magnet]] and an inner [[superconducting_and_resistive_magnets | resistive magnet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The superconducting outsert produces 11.5 Tesla, while the inner resistive magnet contributes 33.5 Tesla, adding up to 45 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

The highest magnetic field is concentrated within a narrow cylinder in the center of the two-story apparatus, roughly one centimeter tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This precise field is used for research on small samples, such as computer chips or cell phone components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Impacts on Materials

### Ferromagnetic Materials

Strong magnetic fields profoundly impact ferromagnetic materials. These are materials where electrons are not paired up and their atomic magnetic fields can align, and subsequently, domains within the material can align, creating a net magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Common ferromagnetic elements include iron, nickel, and cobalt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

*   **Attraction**: Objects containing ferromagnetic materials, like steel washers in a Nerf football, are strongly attracted to the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This attraction can be so powerful that a chair left too close was accelerated across a room, pulling out its "guts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Ferrofluid**: This liquid contains nanoscale magnetite particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. In a magnetic field, these particles align, forming parallel ridges meters away and spikes closer to the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The fluid will even climb the sides of its container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

The discovery of [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetism]] dates back at least 3000 years to Magnesia, Greece, where naturally magnetized magnetite pieces (lodestones) were found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. By the 11th century in China, magnets were used to create compass needles that always pointed North <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Non-Ferromagnetic Materials (Conductive)

The behavior of conductive non-ferromagnetic materials in a strong magnetic field is particularly striking:

*   **Eddy Currents and Lenz's Law**: When a conductive material, such as a metal plate, moves through a magnetic field, the changing magnetic flux induces electric currents (eddy currents) in the plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. These currents create their own magnetic field that opposes the original change in flux, a principle known as Lenz's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
    *   If a plate falls towards a north magnetic pole, the induced currents create a repelling north magnetic pole, significantly slowing its descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This process dissipates energy as heat, causing the plate to warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
    *   An electromagnetic levitator in Paris uses alternating currents to induce so much heat that water boils on a levitated plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
    *   This "No You Don't" Law means that if you try to pick up a plate, a south magnetic pole is induced, attracting it back to the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Demonstrations**:
    *   Aluminum cylinders dropped onto the magnet or rolled across it are strongly resisted by eddy currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
    *   A volleyball wrapped in aluminum foil dramatically decelerates when passed over or dropped into the magnet's field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
    *   Projectiles fired from a potato cannon across the field are rotated by induced eddy currents to align with magnetic field lines, minimizing flux change and slowing them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Some projectiles contained coils with LEDs that lit up, demonstrating the induced currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   **Superconductors**: Below their critical temperature, superconductors have zero electrical resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. When a magnet is brought near, currents are induced to oppose the flux change, and because there's no resistance, these currents persist indefinitely and expel all magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. This phenomenon is used in the "human levitator," where a 90-pound magnet hovers above a ring of superconductors, repelling the magnetic field from the person standing on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

### Non-Ferromagnetic Materials (Non-conductive)

All materials possess some magnetic properties, though they are usually only evident in very strong [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic fields]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

*   **Paramagnetism**: Some materials are always attracted to magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Liquid oxygen, for instance, is paramagnetic; its presence strengthens the overall magnetic field, causing attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Diamagnetism**: Most materials are repelled by sufficiently strong magnetic fields, regardless of polarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. This is known as diamagnetism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Water is a good example; in an external field, water molecules become opposing magnets and are repelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
    *   This repulsion can be used to levitate objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Objects like strawberries, raspberries, or plastic pizza can be levitated due to their water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
    *   Living organisms, containing significant water, can also be levitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Frogs and even mice have been levitated in experiments to study the effects of weightlessness without going to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

### Impacts on Living Things

While there are no lasting or long-term effects on living organisms from strong [[magnetic_fields_and_their_effects | magnetic fields]], there is a temporary phenomenon where the stones in the inner ear can become polarized, causing rodents to spin in circles for a few minutes after exiting the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## Applications and Future Research

Strong magnets are fundamental to future technologies and scientific discovery:

*   **Material Science and Kinetic Matter Research**: The powerful magnetic field allows for the study of very small samples, such as chips in computers or cell phones, for material science and kinetic matter research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Electric Vehicles**: Magnets are core to electric motors used in electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Sustainability and Clean Energy**: The demand for technologies that are less destructive to the planet drives research involving magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Companies like Google are committed to sustainability, matching 100% of their electricity use with renewable energy since 2017 and offering tools like Project Sunroof to encourage rooftop solar adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Extreme Environments for Material Discovery**: High magnetic fields, along with high electric fields, high pressure, and ultra-low temperatures, are used to explore new materials and understand their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. This includes improving the cleanliness of existing materials to reduce electron scattering and reveal new properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

## Operational Considerations and Costs

Operating the world's strongest magnets requires significant energy and infrastructure:

*   **Energy Consumption**: The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory consumes a substantial portion of Tallahassee's electricity, about 8% of the city's total generating capacity when all four power supplies are at full blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.
*   **Operational Costs**: The electricity budget for the facility is between $250,000 and $300,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. The facility operates within the city's federally mandated reserve, allowing Tallahassee to generate revenue from power it otherwise couldn't sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.
*   **Resistive Magnet Design**: Generating high fields with ordinary resistive wire is challenging due to heat dissipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. Francis Bitter's 1950s design solved this by smashing round wire into thin plates stacked with insulators, forming a helix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. This design allows cooling water to be pushed axially through the stack, removing heat from the innermost windings and enabling much higher currents (up to 57,000 amps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Material Failure**: Extreme forces and heat can cause material failure. Coils can plastically deform, shorting out and vaporizing metal, leading to expensive repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
*   **Global Presence**: As of the video, there are two such 45 Tesla hybrid magnets in the world; China recently commissioned one similar in concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

The development of such powerful magnets marks an inflection point in scientific discovery, with significant potential yet to be realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

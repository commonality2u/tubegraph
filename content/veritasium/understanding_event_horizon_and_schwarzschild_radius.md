The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) aims to image [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black holes]], specifically Sagittarius A* at the center of the Milky Way galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The resulting image, though appearing like a "fuzzy coffee mug stain," allows scientists to test the general theory of relativity in strong gravity regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Event Horizon

The **[[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]]** is a theoretical sphere representing the boundary around a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. It is defined as the location from which even light, when fired radially away, cannot be detected by an outside observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Once inside the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]], all "world lines" (paths through spacetime) inevitably lead to the singularity at the center of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]], meaning there is no escape, not even for light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Schwarzschild Radius

The radius of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] is known as the **[[schwarzschild_solution_and_singularities | Schwarzschild radius]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This value is crucial for understanding the scale of phenomena around a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]].

## Imaging and the Event Horizon

Directly imaging a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] is impossible if it has nothing around it, as it would absorb all electromagnetic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. However, [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black holes]] like Sagittarius A* are surrounded by an [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] of incredibly hot dust and gas, moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

The [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] does not extend all the way to the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. For a non-spinning [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]], the innermost stable circular orbit for matter is at three [[schwarzschild_solution_and_singularities | Schwarzschild radii]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Light, having no mass, can orbit much closer, at 1.5 [[schwarzschild_solution_and_singularities | Schwarzschild radii]], forming a "photon sphere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This photon sphere is an unstable orbit, meaning photons will eventually spiral into the singularity or escape to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### The Black Hole Shadow

The [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] drastically warps spacetime, causing [[how_light_behaves_around_black_holes | light rays to curve]] rather than travel in straight lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

*   **Dark Region**: Any light ray that crosses the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] will never be seen by an outside observer, creating a dark region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Light Bending**: Even light rays that approach just above the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]], or even at the distance of the photon sphere, can be bent by the intense gravity and end up crossing the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] and falling into the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **The Shadow's Edge**: For a light ray to reach an observer without falling into the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]], it must originate from at least 2.6 [[schwarzschild_solution_and_singularities | Schwarzschild radii]] away, where it will just graze the photon sphere at its closest approach before heading off to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This creates the "shadow" of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]], which is approximately 2.6 times larger than the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Seeing the Event Horizon

While the shadow is larger than the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]], the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] is located at the very center of this shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Due to the extreme bending of light, observers can actually see the entire backside of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] mapped onto a ring within the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. In essence, the shadow allows for a view of the entirety of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]]'s [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]], even though it appears completely black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

Furthermore, light can loop around the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] multiple times, producing infinite images of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] as one approaches the edge of the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The first visible light in the image comes from rays that graze the photon sphere before reaching telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

If viewed edge-on, the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]]'s warping of spacetime bends light rays from the back of the [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] over the top and bottom, making the back of the disk visible to the observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This can create images similar to depictions of [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black holes]] in popular media, such as the one in "Interstellar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Additionally, [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_black_holes | relativistic beaming]] or Doppler beaming causes the side of the [[accretion_disk_around_a_black_hole | accretion disk]] moving towards the observer to appear much brighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

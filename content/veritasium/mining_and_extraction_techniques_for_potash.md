[[the_history_and_importance_of_potash | Potash]] has been a prized substance throughout human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Its extraction methods have evolved significantly from ancient times to modern industrial processes.

## Early Methods: Potash from Ash

Historically, [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] was derived from wood ash. This method dates back at least 1,500 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

The process involved:
1.  Burning hardwood to produce ash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
2.  Placing the ash in a pot and adding water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
3.  The water-soluble chemical compounds in the ash would dissolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
4.  Straining out the solid particles, leaving a slippery solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
5.  Allowing the water to evaporate in the sun, which left behind a crystalline substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This substance was named [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] because of its origin from "pot ash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Chemically, this early [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] was potassium carbonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

[[the_historical_impact_of_potash_on_industry_and_technology | Potash]] was the primary chemical product of the early American colonies and a significant source of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. By 1788, Massachusetts alone had 250 [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] works, burning vast amounts of wood just for its ash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. The first U.S. patent, issued in 1790 and signed by George Washington, was for an improved [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] production process, highlighting its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. However, this method led to the decimation of forests in Europe and the eastern U.S. due to the large amount of lumber required for a small quantity of [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Underground Mining of Mineral Potash

A shift in [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] production occurred in 1861 when Germany began extracting potassium from rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This natural mineral form is potassium chloride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This discovery led to Germany establishing a near-monopoly on [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

During World War I, Germany cut off [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] exports, prompting the U.S. to search for domestic sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Significant deposits were found near Searles Lake, California; Carlsbad, New Mexico; and Moab, Utah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. These deposits were deep underground, requiring traditional mining techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

The [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] in areas like Moab, Utah, is found in the Paradox Formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This layer was formed by an inland ocean that repeatedly evaporated, leaving behind salt and other evaporites like [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Miners would scrape out the [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] and transport it to the surface via narrow-gauge rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

However, underground [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] mining carried significant risks. Salt formations can trap oil and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. A tragic explosion occurred in Moab on August 27, 1963, when 18 men died after combustible gas in the mine was ignited, likely by electric arcs, sparks, or an open flame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

> [00:12:02] Investigators concluded, the disaster was caused by the ignition of combustible gas by electric arcs, sparks, or an open flame.

The Davy lamp, invented by Sir Humphry Davy (also the discoverer of [[the_chemical_properties_and_reactions_of_potassium | potassium]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, was designed to prevent such explosions by dispersing heat from a flame rapidly enough to prevent igniting gas outside a wire mesh screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Mining is considered one of the most dangerous professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## Solution Mining and Evaporation Ponds

A safer method for extracting [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] was discovered in 1964 by a mining company in Saskatchewan, Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This technique, known as solution mining, involves:
1.  Pumping water from the Colorado River deep underground (approximately 3,900 feet) to the [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
2.  The water dissolves the [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] salt, creating a brine solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
3.  This brine solution is then pumped back to the surface and into large evaporation ponds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
4.  In the ponds, the water evaporates into the dry desert air, leaving behind the solid [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

These evaporation ponds, such as those near Moab, Utah, are a striking feature visible from above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. There are 23 ponds covering 400 acres, with each taking months to evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The color of the ponds changes over time: fresh ponds are deep blue, becoming seafoam green, and then tan as the water evaporates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Once the water is gone, a white crystalline substance, the [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]], remains and is scraped up by vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

The blue color of the ponds is due to added copper sulfate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This additive serves two purposes: it prevents the growth of algae and other organisms, and its dark color absorbs more sunlight, accelerating evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

This method allows for the harvesting of billions of dollars worth of [[potashs_role_in_agriculture_and_fertilizer_production | potash]] from deposits like the 2 billion tons found in the Paradox Basin alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, while eliminating the dangers of underground mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

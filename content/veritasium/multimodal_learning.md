Multimodal learning refers to educational approaches that present information using multiple sensory modalities, such as combining words with pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. This strategy is recognized for its effectiveness in improving learning outcomes for everyone, rather than being tailored to specific [[learning_styles_myth | learning styles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

## The Multimedia Effect

A significant body of [[research on learning preferences | literature]] supports the claim that everyone learns better with multimodal approaches compared to using words or pictures alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. This phenomenon is known as the multimedia effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. Videos, for instance, are considered powerful learning tools when their narration complements the visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. In introductory physics, explicit discussion of misconceptions was found to be essential in multimedia teaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

### Practical Demonstration
An informal experiment demonstrated this by having individuals recall items. Initially, most people remembered about five or six items when presented with either pictures or auditory cues alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. However, when words were presented alongside pictures, participants reported that it was "100%" easier and they could recall significantly more items, achieving a 50% improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

## Beyond Learning Styles

The concept of multimodal learning contrasts with the discredited idea of [[learning_styles_myth | learning styles]], which suggests that individuals learn better when information is presented in their specific preferred style (e.g., visual, auditory, reading-writing, or kinesthetic, as in the [[vark_model | VARK model]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Despite the popularity of [[learning_styles_myth | learning styles]] among teachers, rigorous studies consistently show no credible evidence that learning is improved when instruction matches a student's self-professed style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

Instead, the effectiveness of multimodal learning stems from how the human brain processes information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. What learners are ultimately intended to recall is the meaning behind presentations, not the precise nature of the images or sounds themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

### Core Principle
The most important factor for learning is not the presentation method, but what occurs inside the learner's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. People learn best when they are actively thinking about the material, engaging in problem-solving, or imagining different scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Contrary to the belief that individuals are exclusively visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learners, people are all of these types of learners combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. The most effective [[effective_teaching_methods | learning experiences]] involve multiple ways of understanding the same information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. This multimodal approach benefits everyone and is an evidence-based method that genuinely improves learning, unlike the [[learning_styles_myth | learning styles]] misconception, which can hinder effective teaching and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

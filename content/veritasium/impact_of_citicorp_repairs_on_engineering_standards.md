The discovery and subsequent repair of the [[citicorp_center_structural_flaw | Citicorp Center's structural flaw]] had a profound impact on building design, safety protocols, and the ethical standards of the engineering profession. The crisis, and its resolution, became a critical case study taught globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

## A Landmark Case for [[Engineering ethics and crisis management | Engineering Ethics]]

The actions of structural engineer Bill LeMessurier during the Citicorp crisis are widely regarded as a benchmark for [[Engineering ethics and crisis management | engineering ethics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. Despite the immense personal and professional risks, including potential ruin and mass panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, LeMessurier chose to reveal and rectify the flaw.

> "If you see something that is a social risk, good heavens, this thing would kill thousands, you must do something, you must do something." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>

His willingness to confront the mistake, mobilize a confidential repair plan, and work with authorities to protect the public, earned him praise from the engineering field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. The Citicorp case is now a standard component in [[Engineering ethics and crisis management | engineering ethics]] courses worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

## New Building Code Requirements

Prior to the Citicorp incident, standard structural analysis often focused on wind forces applied perpendicularly to building faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. However, LeMessurier's re-evaluation revealed that "quartering winds" – winds hitting a corner of the building – could induce significantly higher stresses (up to 60% more under dynamic conditions) on the chevron bracing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This oversight, combined with a change from welded to bolted connections, created the critical vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

As a direct consequence of the Citicorp experience, New York City updated its building code to mandate calculations for quartering wind loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

## Wider Adoption of Tuned Mass Dampers

The [[citicorp_center_structural_flaw | Citicorp Center]] was pioneering in its use of a tuned mass damper (TMD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Originally intended to reduce sway for occupant comfort in the lightweight building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, the TMD became a critical safety component during the repair phase, acting as a "crutch" for the tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. Emergency generators were acquired to ensure its continuous operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

After Citicorp, the use of TMDs became widespread globally, enabling the construction of taller and slimmer skyscrapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. The technology, which was once primarily used in bridges, power lines, and ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, is now integrated into many of the world's tallest buildings, particularly in regions prone to typhoons or earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. For example, Taipei 101 utilizes a 660-ton pendulum TMD to stabilize against high winds and earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

## Industry Reluctance and Continued Scrutiny

Despite its positive impact on engineering standards and ethics, the [[citicorp_center_structural_flaw | Citicorp Center]] incident remains a sensitive topic within the engineering community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. LeMessurier Associates, the firm founded by Bill LeMessurier, does not mention the repairs in its project description for the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. Current owners of the building (renamed 601 Lexington) also declined to comment or allow filming inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

In 2021, the National Institute of Standards and Technology conducted a new study to re-examine the impact of quartering winds on buildings like Citicorp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. While their analysis concluded that perpendicular winds exerted greater pressure, it did not include Citicorp's specific internal structural elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. This ongoing analysis highlights the continued importance and lessons learned from the [[citicorp_center_structural_flaw | Citicorp Center]] saga.

An experiment conducted at the University of Sydney's mechanical engineering shop demonstrated the counter-intuitive effects of gyroscopic precession on the perceived weight and manipulability of a spinning object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The apparatus used was a 40-pound (19 kg) flywheel attached to the end of a meter-long shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Gyroscopic Precession and Perceived Weightlessness

Without the flywheel spinning, it is virtually impossible to hold the shaft horizontally with one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, and even difficult to lift over one's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. However, when the flywheel is spun up to a few thousand RPM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:

*   **Holding horizontally:** The shaft can be held horizontally with one hand, and the wheel appears almost weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This phenomenon is explained by [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | gyroscopic precession]]: instead of pulling the wheel down as expected, its weight creates a torque that pushes it around in a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Lifting overhead:** Despite its significant mass, the spinning flywheel feels "incredibly light" when lifted overhead with one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. It felt as if the apparatus was "wanting to go up by itself," requiring less force than expected for such a weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## Actual Weight vs. Perceived Weight

To investigate whether the object's actual weight changed, an experiment was conducted using a scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>:

*   The experimenter's initial weight was approximately 72 kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   When holding the unspinning 19 kg (42 pounds) flywheel, the scale read about 91 kg, which is consistent with the combined mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

The question then arises: what would the scale reading be when the flywheel is spinning and being lifted overhead? While the object feels lighter, its actual mass does not change. This indicates that the apparent "weightlessness" is a perceptual effect due to the [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | gyroscopic effect]] redistributing the forces, not a reduction in the object's gravitational mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

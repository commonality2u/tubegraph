This article explores a psychological experiment demonstrating core principles from Nassim Taleb's *The Black Swan*, focusing on human tendencies in hypothesis testing.

## The "2, 4, 8" Number Sequence Game

The experiment begins with a three-number sequence: 2, 4, 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19"></a>. Participants are asked to determine the underlying rule that these numbers obey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05"></a>. They can propose their own sets of three numbers, to which the facilitator will respond "yes" (it follows the rule) or "no" (it doesn't follow the rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09"></a>. After gathering information, participants can propose what they believe the rule is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14"></a>.

### Common Approach: Confirmation Bias

Initially, participants often propose sequences that fit a simple pattern, such as "multiply by 2" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47"></a>. Examples given by participants included:
*   16, 32, 64 (follows the rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32"></a>
*   3, 6, 12 (follows the rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58"></a>
*   10, 20, 40 (follows the rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00"></a>
*   5, 10, 20 (follows the rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10"></a>
*   100, 200, 400 (follows the rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13"></a>
*   500, 1000, 2000 (follows the rule) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18"></a>

Despite these all fitting the "multiply by 2" pattern, this was **not** the underlying rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50"></a>. The common mistake was that participants sought to confirm their existing hypothesis rather than strategically testing its boundaries or attempting to disprove it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39"></a>. They were always asking questions where they expected a "yes" answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53"></a>.

### Strategic Approach: Seeking Disconfirmation

To effectively figure out the rule, participants needed to propose numbers that they thought *wouldn't* fit their imagined rule, or *wouldn't* follow the facilitator's rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41"></a>. The "no" answers are considered much more informational than "yes" answers in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00"></a>.

Eventually, by proposing sequences that broke the "multiply by 2" pattern, like "10, 9, 8" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49"></a>, which did **not** follow the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51"></a>, participants deduced the actual rule.

### The Actual Rule

The simple rule was that the numbers had to be in **increasing (ascending) order** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53"></a>. Any numbers in ascending order would follow the rule, such as 1, 2, 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24"></a> or 7, 8, 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27"></a>, or even 2, 4, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47"></a>.

## Inspiration from The Black Swan

The experiment was inspired by the book *The Black Swan* by Nassim Taleb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14"></a>.

### The Black Swan Metaphor

The "black swan" is a metaphor for the unknown and the unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18"></a>. Historically, the theory was that all swans were white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22"></a>. Every sighting of a white swan seemed to confirm this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25"></a>. However, one can never truly *prove* a theory true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29"></a>. The discovery of black swans in Australia disproved the long-held belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33"></a>.

### Application to the Scientific Method

The experiment highlights a crucial aspect of the scientific method: the goal is to **disprove** theories, not merely confirm them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06"></a>. When a theory cannot be disproven despite rigorous attempts, it suggests a deeper truth about reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12"></a>. This principle encourages individuals to actively try to disprove their own beliefs in all aspects of life to truly arrive at the truth and avoid self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18"></a>.

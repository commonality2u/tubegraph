The Navy's Indoor Ocean at Carderock, the largest [[wave_pool_technology_and_design | wave pool]] in the world, serves as a test facility for ships before they go out on the open ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This massive pool is 360 feet long in one dimension, 240 feet long in another, and 20 feet deep, roughly the size of a football field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The dome covering it was once the largest freestanding dome globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Fundamental Wave Characteristics

This facility utilizes 216 individual wave makers, which are huge paddles lining two walls of the pool, to produce waves of various shapes and sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. These paddles can create waves from -45 degrees up to 135 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. What makes this [[wave_pool_technology_and_design | wave pool]] unique is its precise control, allowing for the repeated generation of waves with specific amplitudes and frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

A fundamental characteristic of a wave is its wavelength, defined as the distance from one crest to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Waves primarily transmit energy rather than material from one place to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. In water waves, as the wave travels, water molecules typically move along circular paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This motion diminishes with depth, stopping entirely at a depth equal to half the wavelength, a point known as the wave base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Even in ideal water waves, molecules drift slightly in the direction of wave motion because they travel faster at the top of their loop than they move backward at the bottom, resulting in a spiral path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

The frequency of a wave significantly affects its speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. High-frequency waves travel slower than low-frequency waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. If the water is deeper than the wave base, wave speed is inversely proportional to its frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Wave Phenomena and Interactions

### Superposition

A key principle of [[wave_particle_duality | waves]] is superposition, where waves add together when they meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The water's height at a given point is the sum of the heights of the individual waves meeting there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This principle allows for the creation of:

*   **Breaking Waves:** By sending out high-frequency waves followed by lower and lower frequency waves, the slower high-frequency waves are gradually caught up by the faster low-frequency waves. When all the waves converge at the same time and place, their amplitudes add up, causing a large breaking wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Standing Waves:** When two regular waves travel towards each other, they interact to form standing waves. At certain points in the pool, the waves consistently cancel out to zero amplitude, while at others, they combine for maximum amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Bullseye Waves:** By sending waves from all directions, they can form circular wave fronts that channel all their energy into a single spot, creating a breaking wave at that "bullseye" point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This break occurs when the wave height becomes more than one-seventh of its wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Rogue Waves

Rogue waves, often perceived as appearing out of nowhere, are typically caused by multiple waves meeting and creating an amplitude much larger than what a single wave would produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. When this large amplitude is reached, the wave cannot sustain itself and breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## Ocean Wave Generation

Most ocean waves are generated by wind, with the strongest waves occurring in and around storms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Five factors influence the size and shape of these waves:
1.  Wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>
2.  Wind duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>
3.  The distance over which the wind acts (known as the fetch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>
4.  The width of the fetch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>
5.  The depth of the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>

[[mechanics_of_wind_and_velocity | Wind waves]] form in three steps:
1.  As wind blows across still water, turbulent air motion creates slight pressure differences, forming tiny ripples (wavelengths around a centimeter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
2.  The wind then acts on these ripples, creating larger pressure differences between the front and top of the wave crest, pulling them into bigger waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
3.  This interaction between wind and waves leads to even larger pressure differences and waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

Waves become mostly uniform, but as they interact, they develop a range of different wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. As the wind continues to blow, these waves begin to break, transferring their kinetic energy into swirling eddies that dissipate energy as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. A "fully developed sea" is reached when the energy dissipation matches the energy input from the wind, signifying the waves have achieved their maximum size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Swell vs. Wind Waves

As waves travel away from a storm, higher frequency waves dissipate their energy more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Therefore, the waves that travel long distances are the fast-moving, low-frequency waves known as swell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Swell, characterized by its long wavelength, is generally not a concern for ships in the open ocean, as it mostly causes a ship to heave slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Ships are more affected by steep, windy waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Ship Testing and Ocean Spectra

The primary purpose of the Indoor Ocean is to replicate real-world wave conditions on a small scale to test Navy ship designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Ship models, scaled down significantly (e.g., 46 times smaller), are tested to observe their behavior in simulated ocean conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

To ensure accurate data for [[fluid_mechanics | fluid mechanics]], the scaling process must account for factors like water salinity (freshwater in the pool versus saltwater in the ocean affects buoyancy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Crucially, while [[fluid_mechanics | fluid mechanics]] often uses the Reynolds number for scaling, accurate wave dynamics require scaling based on the Froude number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The Froude number represents the ratio of inertial to gravitational forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. For a ship model 46 times smaller than the real vessel, it must travel at a speed of 1 over the square root of 46 times its real-world speed to yield accurate data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

The facility can generate "irregular waves," which are combinations of multiple frequencies and amplitudes, unlike the single-frequency, single-amplitude regular waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Different oceans around the world have distinct mixtures of wave frequencies, or "spectra," influenced by their geography and storm types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>:
*   The North Sea and other small bodies of water have a "peakier" spectrum due to limited fetch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   The mid-Atlantic exhibits a broader spectrum, representative of developing or decaying open ocean waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   The North Atlantic, with steady winds over an open ocean, produces the broadest spectrum of [[mechanics_of_wind_and_velocity | wind waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

Engineers must identify the appropriate spectrum for a ship's deployment location and replicate it in the pool for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Sensors, such as ultrasonic sensors, are used to measure wave height, period, and direction within the basin, ensuring the tested conditions match the intended simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

Innovation in ship design continues, with model testing significantly cutting costs compared to building and then modifying full-scale vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Every ship in the Navy's fleet has undergone testing or peripheral evaluation in this facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Hull designs like the "tumble home," which shape inward, are explored for various reasons, including reducing above-water signatures and improving radar sections for stealth, speed, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

The question of whether a penny dropped from a great height, like the Empire State Building, could be lethal has long been a popular urban myth [00:00:03]. This myth highlights a common misunderstanding about falling objects and the [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | effect of air resistance]].

The Empire State Building, reaching 443 meters to its very top, would theoretically allow a penny to accelerate to over 300 kilometers per hour if [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] were ignored [00:00:50]. However, this theoretical speed is not reached in reality [00:04:26].

## The Role of Air Resistance and Terminal Velocity

The fundamental concept governing the speed of falling objects in an atmosphere is [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] [00:04:26]. This is demonstrated by the classic experiment of dropping a hammer and a feather:
*   **On the Moon**: In the near vacuum of the Moon's surface, both a hammer and a feather accelerate at the same rate due to gravity and hit the ground simultaneously [00:04:39].
*   **On Earth**: On Earth, the hammer lands significantly before the feather [00:04:55]. The feather quickly reaches a constant speed, known as its **terminal velocity** [00:05:05].

Terminal velocity is achieved when the downward force of gravity on an object is perfectly balanced by the upward [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | force of air resistance]] [00:05:10]. [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | Air resistance]] is proportional to the square of the object's speed [00:05:33]. The [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | effect of air resistance]] on an object's fall depends on the ratio of its weight to the [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] it experiences [00:05:55].

Every object has its own unique terminal velocity, representing the maximum speed it will reach when falling through still air [00:06:01].

## Factors Influencing Terminal Velocity

### Weight and Shape
*   **Weight**: For objects of the same size and [[impact_of_object_shape_on_drag_and_terminal_velocity | shape]], a heavier object will have a higher terminal velocity [00:06:28]. For example, two identical balls, one filled with water, will float at different wind speeds in a wind tunnel [00:06:32].
*   **Cross-sectional Area and Shape**: The [[impact_of_object_shape_on_drag_and_terminal_velocity | air resistance]] an object experiences is proportional to its cross-sectional area and is also influenced by its overall [[impact_of_object_shape_on_drag_and_terminal_velocity | shape]] [00:15:40]. Some objects with very different sizes and [[impact_of_object_shape_on_drag_and_terminal_velocity | shapes]], like a person and a lacrosse ball, can have the same terminal velocity if their weight-to-[[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] ratio is similar [00:06:44].

### Air Density
[[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | Air resistance]] is directly proportional to the density of the air an object moves through [00:07:45].
*   **High Altitude**: At higher altitudes, where air is less dense, terminal velocity increases significantly [00:07:12]. Felix Baumgartner's 2012 jump from 39 kilometers above sea level saw him reach a terminal velocity of over 1300 km/h, breaking the sound barrier, due to the air being 60 times less dense than at sea level [00:07:21]. As he fell into thicker atmosphere, his terminal velocity decreased [00:07:54].

### Drag Coefficient
The [[impact_of_object_shape_on_drag_and_terminal_velocity | shape]]-dependent [[effect of air resistance on falling objects | air resistance]] is captured by the **Drag Coefficient**, a dimensionless number [00:15:46]. This coefficient reflects how smoothly air flows around an object without creating vortices [00:15:51].
*   Early bullets were spherical ("boulettes") with a drag coefficient of 0.5 [00:16:00]. Modern bullets are shaped to reduce drag, having a drag coefficient between 0.1 and 0.3 [00:16:16].

## Terminal Velocities and Lethality of Specific Objects

### Pennies
*   A penny weighs approximately 2.5 grams, about half to a quarter the weight of a bullet [00:00:39].
*   Pennies reach their terminal velocity after falling only about 15 meters [00:10:15].
*   Their terminal velocity is at most around 80 kilometers per hour [00:13:05].
*   A penny's [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] at terminal velocity is about 0.2 Joules, far below the 68 Joules needed to fracture a human skull [00:20:21].
*   The myth of a deadly falling penny is "busted" [00:13:11].
*   **Fluttering Behavior**: Pennies do not have a single terminal velocity due to their fluttering and tumbling as they fall. They oscillate between two terminal velocities: one on their face and one on their edge [00:11:13]. This [[difficulties_in_aiming_and_targeting_kinetic_projectiles | makes them hard to aim]] [00:11:07].

### Ballpoint Pens
*   Plastic ballpoint pens weigh about twice as much as a penny and have a smaller cross-sectional area [00:13:44].
*   Despite this, they still have too much drag relative to their weight to achieve a high terminal velocity, and are generally not lethal when dropped from height [00:15:31]. The myth about them being dangerous is also "busted" [00:15:20].

### Raindrops
*   Raindrops have a low terminal velocity of just 25 kilometers per hour [00:08:42].
*   They are typically 0.5 to 4 millimeters in diameter [00:08:26].
*   Raindrops are not shaped like traditional cartoon raindrops; they are closer to spherical, but flatter on the bottom where they encounter oncoming air [00:08:51]. Large raindrops can flatten, briefly resemble a parachute, and then break into smaller droplets [00:09:02].
*   A raindrop delivers only 0.002 Joules of [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] at terminal velocity [00:20:17].

### Hailstones
*   Hail can reach terminal velocities exceeding 200 kilometers per hour, which is about 10 times that of rain [00:09:31].
*   The primary reason for hail's higher terminal velocity is its size; hailstones have been measured up to 20 centimeters in diameter [00:09:46].
*   Drag scales with the radius squared, while weight scales with the radius cubed [00:09:54]. Thus, larger hailstones achieve faster terminal velocities, carry more [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]], and deliver a greater impact [00:10:03].
*   A baseball or the largest measured hailstone can deliver over 80 Joules of [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]], which is enough to crack a skull [00:20:24]. Hail causes injuries and even fatalities annually [00:09:22].

### Bullets
*   **Dropped Bullet**: A bullet dropped from a skyscraper will tumble and likely fall on its side, experiencing far more [[effect of air resistance on falling objects | air resistance]] [00:16:35]. This tumbling behavior means it will not speed up significantly and will be much slower than a fired bullet upon impact [00:17:21].
*   **Fired Bullet**: If a bullet is fired straight up, it slows down, stops at its apex (up to 3 km high), and then falls back down, tumbling as it does [00:17:02]. However, if a bullet is fired at an angle, it maintains horizontal velocity and spin from the gun barrel grooves, keeping it pointy-end forward [00:17:39]. This allows it to speed up to a significant fraction of its launch speed as it returns to the ground, posing a much greater danger [00:17:58]. Celebratory gunfire has led to hundreds of deaths globally [00:18:06].

### Flechettes
*   Used in World War I, flechettes were small pieces of metal, resembling nails with feathers, dropped from planes [00:18:22]. Some were up to 15 centimeters long [00:18:32].
*   They were cheap to produce and deploy, did not require explosives, and could pierce helmets, causing nasty injuries [00:18:49]. Cases exist of flechettes passing through a rider and their horse [00:18:59].
*   The [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | energy]] stored in a falling flechette is not enough to fracture a skull by blunt force trauma, but their ability to apply a large force to a very small area makes them dangerous [00:20:40].
*   Similar weapons, called Lazy Dogs, were used by the US in the Korean and Vietnam wars [00:19:16].

### Other Dangerous Falling Objects
Many other objects pose a lethal threat when falling:
*   Nearly 700 Americans die each year from being struck by falling objects [00:19:40].
*   These include loose tiles, bricks, construction tools, rocks, tree branches, and even icicles [00:19:44].
*   In 2014, a man was killed by a measuring tape falling 50 stories [00:20:31].

## Lethal Threshold
The lower limit of [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | energy]] required to fracture a human skull is approximately 68 Joules [00:20:07]. Any object delivering [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] greater than this threshold is very likely to be lethal [00:20:12].

In summary, objects weighing a few grams that are not aerodynamic, like pennies or plastic pens, are generally not fatal due to their low terminal velocity [00:20:53]. However, objects weighing more than a few hundred grams, or those with highly aerodynamic [[impact_of_object_shape_on_drag_and_terminal_velocity | shapes]], can reach sufficient terminal velocities and [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] to be deadly [00:20:58].

The Antikythera Mechanism is an ancient Greek artifact discovered in 1901 within a shipwreck off the island of Antikythera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This sophisticated device, constructed around 100 or 200 BC, is considered an early computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Its complexity would not be matched for at least another thousand years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Features and Functionality
Through 3D x-ray scans, it has been revealed that the Antikythera Mechanism contains 37 interlocking bronze gears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These gears enabled it to:
*   Model the motions of the sun and moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   Predict eclipses decades in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Analog Computing
Unlike [[differences_between_analog_and_digital_computers | modern digital computers]], the Antikythera Mechanism operates by analogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It is an [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The arrangement of its gears allowed the motions of specific dials to be analogous to the actual movements of the sun and moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For millennia, humans utilized [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog devices]] such as the Antikythera Mechanism and slide rules alongside digital devices like abacuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Platonic solids are a special class of geometric objects defined by specific properties: all of their faces are identical, and all of their vertices are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This means that a Platonic solid can be rotated through a certain angle and appear the same as it did before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Types of Platonic Solids

There are only five Platonic solids:
*   **Cube** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   **Tetrahedron** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   **Octahedron** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Dodecahedron**: This solid has 12 pentagonal sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Icosahedron**: This solid has 20 sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The fact that there are only five Platonic solids was a convenient discovery for early scientists and mathematicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Johannes Kepler and Platonic Solids

The story of Platonic solids in science extends back over 400 years to Prague and the work of Johannes Kepler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Kepler, famous for determining that planetary orbits are ellipses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, initially developed a model of the solar system using Platonic solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

In his model, the planets were situated on nested spheres, with the Platonic solids acting as "spacers" between these spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. At the time, only six planets were known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, which allowed Kepler to place a unique Platonic solid between each of the planetary spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. He carefully selected the order of these solids to ensure that the distances between the planets matched astronomical observations as closely as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This approach was driven by Kepler's deep belief in a geometric regularity underlying the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Modern Relevance: Quasi-Crystals

The five-fold symmetry inherent in some Platonic solids, particularly the icosahedron, played a significant role in a later scientific discovery. In the early 1980s, Paul Steinhardt and his students used computers to model how atoms form condensed matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. They found that atoms locally tended to form icosahedrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. This finding was initially considered problematic because the icosahedron, with its strong five-fold symmetries, was known as the "most forbidden shape" in traditional crystallography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

Inspired by Penrose tilings, Steinhardt designed a new type of structure – a 3D analog of Penrose tilings – which became known as a [[quasi_crystals | quasi-crystal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Simulations showed that these structures would produce diffraction patterns with rings of 10 points, reflecting their underlying five-fold symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

Around the same time, unaware of Steinhardt's theoretical work, Dan Shechtman created a flaky material from aluminum and manganese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. When he scattered electrons off this material, the diffraction pattern he observed almost perfectly matched Steinhardt's predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

The discovery of [[quasi_crystals | quasi-crystals]] challenged previous assumptions in crystallography, which held that crystals must be made of repeating units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Although initially met with skepticism from some scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, Shechtman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011 for his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. [[quasi_crystals | Quasi-crystals]] have since been grown with beautiful dodecahedral shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a> and are being explored for applications such as non-stick electrical insulation, cookware, and ultra-durable steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

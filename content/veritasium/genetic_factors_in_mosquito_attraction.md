From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Certain individuals are more attractive to mosquitoes than others, a phenomenon science has confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This difference is, at least partially, genetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. [[the_role_of_dna_in_determining_attractiveness_to_mosquitoes | Research has identified specific spots on DNA]] that influence an individual's likelihood of being attractive to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Mosquito Biology and Behavior

Mosquitoes require blood proteins to produce eggs, meaning only female mosquitoes bite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The mosquito lifecycle, from egg to adult, takes only two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. After hatching into wriggly larvae, they develop into pupae before becoming flying, adult mosquitoes that seek vertebrate blood for more eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Professor Immo Hansen at New Mexico State University maintains colonies of various mosquito species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Notably, he feeds one exotic strain with his own blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. He regularly receives about 25 bites during these feeding sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This particular strain, *Aedes aegypti*, almost exclusively feeds on humans, being highly specialized in biting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## The Y-Tube Test for Attraction

[[research_on_mosquito_preferences | The Y-tube test]] is used to evaluate mosquito attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. In this setup, mosquitoes are placed in a holding chamber at the base of a Y-shaped tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. A fan creates a draft, and a "bait"—such as a human hand—is inserted into one arm of the Y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Rubbing the hand to get sweat and oils is recommended to maximize attractant chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Mosquitoes then choose which arm to fly down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Initial Test
When tested, one individual (Derek) proved to be a "strong attractant" for mosquitoes, with all 20 mosquitoes in the chamber flying towards his hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Genetic Basis: Twin Studies
The Y-tube test was instrumental in discovering the genetic basis for mosquito attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. [[research_on_mosquito_preferences | Researchers]] recruited 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of fraternal (non-identical) female twins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. By evaluating each twin's mosquito attractiveness, scientists found a correlation: if one twin was attractive, the other likely was too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Crucially, this correlation was higher for identical twins, who share more genes, strongly suggesting that genetics influence mosquito attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Comparing Individuals
When comparing two individuals (Derek and his wife Raquel), Derek, who anecdotally gets bitten more, attracted more mosquitoes in a Y-tube test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. While not scientifically rigorous due to a single trial, it reproduced their real-world experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## DNA and Attraction
A 2017 study, involving 23andMe and 16,000 participants who opted into research and rated their perceived mosquito attractiveness, conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This study looked for commonalities in the DNA of those who reported high attractiveness compared to those who reported low attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. They identified seven specific single-letter changes (SNPs) in DNA associated with different levels of mosquito attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

In a personal comparison between Derek and Raquel based on these seven locations:
*   They had identical DNA at four locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   At one differing location, Raquel had a letter change associated with *decreased* attractiveness (protection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   At another differing location, Derek had a letter change associated with *decreased* attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, though Raquel's protective variant was twice as significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   At the last differing SNP, Derek had two copies of a variant associated with *increased* attractiveness to mosquitoes, while Raquel had none <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

Overall, their genetic results were consistent with their anecdotal experience of Derek being more attractive to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Mechanisms of Attraction
The exact mechanism by which these genetic changes influence attraction is unclear, but it likely relates to body odor, volatile chemicals given off by the body, or the skin's microbiome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

Key attractants for mosquitoes include:
*   **Carbon dioxide**: Higher metabolism, recent exercise, larger body size, or pregnancy can lead to increased CO2 output, making individuals more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Volatiles**: Lactic acid, acetone, and ammonia are also attractive to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

Conversely, some naturally occurring chemicals, like octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, appear to repel mosquitoes or hinder their ability to find humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Significance and Evolutionary Aspects

Mosquito attractiveness is estimated to be as hereditary as height or [[factors_influencing_iq_scores | IQ]], indicating a significant genetic role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Understanding this relationship is crucial because mosquitoes have the greatest [[impact_of_mosquitoes_on_human_health | impact on human health]] of all animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. They are considered the most dangerous animal globally, with malaria alone having killed more people than humans have killed humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. While the estimate that mosquitoes have killed over half of all humans who ever lived is debated and likely too high, over a million people die annually from mosquito-borne illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

An intriguing [[evolutionary_aspects_of_human_interaction_with_mosquitoes | evolutionary aspect]] is that if a person contracts malaria, the parasite changes the host's body chemistry to make them produce an odor that increases their attractiveness to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This adaptation facilitates the transmission of malaria by the mosquitoes, demonstrating the incredible power of evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

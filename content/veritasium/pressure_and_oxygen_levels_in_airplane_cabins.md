Airplane cabins are meticulously engineered to maintain a breathable and safe environment for passengers at high altitudes. This involves managing both air pressure and oxygen levels within the cabin.

## Why Planes Fly So High
Planes typically cruise at altitudes around 30,000 to 43,000 feet, or about 10 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:01:42]</a>.
Reasons for flying at these altitudes include:
*   **Smoother Ride**: Flying high in the troposphere, where most weather occurs, results in less turbulence and fewer storms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Cost Efficiency**: This is the primary reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. At 33,000 feet (10 km), air density is only one-third of what it is at sea level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This reduced air resistance allows planes to fly about 73% faster for the same thrust, reaching destinations quicker and burning less fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. [[altitude_and_fuel_efficiency_in_aviation | Jet engines]] are also more efficient in the colder air at altitude, where temperatures can be around minus 50 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Jet Stream Advantage**: Planes can utilize jet stream tailwinds at high altitudes, further reducing fuel consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## The Challenge: Unbreathable Air
Despite the benefits of high-altitude flight, the air at these elevations is unbreathable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Low Pressure**: Air pressure significantly drops with altitude because it depends on the weight of the air above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. At 10 km, the air pressure is only a quarter of that at sea level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Insufficient Oxygen Partial Pressure**: While the air still contains 21% oxygen, the *partial pressure* of oxygen—the pressure exerted by oxygen molecules alone—is too low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. At 10 km, it's around 5.5 kilopascals, compared to 22 kilopascals on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Humans need at least 16 kilopascals of oxygen partial pressure to function normally, or they would remain conscious for only about three minutes, as if on Mount Everest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Cabin Pressurization: The Solution
To overcome the challenges of high altitude, airplane cabins must be pressurized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Air Source**: A continuous flow of air is brought into the cabin from the compression stage of the jet engines, which maintains breathable air inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This process, however, slightly reduces engine efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Cabin Pressure**: Airplane cabins are typically pressurized to approximately 77 kilopascals at cruising altitude, ensuring an oxygen partial pressure of around 16 kilopascals—the minimum required for passengers to feel normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This is less than sea level pressure (101.3 kilopascals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Aircraft Design for Pressurization
The requirement for pressurization led to a significant redesign of aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Plug-shaped Doors**: Before pressurization, plane doors opened outward, as pressure was the same on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. With pressurization, all doors were changed to a plug shape, wider on the inside than the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This design means the higher internal cabin pressure pushes the door into its frame, creating an airtight seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Door Security**: This pressure difference is why airplane doors and emergency exits don't need locks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The force required to pull a door inwards against this pressure differential at altitude is equivalent to lifting 9,000 kilograms, making it impossible for a person to open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Even modern outward-opening doors are designed with an initial inward movement that prevents them from opening at altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
    *   **Exception**: In May 2023, a passenger managed to open an emergency exit on final approach when the plane was close to the ground, and the pressure differential was minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## Effects of Cabin Pressure
The lower-than-sea-level pressure inside airplane cabins has several noticeable effects:
*   **Chip Bags**: A bag of chips taken on a plane will inflate like a balloon as the cabin pressure drops at cruising altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Human Body**: The expansion of gases due to lower pressure can cause physiological changes, such as increased flatulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Taste and Smell**: The dry air (as low as 5% relative humidity, compared to 25% in the Sahara Desert) can dry out nasal passages, hindering the sense of smell and, consequently, taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Lower cabin pressure can also decrease the intensity of salt and sugar sensations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. [[effects_of_cabin_pressure_on_taste_and_airplane_food | Airplane food]] often tastes different as a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Notably, the flavor of umami (savory) in foods like tomatoes appears to be enhanced in flight, possibly due to loud cabin noise stimulating a nerve connected to the eardrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Why Minimum Pressurization?
While the International Space Station is pressurized to full sea level pressure (101.3 kilopascals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, planes are pressurized only to the minimum extent necessary for human comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Fatigue Cycles**: Unlike the ISS, planes undergo repeated pressurization and depressurization cycles with every flight, causing the fuselage to stretch and relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Aloha Airlines Flight 243 (1988)**: This incident highlighted the dangers of fuselage fatigue. The plane, with nearly 90,000 flight cycles (far more than designed), experienced an explosive decompression at 24,000 feet when a crack widened and the roof tore off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Extended Aircraft Life**: Pressurizing cabins to the least extent possible minimizes these stresses, extending the life of the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

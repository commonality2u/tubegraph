Upon entering a Zero-G plane in France, the narrator describes their initial reaction to [[experiencing_weightlessness_for_the_first_time | experiencing weightlessness for the first time]] as "so strange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> and "totally freaky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The experience was "way better than I expected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The flight was undertaken with fellow YouTubers Bruce and Diana, the Physics Girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## How Weightlessness is Achieved

The fundamental principle behind weightlessness is relatively simple: the plane and everything inside it must accelerate towards Earth at the same rate as a freely falling object in a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This acceleration rate is 9.8 meters per second squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This can be visualized by imagining a pen inside a bottle: if both are freely falling, there is no contact force between them, making the pen feel weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## The Parabolic Trajectory

Achieving weightlessness is not done by simply putting the plane into a dive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Instead, the process involves a specific flight pattern:
1.  **Hyper-G Climb:** The plane begins to climb at a steadily increasing angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Inside, without windows, passengers feel pressed into the floor with a force 1.8 times their body weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This "hyper-G" effect occurs because the plane's acceleration is directed upwards, perpendicular to the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   This makes standing difficult and causes blood to drain from the head to the feet, leading to dizziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
    *   Lying on one's back is more comfortable, and passengers are advised not to move their heads to avoid motion sickness, a common issue earning this flight profile the nickname "vomit comet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:02:02]</a>.
2.  **Engine Ramp Down and Parabolic Arc:** Once the plane is climbing at approximately 50 degrees, the engines are throttled down, and the plane enters a parabolic trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This is the point where weightlessness begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Although the plane and passengers are still moving upwards initially, they are accelerating downward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
3.  **Peak and Descent:** The plane peaks and then speeds up again towards Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Throughout this phase, the plane accelerates toward Earth at the same rate as a free-falling object in a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Pilots must skillfully adjust thrust to precisely balance air resistance and maintain this exact acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
4.  **Return to Hyper-G:** After about 22 seconds of weightlessness, the pilots pull out of the dive, subjecting passengers to hyper-G conditions once more as the plane accelerates upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

In total, the flight performed thirteen zero-G parabolas, in addition to one Martian gravity and two Moon gravity parabolas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. In Mars gravity, the narrator could perform one-arm pull-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## [[conducting_experiments_in_zero_gravity | Experiments in Zero-G]]

Several [[conducting_experiments_in_zero_gravity | experiments]] were conducted during the zero-G flight:

### [[effects_of_zero_gravity_on_fire_and_flames | Flame Behavior in Varying Gravities]]
Flames typically have a distinctive shape due to gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Normal Gravity (1G):** Combustion products are hotter, move faster, and take up more space than cooler surrounding air. This creates a buoyant force greater than their weight, causing hot air to rise and pulling oxygen to sustain the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Hyper-G:** The effect of gravity is magnified, almost doubling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This amplifies the weight difference between hot and cool air, causing hot air to rise faster and creating a longer flame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Zero-G:** With much less buoyant force, combustion is not as efficient, leading to significant smoke production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. While hot air is still less dense, without weight or buoyant force, the flame does not rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The flame maintains some shape due to the fuel flow from the lighter; otherwise, it would form a sphere, as seen on the space station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. It's difficult to maintain combustion in zero-G because it's hard for oxygen to reach the fuel due to combustion products getting in the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Observing a flame can be a good way to determine the gravitational acceleration of an environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### [[applying_physics_in_educational_demonstrations | Slinky Experiment]]
A [[applying_physics_in_educational_demonstrations | slinky]] experiment, similar to a slow-motion drop but in zero-G, was performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Since the slinky couldn't dangle under its own weight, it was swung around the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The expectation was to see what happens to the end of the slinky when let go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

*   **Result:** The slinky remained fairly stretched out and continued rotating at about the same frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Physics Explanation:** This result, initially perceived as boring, revealed that weight was never part of the equation for the slinky's stretched state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The slinky stretched because it was rotating, and since it continued to rotate after being let go, roughly the same tension was required to maintain that circular motion, preventing it from contracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. In zero-G, a stretched slinky can rotate in place without contracting as long as the tension provides the centripetal force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Challenging Intuition
The slinky experiment in particular defied the narrator's [[effects_of_zero_gravity_on_human_perception_and_intuition | intuition]], which is primarily based on experiences with gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The narrator states that being weightless was an unforgettable experience, but perhaps the most valuable aspect was how it [[effects_of_zero_gravity_on_human_perception_and_intuition | challenged their intuition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[conducting_experiments_in_zero_gravity | research in zero-G]] environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

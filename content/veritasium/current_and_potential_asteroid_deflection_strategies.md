The threat posed by asteroids has led to consideration of various deflection strategies, though current capabilities are limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. The primary challenge before any deflection can be attempted is the accurate detection and prediction of asteroid trajectories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## The Challenge of Detection and Prediction

Detecting asteroids before they impact Earth is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Since 1988, over 1200 asteroids larger than a meter have collided with Earth, but only five were detected beforehand, none with more than a day's warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Difficulties in detection include:
*   **Size and Visibility** Asteroids range from meters to kilometers in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. They are often rough and dark, reflecting only about 15% of incident light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Opposition Effect** Most near-Earth asteroids are detected when fully illuminated by the sun, typically in the 45 degrees of sky directly opposite the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This "opposition effect" means asteroids approaching from the direction of the sun are often unseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The [[chelyabinsk_asteroid_event | Chelyabinsk asteroid]] was one such example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Orbital Prediction Limits** Even with good observations, gravitational pulls from planets on near-Earth asteroids can significantly change their orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This "dynamical chaos" limits accurate predictions to about 100 years into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

Currently, approximately one million asteroids have been cataloged, with 24,000 identified as [[Nearearth objects and their detection difficulties | near-Earth objects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It is estimated that 98% of one-to-two-kilometer sized bodies have been identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. However, many hundred-meter sized projectiles, capable of obliterating a large city, remain undetected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## Proposed Deflection Methods

Despite ongoing discussions and committee reviews, there is currently no proven method to deflect a kilometer-sized asteroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

Proposed ideas for deflection, and their challenges, include:

*   **Bombing**
    *   **Concept:** Using explosives to break up an asteroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
    *   **Challenges:** It's unclear how effective this would be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. An asteroid, especially a "rubble pile" type, might simply re-form under gravity after being fragmented, or if it was already a rubble pile, the outcome of exploding it is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

*   **Attaching Rockets or Nudging**
    *   **Concept:** Attaching a rocket to an asteroid to gently push it off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
    *   **Challenges:** Current rockets are not powerful enough to significantly alter an asteroid's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Furthermore, rockets would need to remain attached to the rotating asteroid for centuries to have a substantial effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

*   **Laser Ablation**
    *   **Concept:** Using powerful lasers to boil off material from the asteroid's surface, creating a small thrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
    *   **Challenges:** Lasers powerful enough to achieve this from Earth do not exist, and taking the lasers to the object is even more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

*   **Wrapping with Foil**
    *   **Concept:** Wrapping an asteroid in aluminum foil to change its radiative properties, thereby altering its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
    *   **Challenges:** The logistics of launching enough foil and wrapping an asteroid are currently impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

For a 10-kilometer asteroid, any deflection attempt is "a thousand times more hopeless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

## Evacuation as a Last Resort

Given the current lack of effective deflection methods, evacuation of the target zone is considered, though highly problematic:
*   **Concept:** If the impact location could be predicted, evacuating a city or region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.
*   **Challenges:** Past large-scale evacuations for events like hurricanes have shown that they are extremely difficult due to traffic bottlenecks on freeways, leading to instant gridlock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

## Future Approach

The most reasonable current strategy is to focus on detection and surveying of asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This involves building more telescopes, including space-based ones, to improve the understanding of the asteroid threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Once a particularly dangerous object is identified, then more serious efforts can be made to develop and implement deflection methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

### Impact Scale
Even small asteroids can cause significant damage due to [[Kinetic energy and its effects on impact | kinetic energy]]:
*   **20-meter asteroid:** The Chelyabinsk meteor, roughly the width of two school buses, exploded 30 kilometers above ground, injuring 1500 people and damaging thousands of buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **50-meter asteroid:** The asteroid that created Barringer Crater released the energy equivalent of 10 megatons of TNT, over 600 times the energy of the Hiroshima bomb, and vaporized on impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **1-2 kilometer asteroid:** Capable of causing massive local damage, such as obliterating a country the size of France or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **100-meter asteroid:** Could destroy a large city, causing city-wide fires and high-speed ejecta that would obliterate a 100-kilometer zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   **10-kilometer asteroid:** Like the one that wiped out dinosaurs 65 million years ago, would have a global effect, launching debris that would heat the entire sky to a "red, hot glow," effectively cooking everything on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. While such an event occurs roughly every hundred million years, no known 10-kilometer impacter is on a path to intersect Earth for the next hundred years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

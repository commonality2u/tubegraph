Within each human cell, there are six feet of DNA, composed of six billion letters of genetic code [00:00:01]. This DNA is organized into 46 distinct pieces, each measuring 3 to 4 centimeters in length, known as chromosomes [00:00:10].

## Chromosome Forms

Chromosomes are typically depicted in a condensed, X-like shape, but they only adopt this form when a cell is preparing to divide [00:00:14]. Normally, DNA exists as a "wiggly thread" within the cell's nucleus [00:00:20]. Given that DNA is only about 2 nanometers wide, while a chromosome can be several centimeters long, an intricate packing mechanism is necessary to prevent tangling [00:00:26].

## DNA Packing

To manage its length, DNA is wrapped around proteins called [[role_of_histones_in_dna_packing | histones]] [00:00:35]. These [[role_of_histones_in_dna_packing | histones]] possess "wiggly tails" that play a crucial role in regulating DNA access [00:00:41].

## Chromosome Inheritance and Sex Determination

An individual's unique set of DNA is formed when 23 chromosomes from the mother combine with 23 from the father [00:00:45]. Of these, 22 pairs of chromosomes from each parent form matching pairs, while the 23rd set consists of the sex chromosomes [00:00:52]. Two X chromosomes define a female, whereas an X and a Y chromosome define a male [00:00:58].

### [[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | X Chromosome Inactivation in Females]]

In males, both the X and Y sex chromosomes remain active throughout life [00:01:03]. However, in females, one of the two X chromosomes must be [[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | inactivated]] to ensure proper development [00:01:09]. This process occurs remarkably early, when a female embryo is merely four days old and comprises only about 100 cells [00:01:17].

At this stage, both the X chromosome inherited from the mother and the X chromosome from the father are initially active [00:01:23]. Through a "tiny molecular battle," one X chromosome prevails and remains active, while the other becomes [[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | inactivated]] [00:01:27].

The [[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | inactivation]] process involves several steps:
*   **DNA Packing** The DNA is packed more densely together [00:01:34].
*   **[[role_of_histones_in_dna_packing | Histone]] Modifications** Modifications are made to the "dangly [[role_of_histones_in_dna_packing | histone]] tails," signaling this inactivation [00:01:39].
*   **Structural Proteins** New structural proteins are added to further bind everything closer [00:01:45].
*   **Methyl Groups** Tiny molecular markers called methyl groups are added directly to the DNA, signaling to the cell that this DNA should not be read [00:01:49].

Collectively, these mechanisms make the DNA very difficult for the molecular machinery to access, effectively "switching off" or "silencing" the DNA [00:01:59]. In contrast, the active X chromosome's DNA remains more spread out, allowing better access to its genes [00:02:09]. For active genes, [[role_of_histones_in_dna_packing | histones]] can be slid along or entirely removed from the DNA [00:02:19], and their tails bear different modifications to signal active DNA [00:02:32]. This accessible state allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA), which then guides protein production in the cell [00:02:37].

### Randomness and Mosaicism

Surprisingly, the choice of which X chromosome is [[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | inactivated]] appears to be random [00:02:48]. In some cells, the father's X chromosome wins, while in others, the mother's X chromosome wins [00:02:53]. This results in the 100-cell embryo having a mixture of active X chromosomes [00:02:58]. Crucially, once a cell's X chromosome is chosen, all its subsequent daughter cells maintain that same active X chromosome [00:03:04].

This phenomenon leads to a "stripy pattern" if one could observe which X chromosome has been [[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | inactivated]] in a woman's skin cells, reflecting the growth and migration of the initial 100 embryonic cells [00:03:21].

### [[calico_cats_as_an_example_of_epigenetics | Calico Cats]] as an Example

While not visible in humans, this mosaicism is clearly seen in [[calico_cats_as_an_example_of_epigenetics | Calico cats]] [00:03:44]. The gene for coat color is located on the X chromosome [00:03:48]. By observing the pattern of dark and light spots on a [[calico_cats_as_an_example_of_epigenetics | Calico cat]], one can deduce which X chromosome (from the mother or father) has been [[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | inactivated]] in different patches of fur [00:03:53]. This also explains why only female cats can be [[calico_cats_as_an_example_of_epigenetics | Calico cats]], as they are the only ones capable of inheriting two X chromosomes with different color genes [00:04:01].

## Connection to [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | Epigenetics]]

[[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | X chromosome inactivation]] is a specific example of [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | epigenetics]] [00:04:11]. [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | Epigenetics]] generally refers to mechanisms that turn genes on and off across all chromosomes [00:04:19]. For instance, it's [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | epigenetics]] that enables a pancreatic cell to produce insulin by switching on the relevant gene in that cell type while keeping it off elsewhere [00:04:25].

Even more intriguingly, an individual's behaviors can influence their [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | epigenetics]] [00:04:35]. Furthermore, the actions of one's parents or even grandparents can affect current [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | epigenetics]] [00:04:40]. Therefore, an individual is not solely a product of their genetic code or DNA, but also a product of their [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | epigenetics]], which is shaped by personal behavior and ancestral actions [00:04:47].

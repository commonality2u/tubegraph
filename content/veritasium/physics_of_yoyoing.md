Ben Conde, a renowned yoyoer, demonstrates complex yoyo tricks, including techniques where the string is not connected to the yoyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Understanding how these intricate maneuvers are possible involves several principles of [[physics_of_spinning_flywheels | physics]].

## Basic Yoyo Mechanics

When a yoyo is released, it unspools as it falls, converting its initial gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy and rotational energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Yoyos are designed to spin exceptionally fast, often reaching speeds of around 6,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This speed is comparable to that of most car engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### [[gyroscopic_stability_in_yoyos | Gyroscopic Stability]]

The rapid spin rate of a yoyo is crucial because it provides [[gyroscopic_stability_in_yoyos | gyroscopic stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This stability ensures that the yoyo's axis of rotation is maintained, even when subjected to minor disturbances like a breeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Due to its significant angular momentum, the yoyo continues to spin in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Retrieving the Yoyo

To get the yoyo to return, a specific action is performed:

*   **String Binding:** When Ben tugs the string, he pulls it from one side of the yoyo to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. As the yoyo continues to spin, this action binds the string to the spool, causing the yoyo to roll back up the string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The exact moment of this binding can be observed, which prevents the yoyo from unravelling further and falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## [[stringless_yoyo_techniques | Stringless Yoyo Techniques]]

For [[stringless_yoyo_techniques | stringless yoyo techniques]], the initial release is key:

*   **Release:** The yoyo is thrown outward and upward without a pull back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This allows the yoyo to completely unspool and continue spinning at its high rate of rotation, now detached from the string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Catching:** To catch a freely spinning yoyo with just a string, it relies on [[friction_and_angular_momentum_in_yoyos | friction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   **Friction Pads:** Modern yoyos contain [[friction_and_angular_momentum_in_yoyos | friction pads]], often made of silicone, inside a small gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. When the string is lodged into this gap, it catches on these pads, and the yoyo begins to roll back up the string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
    *   **Belt Friction Equation:** Even without specific friction pads, wrapping the string around the axle creates significant [[friction_and_angular_momentum_in_yoyos | friction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This principle is similar to how ropes wrapped around bollards can hold large ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The amount of tension a coiled rope or string can hold is described by the belt friction equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This equation demonstrates that the force the string can exert on the yoyo increases exponentially with the angle the string makes around the axle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Even a few turns around the yoyo's axle can generate enough [[friction_and_angular_momentum_in_yoyos | friction]] for Ben to pull it back into his hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

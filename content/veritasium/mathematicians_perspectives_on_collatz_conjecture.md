The [[Collatz Conjecture Explanation | Collatz Conjecture]] is considered "the most dangerous problem in mathematics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, with young mathematicians often warned against spending time on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Despite its simple premise, even the world's best mathematicians have been unable to solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. As famous mathematician Paul Erdos stated, "Mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Collatz Rules and Conjecture
The [[Collatz Conjecture Explanation | Collatz Conjecture]] operates on a simple set of rules for any positive integer:
*   If the number is odd, multiply it by three and add one (3N+1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   If the number is even, divide it by two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The conjecture posits that every positive integer, when these rules are applied repeatedly, will eventually enter the "four, two, one loop" (4 → 2 → 1 → 4...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. For example, starting with seven:
7 (odd) → 22 (even) → 11 (odd) → 34 (even) → 17 (odd) → 52 (even) → 26 (even) → 13 (odd) → 40 (even) → 20 (even) → 10 (even) → 5 (odd) → 16 (even) → 8 (even) → 4 (even) → 2 (even) → 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Naming and Reputation
This problem is most commonly known as the [[Collatz Conjecture Explanation | Collatz Conjecture]], named after German mathematician Luther Collatz, who may have conceived it in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. However, it has numerous origin stories and names, including the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Among professional mathematicians, it is often considered "infamous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

> "If someone actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

## Characteristics of Collatz Sequences
The numbers generated by applying the 3x+1 rules are often called "hailstone numbers" due to their tendency to rise and fall like hailstones before eventually "falling down to one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The number of steps it takes for a sequence to reach one is called its "total stopping time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
For instance, starting with 27, the sequence can climb to a peak of 9,232 (higher than Mount Everest in altitude analogy) before eventually falling to one in 111 steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The diverse paths numbers take, even those adjacent to each other, highlight the challenge in making progress on this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Jeffrey Lagarias, recognized as the world authority on 3x+1, has advised aspiring mathematicians against working on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

> "Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while to establish yourself." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>

### Analysis and Patterns in Sequences
Despite the warnings, mathematicians continue to explore the [[Strategies and Challenges in Solving Collatz Conjecture | Collatz Conjecture]].

*   **Randomness and Brownian Motion**: Alex Kontorovich and Yakov Sinai examined the paths of hailstone numbers, finding that the pattern is one of randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. When taking the logarithm of large numbers in a sequence, the graph shows a downward trend with "wiggly" fluctuations that resemble geometric Brownian motion, similar to the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This means that if the linear trend is removed, the fluctuations are random, like coin flips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

*   **Benford's Law**: Analyzing the leading digit of numbers in Collatz sequences reveals a pattern consistent with Benford's law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. For the first billion sequences, approximately 30% of numbers start with one, 17.5% with two, and the frequency decreases for higher digits, with fewer than 5% starting with nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Benford's law is a widespread distribution found in various natural datasets and is even used for fraud detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. However, this law cannot confirm whether all numbers will reach the 4-2-1 loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

*   **Statistical Shrinkage**: Although odd numbers are more than tripled and even numbers are only halved, statistically, Collatz sequences are more likely to shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This is because every time an odd number is multiplied by three and one is added, the result is always an even number, which then undergoes division by two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This means odd numbers are effectively increased by a factor of roughly three over two (3/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. When considering the path from one odd number to the next odd number in a sequence, the geometric mean indicates an average multiplication factor of three over four (3/4), which is less than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

*   **Visualizations**: The paths of numbers in the [[Collatz Conjecture Explanation | Collatz Conjecture]] can be visualized as a directed graph, resembling a tree or converging streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. If the conjecture holds true, every number would connect to this central graph, eventually flowing into the 4-2-1 loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Rotating the graph based on odd (anticlockwise) or even (clockwise) numbers creates intricate, organic shapes resembling coral or seaweed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## [[Potential Evidence and Counterexamples for Collatz Conjecture | Potential Evidence and Counterexamples]]
The [[Collatz Conjecture Explanation | Collatz Conjecture]] could be disproven in two ways:
1.  A sequence of numbers that grows to infinity without ever returning to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
2.  A sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop other than the 4-2-1 cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### Brute Force Testing
Mathematicians have extensively tested numbers by brute force, confirming that every single number up to 2^68 (over 295 quintillion numbers) eventually reaches one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This suggests the conjecture is highly likely to be true, as any other loop would have to be at least 186 billion numbers long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. However, this empirical evidence does not constitute a mathematical proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

### Searching for Counterexamples
Some mathematicians suggest focusing more effort on finding counterexamples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

> "Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples than we're currently spending." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>

The Polya conjecture, proposed in 1919, asserted that the majority of natural numbers up to any given number have an odd number of prime factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. It was disproven by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 with a counterexample at 1.845 x 10^361 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, a number vastly larger than those checked for the Collatz conjecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. This highlights that even extensive computational checks cannot definitively prove a conjecture for all numbers.

### Negative Numbers
If negative numbers are included in the Collatz rules, three independent loops are found, starting at low values like -17 and -5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The existence of these multiple, disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line raises questions about why they aren't found on the positive side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

## Recent Progress and Limitations
One approach to proving the [[Collatz Conjecture Explanation | Collatz Conjecture]] is to show that every sequence eventually reaches a number smaller than its original seed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. If this were proven, it would imply all sequences eventually reach one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

*   In 1976, Riho Terras demonstrated that "almost all" Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. This limit was progressively reduced by subsequent mathematicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   In 2019, Terry Tao, one of the greatest living mathematicians, further showed that "almost all numbers" in a 3x+1 sequence will end up smaller than any arbitrarily slow-growing function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. This means for almost all numbers, there will be an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

> In a 2020 public talk, Terry Tao stated, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture without actually solving it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

However, the term "almost all numbers" has a specific mathematical definition: as the numbers examined go to infinity, the fraction that obeys the criteria goes to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This does not preclude the existence of an infinite number of exceptions, just as "almost all numbers are not perfect squares" does not mean there are no perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Thus, Tao's impressive result is still not a full proof of the conjecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Undecidability
Another possibility is that the [[Collatz Conjecture Explanation | Collatz Conjecture]] is "undecidable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. In 1987, John Conway created a generalization of 3x+1 called FRACTRAN, a mathematical machine that is Turing-complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. This means it can perform any computation a modern computer can, but it is also subject to the halting problem, where the machine might never stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. While this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject to the halting problem, it suggests the possibility that a proof or disproof of the conjecture might be inherently impossible given current knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

## Conclusion
The [[Collatz Conjecture Explanation | Collatz Conjecture]] reveals the peculiar nature of numbers, demonstrating how a simple operation can lead to intricate, organic-looking, and thus far, intractable structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. The difficulty in determining if all numbers connect to the main structure or if some unique thread runs off to infinity underscores the challenges in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. As one mathematician states:

> "It just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>

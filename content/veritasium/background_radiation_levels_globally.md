Radiation, particularly [[understanding_ionizing_radiation | ionizing radiation]], can be frightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Ionizing radiation possesses enough energy to rip electrons off atoms and is measured in units called Sieverts (CTS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Exposure to more than two Sieverts all at once is likely to be fatal shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Common Sources of Ionizing Radiation

Despite its potential danger, humans are constantly exposed to low levels of [[radiation_exposure_in_daily_life_and_occupations | ionizing radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>:
*   **Bananas:** Bananas contain naturally radioactive potassium, exposing a person to about 0.1 micro Sieverts (µSv) of radiation when consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This dose is 1/10 millionth of a Sievert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Human Proximity:** People become radioactive themselves after eating bananas, leading to a slight increase in radiation exposure when sleeping next to someone compared to sleeping alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This dose is considered insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Earth's Natural Background Radiation

The Earth itself contributes significantly to natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. [[understanding_ionizing_radiation | Ionizing radiation]] emanates from the soil, rocks, air, and even from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Global Average:** The typical level of background radiation globally ranges between 0.1 and 0.2 micro Sieverts per hour (µSv/hr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Sydney, Australia:** The radiation level in Sydney is approximately 0.15 micro Sieverts per hour, which is considered about average globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Radiation Levels in Specific Locations

While natural background levels are generally low, some places have significantly higher radiation levels:

### [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Hiroshima]], Japan
Nearly 70 years after the first nuclear bomb was detonated over Hiroshima, the radiation level is only about 0.3 micro Sieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Uranium Mine (Marie Curie's Source)
An old uranium mine, where uranium was discovered and Marie Curie obtained her raw material, shows levels around 1.7 micro Sieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This is about 10 times the natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Small pieces of fluorescent uranium ore can still be found in the walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Marie Curie's Lab:** In Marie Curie's lab, certain items remain radioactive, such as a doorknob (about 10 times background) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> and the back of her chair, where alpha particles can still be detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Trinity Bomb Test Site]], New Mexico
At the site of the world's first nuclear bomb detonation, the radiation level is around 0.8 micro Sieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The heat from the bomb fused desert sand into a green glass called Trinitite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, which is slightly more radioactive, with readings of 2 or 3 micro Sieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Airplanes
Radiation levels increase with altitude due to less atmospheric shielding from [[effects_of_cosmic_rays_on_aviation_and_space_missions | cosmic rays]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>:
*   18,000 feet: Up to 0.5 micro Sieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   23,000 feet: Up to 1 micro Sievert per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>
*   33,000 feet: Over 2 micro Sieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>
*   Even higher altitudes and towards the poles: Over 3 micro Sieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>

### [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Chernobyl]], Ukraine
*   **Exclusion Zone:** In the Chernobyl exclusion zone, radiation readings are around 5 micro Sieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Staying for one hour would result in a dose similar to a dental x-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The levels are not higher because several meters of topsoil were removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Pripyat Hospital Basement:** The basement of the hospital in Pripyat, where firemen's contaminated clothing from the Chernobyl reactor fire was dumped, is one of the most radioactive places on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Readings just outside the door reached 500 micro Sieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, and inside, they reached 1,500 micro Sieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. An hour in this basement would result in a dose of 2,000 micro Sieverts, equivalent to a year's worth of natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Fukushima]] Exclusion Zone, Japan
The Fukushima exclusion zone, though having a smaller release of radioactive material (about 10% of Chernobyl's), is "much fresher" (only 3 years since the accident at the time of filming) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Readings here are around 5 to 10 micro Sieverts per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Similar to Chernobyl, the Japanese are removing meters of contaminated topsoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. People living around Fukushima are estimated to receive an additional 10,000 micro Sieverts over their lifetime due to the disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Comparative Radiation Doses

Radiation doses are often compared to the "banana equivalent dose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>:
*   **CT Scan:** A patient receives about 7,000 micro Sieverts, which is equivalent to 3 years of natural background radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **[[radiation_exposure_in_daily_life_and_occupations | Radiation Workers]]:** Limited to a maximum of 50,000 micro Sieverts per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **[[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | Astronauts]]:** An astronaut on the International Space Station for six months receives about 80,000 micro Sieverts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Smoker's Lungs:** On average, a smoker's lungs receive 160,000 micro Sieverts of radiation every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This high dose is due to radioactive polonium and lead present in tobacco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, contributing to [[health_impacts_of_radiation_exposure | health impacts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Surprisingly, the highest doses of [[understanding_ionizing_radiation | ionizing radiation]] are received not by residents of Fukushima or Chernobyl, nor by radiation workers or astronauts, but by average smokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

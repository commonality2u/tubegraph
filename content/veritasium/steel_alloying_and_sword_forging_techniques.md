Japanese swords are renowned for their exceptional strength and sharpness, capable of slicing a bullet in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The method of making these swords has remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years, with everything done by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. These swords are still considered among the best in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, with one 16th-century example appraised at $105 million, making it the most expensive sword ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

## Steel: The Primary Material
Steel is an alloy of iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>, the fourth-most common element in Earth's crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Alloys are generally stronger than pure metals because they contain different sized atoms, which reduces the ability of atoms to slide past each other under force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

### The Role of Carbon
Adding a small amount of carbon to iron creates the incredibly strong alloy known as steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. Carbon atoms, being much smaller than iron atoms, fit within the iron's crystal lattice, applying an outward force and putting the steel under stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>.

The higher the carbon percentage, the harder and more rigid the steel becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>. However, this hardness comes at the cost of brittleness, making the steel more prone to chipping and shattering rather than bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>.

## The [[traditional_japanese_sword_making_process | Traditional Japanese Sword Making Process]]

The process of making a Japanese sword begins with steel production and proceeds through meticulous forging, shaping, and finishing steps.

### Steel Production: The Tatara Method
In the Shimane province of Japan, steel is made using the ancient Tatara method, which has been practiced for 1,300 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This method yields the specific steel used in the best Japanese swords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

*   **Raw Materials**: Unlike most of the world's iron supply that comes from banded iron formations, Japan's volcanic geology lacks these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Instead, the Japanese historically sourced iron from [[iron_sand_collection_and_smelting_in_japan | iron sand]] found in rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. By diverting rivers, they could concentrate iron oxides, achieving up to 80% iron oxides by weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, which is purer than high-quality iron ore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. Charcoal, essentially pure carbon, is used to heat the iron oxides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Smelting**: The Tatara smelter is lit for only one night each year, with ceremonial prayers said and the fire lit by a Shinto priest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Workers remain at the smelter for at least 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Iron sand is mixed with water to prevent it from flying up in the flame, though too much water risks an explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.
*   **Temperature Control**: The temperature inside the smelter reaches up to 1500 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, just below iron's melting point (1538 Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. This allows the iron to become soft and malleable enough to clump into a large block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. Historically, huge foot-operated bellows provided the necessary oxygen supply, a continuous full-body effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. Modern smelters use electric bellows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   **Slag Removal**: Impurities like sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon oxides combine with carbon from the charcoal, melting at a lower temperature than iron and flowing to the bottom as slag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. Slag is regularly removed from the smelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
*   **Yield**: After 21 hours of smelting, a total of 614 kg of iron sand and 670 kg of charcoal yield a 100 kg block of steel, iron, and slag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. Only about a third of this block is high enough quality for sword making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.

### Forging the Blade
The steel is sorted by quality and carbon content, a skill typically learned by eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. The different grades are then sent to swordsmiths, like Akihara Kokaji, one of 300 in the country, with only 30 working full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

*   **Initial Shaping and Folding**: The steel is heated in a coal oven and flattened with hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. Historically, this involved the swordsmith and three apprentices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>; today, electric hammers are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. The steel is then bent back on itself and hammered together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.
    *   **Purpose of Folding**:
        *   Spreads impurities like silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus uniformly throughout the steel, eliminating weak points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>.
        *   Gives the steel a grain, reinforcing it in the direction of combat strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.
        *   Exposes the steel to air, creating oxidation and darker steel, which forms beautiful patterns when folded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.
    *   A sword is typically folded 10 to 13 times, resulting in a few thousand layers of steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>.
*   **Differential Hardening**: Blades are not made from a single block of steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. Different carbon percentages are used for distinct parts of the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>:
    *   The **edge** uses high-carbon steel for hardness and rigidity to maintain a sharp edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.
    *   The **spine** uses lower-carbon steel to allow the sword to flex without breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00">[16:58:00]</a>.
    *   These pieces of steel with varying carbon content are welded together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.
*   **Quenching**: After hammering the blade into a straight shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>, it is covered in a layer of clay â€“ thick for the spine and thin for the edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>. It is then heated and rapidly cooled in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Material Transformation**:
        *   The **spine** cools slowly due to the thick clay, allowing carbon atoms to leave the iron matrix, forming ferrite and cementite (known as perlite), a mostly soft and ductile form of steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>.
        *   The **edge** cools rapidly due to the thin clay layer, trapping more carbon in the lattice. This forces the lattice structure to change from cubic to tetragonal, forming martensite, an incredibly hard steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Iconic Curve**: The tetragonal lattice of martensite takes up more space, causing the edge to expand relative to the spine, thus curving the sword backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>. This is how the iconic curve of a [[history_of_japanese_swords | samurai sword]] is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>.
    *   **Hamon**: The boundary between these different types of steel is visible in a finished sword as a difference in color, known as hamon, or "edge pattern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Risk**: About one-third of all blades shatter during the quenching process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>.
*   **Tempering**: After quenching, the sword is returned to the forge to evaporate remaining water and loosen some crystal structures, making the sword less brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>.

### Finishing the Sword
*   **Polishing and Sharpening**: The sword is sent to a polisher, where it undergoes a month-long process of hand-polishing and sharpening using whetstones of various coarsenesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>.
*   **Engravings**: Occasionally, swords are engraved with beautiful patterns, though this is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>.

The entire process, from gathering [[iron_sand_collection_and_smelting_in_japan | iron sand]] to the final sharpening, demands immense time, care, and skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>. These discoveries, made through trial and error, resulted in [[artistry_and_craftsmanship_in_japanese_swords | artifacts of such high quality]] that they remain prized centuries later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>.

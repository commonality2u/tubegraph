The mechanical engineering shop at the University of Sydney constructed a specialized apparatus for a series of demonstrations exploring gyroscopic precession and the perceived and actual weight of a spinning object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## The Apparatus

The core of the apparatus is a forty-pound (nineteen kilogram) flywheel attached to the end of a meter-long shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Initial Demonstration: Holding the Flywheel Horizontally

Initially, attempting to hold the apparatus horizontally with one hand at the shaft's end, without the flywheel spinning, is described as "impossible" due to its weight and leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. When spun up to a few thousand RPM, the flywheel demonstrates gyroscopic precession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. In this state, the shaft remains horizontal when held with one hand, and the wheel appears "weightless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Instead of pulling the wheel down as expected, its weight creates a torque that pushes it around in a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This [[counterintuitive_engineering_concepts|counterintuitive engineering concept]] is identified as gyroscopic precession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Extreme Experiment: Lifting the Spinning Flywheel Overhead

A more extreme [[realworld_experiments_and_simulations_demonstrating_the_effect|real-world experiment]] involved attempting to lift the spinning forty-pound (nineteen kilogram) flywheel over the head with one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

Before the attempt, it was verified that lifting the non-spinning flywheel overhead with one hand was extremely difficult, bordering on impossible due to the awkwardness and weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

When the flywheel was spun to its maximum speed, the speaker successfully lifted it overhead multiple times using only one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. It felt "incredibly, incredibly light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, almost as if it "was just wanting to go up by itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the effort required to lift it when not spinning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Perceived vs. Actual Weight
> Despite feeling incredibly light, the flywheel is not weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The apparent lightness is a phenomenon of gyroscopic behavior, not a reduction in mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Scale Experiment: Measuring Actual Weight

To further investigate the phenomenon, an experiment was proposed to measure the actual weight on a scale while lifting the spinning apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

*   The speaker's weight alone was approximately 72 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   When picking up the non-spinning flywheel (approximately 19 kilograms or 42 pounds), the scale read about 91 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

The experiment concluded with a challenge to predict whether the scale reading would be more than, less than, or equal to 91 kilograms when the spinning flywheel was lifted overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

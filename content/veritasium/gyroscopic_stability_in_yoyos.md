When a yo-yo is released, it unspools as it falls, converting its gravitational potential energy into kinetic and rotational energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Yo-yos can achieve very high spin speeds, reaching around 6,000 revolutions per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. This speed is comparable to that of most car engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

This rapid rotation is crucial because it provides the yo-yo with [[gyroscopic_effect_and_bicycle_stability | gyroscopic stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. [[gyroscopic_effect_and_bicycle_stability | Gyroscopic stability]] ensures that the yo-yo's axis of rotation is maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, even when subjected to external disturbances like a breeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Because the yo-yo possesses significant angular momentum, it continues to spin in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This stability is fundamental to performing complex tricks, especially when the string is not directly connected to the yo-yo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

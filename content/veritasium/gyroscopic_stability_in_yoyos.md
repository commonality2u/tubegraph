Yo-yos are often seen performing incredible feats, including seemingly defying gravity and remaining stable in mid-air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This stability is primarily due to [[Gyroscopic effect and bike stability | gyroscopic stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## How a Yo-Yo Gains Energy and Speed

When a yo-yo is released, it unspools as it falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. During this descent, it gains kinetic energy and rotational energy, converting its initial gravitational potential energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Yo-yos can achieve very high spin speeds, reaching approximately 6,000 revolutions per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This speed is comparable to how fast most car engines can turn over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## The Role of Gyroscopic Stability

The high rate of rotation is crucial because it provides the yo-yo with [[Gyroscopic effect and bike stability | gyroscopic stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This means that the yo-yo's axis of rotation is maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Even in the presence of disturbances like a breeze, the yo-yo will continue to spin along its established axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Because the yo-yo possesses a significant amount of [[Friction and angular momentum in yoyos | angular momentum]], it continues spinning in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Returning the Yo-Yo

While gyroscopic stability keeps the yo-yo spinning, its return mechanism relies on other principles of [[Physics of yoyoing | physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. When the string is tugged from one side of the yo-yo to the other, it binds to the spool, causing the yo-yo to roll up the string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Modern yo-yos often incorporate friction pads, typically made of silicone, inside the yo-yo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. When the string enters a small gap, it creates [[Friction and angular momentum in yoyos | friction]] with these pads, allowing the yo-yo to roll up while spinning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Even without friction pads, wrapping the string around the axle creates substantial [[Friction and angular momentum in yoyos | friction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This is similar to how ropes wrapped around bollards hold large ships to docks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The tension a coiled rope or string can hold is described by the belt [[Friction and angular momentum in yoyos | friction]] equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This equation demonstrates that the force the string can exert on the yo-yo increases exponentially with the angle the string makes around the axle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Therefore, even a few turns around the yo-yo allow it to be pulled back into the hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

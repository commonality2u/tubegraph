[[Properties of aerogel | Aerogel]], often referred to as the world's lightest solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, possesses extraordinary qualities, but its inherent brittleness presents significant challenges for practical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Inherent Brittleness
The fragility of aerogel was recognized by its inventor, [[History and invention of aerogel | Samuel Kistler]], as early as 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It exhibits a metallic ring when tapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Despite its remarkable [[Aerogel as a thermal insulator | thermal insulation capabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, it breaks "pretty easily," requiring very little force to fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Improving Usability
To make aerogel more usable, particularly given its "extraordinary" [[Thermal insulation capabilities of aerogel | thermal insulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, researchers have developed methods to enhance its mechanical properties.

### Aerogel Paste with Binder
One approach involves combining silica aerogel particles with a non-flammable binder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This mixture creates a workable paste that can be applied to surfaces, like skin, to provide immediate thermal protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. When a finger coated with this paste is exposed to a blowtorch flame, which can reach 1500-2000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, the aerogel side glows orange hot (around 907 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, yet the finger behind the thin layer feels only warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This demonstrates the paste's effective insulating properties while allowing for application on complex shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Composite Materials
Another strategy to improve aerogel's workability is to incorporate it into composite materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. For example, aerogel blankets are created by infusing fiberglass with aerogel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This [[Applications of aerogel in waterproofing and insulation | composite material]] overcomes the traditional fragility of aerogels, allowing it to be flexed, cut, sewn, and wrapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. These blankets are significantly more insulating than conventional materials; a one-centimeter-thick aerogel blanket provides the same insulation as three centimeters of mineral wool or fiberglass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

While these blankets may shed some amorphous silica dust when tapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, this type of silica is considered very safe, unlike materials such as quartz fiber or asbestos, as it can be readily captured and expelled by the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

These innovations make aerogel suitable for a wide range of [[Practical applications of aerogel | applications]], from insulating subsea oil pipelines and refineries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a> to [[Future uses of aerogel in clothing and space technology | potential future uses in astronaut suits or apparel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

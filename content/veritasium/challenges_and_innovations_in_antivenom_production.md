Antivenom is a life-saving medical product derived from snake and spider venom. At the Australian Reptile Park, for example, venom is extracted from these creatures to produce antivenom that saves lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While Australia reports a low annual snakebite fatality rate of one to three people, global estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest around 120,000 deaths annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Australia benefits from some of the best antivenom products globally and a federally funded program that provides antivenom for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## [[venom_extraction_and_antivenom_production_process | Venom Extraction (Milking)]]

The process of [[venom_extraction_and_antivenom_production_process | venom extraction]], often called "milking," is a dangerous and precise procedure. Staff at facilities like the Australian Reptile Park are surrounded by highly venomous snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, where even a scratch from a species like the coastal taipan can be lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

To extract venom, a snake is carefully pinned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, and its fangs are directed to bite into a shot glass or vial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Snakes aim for a finger rather than the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, making the process high-risk. After the initial bite, the venom glands (located behind the snake's eyes) are massaged to extract every possible drop, as "every drop matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Returning the snake to its enclosure is particularly risky, as it relies on human speed and agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. These tasks consistently cause trembling hands, a sign of the inherent danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Approximately 15 snakes are needed to produce one vial of antivenom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Some facilities also selectively breed snakes to produce more venom than their wild counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. For example, some coastal taipans are bred to produce five to seven times the amount of venom a wild one would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This is achieved by breeding "psychotic" individuals together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. While this practice creates "super snakes" capable of yielding 4.5 to 4.9 grams of venom per bite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, some experts suggest that regular milking, rather than selective breeding, is the primary reason for increased venom yield in captive snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## [[history_and_development_of_antivenom | Historical Development of Antivenom]]

The concept of antivenom dates back to 1870, when British military doctor Edward Nicholson observed snake handlers in Burma intentionally exposing themselves to cobra bites to develop an immune response, becoming less affected by accidental bites over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Twenty years later, in Saigon, French medical researcher Albert Calmette aimed to create a vaccine for snakebites, similar to his work with smallpox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. He began injecting rabbits with minute amounts of cobra venom, gradually increasing the dose over eight months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Eventually, the rabbits could tolerate 15 times the normal lethal dose, having developed antibodies to neutralize the venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Calmette then took the serum containing antibodies from a venom-resistant rabbit and injected it into a rabbit never exposed to venom. This rabbit subsequently survived twice the lethal dose of cobra venom, demonstrating the transfer of immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This marked the creation of the first antivenom, which Calmette called "antivenin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

## [[venom_extraction_and_antivenom_production_process | Current Antivenom Production Process]]

Today, [[venom_extraction_and_antivenom_production_process | antivenoms are made]] in a similar way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>:
1.  Venom is collected and frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
2.  It is then diluted and injected into a donor animal, typically a horse due to its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
3.  Over several months, the horse's immune system builds up immunity as the venom dose is increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
4.  Blood is drawn from the horse, and antibodies are isolated from the plasma; the red blood cells are returned to the horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. These horse antibodies constitute the life-saving antivenom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

Antivenom is effective because human biology shares a common evolutionary history with other mammals, including horses. Horse antibodies are similar enough to human antibodies to bind and neutralize toxic compounds in our bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Snake venom is particularly lethal to humans because we are closely related to rodents, a primary prey of snakes, sharing many biological pathways that venom targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. [[types_and_effects_of_snake_venom_on_humans | Snake venoms]] often contain a complex mix of neurotoxic (affecting the nervous system), hemotoxic (affecting blood), cytotoxic (affecting cells), and myotoxic (affecting muscles) proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, making treatment challenging as multiple toxins need to be neutralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Challenges in Antivenom Production

Despite its life-saving capabilities, the current method of antivenom production faces several challenges:
*   **Danger to Personnel** The process of collecting venom is inherently dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Even a minor scratch can lead to severe medical emergencies, as experienced by Zac, a facility manager, who suffered a scratch requiring 36 hours in ICU, eight of which were in a resus bay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Allergic Reactions** Some individuals, like Zac, are highly allergic to the antivenom itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This requires a complex treatment of alternating antivenom doses with adrenaline to counteract anaphylaxis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Donor Animals** The process involves many donor animals, primarily horses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This can be costly, ethically complex, and subject to biological variations in the animals' immune responses.

## Innovations in Antivenom Production

Scientists are actively exploring [[future_developments_and_challenges_for_aerogel | innovations]] to overcome these challenges. One promising avenue is the possibility of producing antivenom using genetically modified bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. These bacteria would be engineered to produce specific antibodies tailored to neutralize individual toxins within a snake's venom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. While this approach holds significant promise for a safer, more controlled, and potentially more specific antivenom production, it is still under development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. For now, the traditional method remains the standard for saving countless lives globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

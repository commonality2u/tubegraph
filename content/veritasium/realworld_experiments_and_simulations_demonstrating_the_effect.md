The phenomenon known as the Dzhanibekov effect, tennis racket theorem, or intermediate axis theorem, involves an object spontaneously flipping 180 degrees while rotating around its intermediate axis of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This counterintuitive behavior has been observed and demonstrated in various real-world scenarios and explained through theoretical models.

## Initial Discovery and Early Observations

The effect was first dramatically observed in 1985 by cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov while he was saving the Soviet space station Salyut 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While unpacking supplies, Dzhanibekov noticed a wing-nut, spinning off a bolt, would maintain its orientation for a short time, then flip 180 degrees, and subsequently flip back a few seconds later at regular intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This motion occurred without any applied forces or torques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

After observing the wing-nut, Dzhanibekov attached a ball of modeling clay to it and found that this new object also flipped over periodically when spun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The Russians reportedly kept this observation secret for ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Terrestrial Demonstrations

The same effect can be demonstrated on Earth, commonly with a tennis racket. If a tennis racket is flipped in the air while rotating around its intermediate axis (parallel to its head), it will not only rotate as intended but also make a half-turn around an axis through its handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This means the side initially facing the flipper will face away upon catching it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The effect is not limited to tennis rackets; it can be observed with various objects. For instance, cell phones and discs with holes can exhibit the same flipping behavior when spun around their intermediate axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The intermediate axis theorem requires an object to have three different moments of inertia about its three principal axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Objects like spinning rings or those with spherical symmetry, which do not have three different moments of inertia, will not demonstrate the effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Theoretical Explanation and Simulations

While mathematics can explain the effect, an intuitive explanation was provided by mathematician Terry Tao <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. His model involves a thin, rigid, massless disc with heavy point masses on the x-axis and light point masses on the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

In this model:
*   Rotation around the x-axis (light masses moving) has the smallest moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   Rotation about the z-axis (all four masses moving) has the greatest moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   Rotation about the y-axis (intermediate moment of inertia) is where the flipping occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

When the disc is perfectly rotating about the y-axis, centrifugal forces on the heavy masses are balanced by centripetal forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. However, if the disc is slightly bumped, the light masses experience centrifugal forces, accelerating them away from the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. These forces cause the masses to accelerate, flip to opposite sides, then slow down, come to rest, and repeat the pattern indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

A number of simulations and animations have been created to visualize and explain this complex rotational dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Microgravity [[testing_and_experiments_with_kinetic_projectiles|Experiments]] and Stability

The effects of the intermediate axis theorem are more striking in microgravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Astronaut Don Pettit performed [[testing_and_experiments_with_kinetic_projectiles|experiments]] on the space station demonstrating rotational stability:

*   A book spins stably about its first (smallest moment of inertia) or third (largest moment of inertia) axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   A solid cylinder also spins stably around its first or third axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   A liquid-filled cylinder, however, spinning about its first axis (smallest moment of inertia) is unstable and will end up rotating about its axis with the largest moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

This instability in a liquid-filled cylinder or other non-rigid bodies occurs because kinetic energy can be converted into other forms, such as heat, through internal dissipation (e.g., liquid sloshing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. When energy is dissipated, the object seeks the state of minimum kinetic energy for a given angular momentum, which corresponds to rotation about the axis with the largest moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

This principle was tragically learned with the first US satellite, Explorer 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Designed to be spin-stabilized about its long axis, it began rotating end over end within hours of achieving orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Its flexible antennas allowed the satellite to dissipate energy, gradually reducing its kinetic energy until it rotated about the axis maximizing its moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

This explains why celestial bodies like Earth and Mars spin stably about their axis of maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

The fundamental question of "What is light?" has puzzled thinkers for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Early responses to this question range from light being "brightness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, something that "lights up the room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, or even related to "auras" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Some noted its function in enabling sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> and its various colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, the scientific answer to this question was not easily settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Historical Debate on the Nature of Light

For centuries, the greatest scientific minds debated the true nature of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This [[historical_debate_on_the_nature_of_light | historical debate on the nature of light]] primarily centered on two opposing views:
*   **Particle Theory (Corpuscular Theory)**: In the late 1600s, Isaac Newton proposed in his treatise *Opticks* that light was a stream of particles, or corpuscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Wave Theory**: Simultaneously, Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens suggested that light behaved as a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

This debate persisted until it was decisively addressed by [[Thomas Young's double slit experiment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Thomas Young's Original Experiment (1803)

To understand and replicate the [[double_slit_experiment_and_its_implications | experiment]], researchers consulted Thomas Young's handwritten notes from 1803, found in the vault beneath the Royal Society in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Young's notes described his method:
*   He brought a thin slip of card, about one-thirtieth of an inch in breadth, into a sunbeam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   He then observed its shadow on a wall or other cards held at various distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   His observations revealed "fringes of color on each side of the shadow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   Furthermore, "the shadow itself was divided by similar parallel fringes, of smaller dimensions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Recreating the Double Slit Experiment

A modern recreation of the [[double_slit_experiment_and_its_implications | experiment]] was conducted using sunlight, described as simple enough to do at home but fiddly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The setup involved:
*   An empty box with a small eyepiece for observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   A "double slit" slide, featuring two very narrow openings side-by-side, placed above a hole on the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   The box was tilted towards the sun to ensure the sun's rays directly hit the double slit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Expectations vs. Observations

Before looking, participants were asked what they expected to see on the bottom of the box:
*   Many expected to see "two lines" or "two broad-bands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   Others predicted "one line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, the "whole box lit up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, or even a "kaleidoscope" or "bunch of colors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

However, the actual observations were surprising:
*   Instead of two lines, observers saw "dots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   Specifically, there was "one in the middle, the strongest," with "two either side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   The central dot was white, while the outer ones were multicolored, resembling a rainbow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   More dots or "blobs" continued to appear and spread across the viewing area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Explaining the Interference Pattern

The observed pattern of multiple bright and dark spots could not be explained if light were purely particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. If light behaved as particles, one would expect to see only two bright spots directly corresponding to the two slits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

However, the pattern is consistent with light behaving as waves, demonstrating [[interference_patterns_and_light_behavior | interference patterns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Water Wave Analogy

This phenomenon can be illustrated with water waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. When two sources of ripples are created in a pond (acting like the two slits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>:
*   **Constructive Interference**: Where the peaks of waves from one source meet the peaks of waves from the other, or troughs meet troughs, the amplitude of the wave is increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. In the context of light, this creates a bright spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Destructive Interference**: If the peak from one wave meets the trough from the other, they cancel each other out, resulting in "no wave there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. For light, this means no light is seen, creating a dark spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

This process of light "canceling itself out" results in the observed alternating pattern of bright and dark spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Colors and Wavelengths

Sunlight is composed of many different colors, each having a different wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Because different wavelengths meet up at slightly different points during interference, this causes the "rainbowing effects" observed further from the central bright spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. For instance, reds will interfere constructively at different places than blues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The fundamental difference between colors is their wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Conclusion

The compelling results of [[Thomas Young's double slit experiment]] led the scientific community to conclude that light must be a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

> [!question]
> The light observed at the bottom of the box during the experiment was not in the shape of slits but appeared as "round blobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Why is this the case?

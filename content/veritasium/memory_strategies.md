Memory strategies are techniques that individuals employ to improve their recall of information, distinct from [[learning_styles_myth|preferred learning styles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

## How Memory Strategies Work
While many people typically remember about five or six items when presented with a list, some individuals can recall significantly more, such as eight or nine items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. This enhanced recall is often due to the conscious application of [[memorization_techniques_and_expertise|memory strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

Examples of effective memory strategies include:
*   **Ordering and Repetition** Actively creating an internal order for items, adding new information to a list, and mentally repeating the list while processing new items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **Story Creation** Tying individual objects or pieces of information into a cohesive story, which makes the information easier to remember than disconnected facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

## Beyond Learning Styles
Rigorous studies have consistently shown that an individual's self-professed [[learning_styles_myth|learning style]] does not predict better performance when instruction matches that style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. The most critical factor in learning is "what is happening inside the learner's head," not merely how information is presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.

Effective learning occurs when individuals are:
*   Actively thinking about the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.
*   Solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.
*   Imagining the impact of changing variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

## Evidence-Based Approaches to Learning
While [[learning_styles_myth|learning styles]] are not supported by evidence, many other teaching methods are proven to improve learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>.

One highly effective approach is [[multimodal_learning|multimodal learning]], where information is presented using various formats. Everyone learns better through [[multimodal_learning|multimodal approaches]] that combine words and pictures, rather than using words or pictures in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. This phenomenon is known as the multimedia effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. Videos, for example, can be powerful learning tools when narration effectively complements the visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

The most effective learning experiences are those that involve multiple different ways of understanding the same concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. This strategy benefits all learners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.

The kilogram is one of the seven base units in the Systeme International d'unites (SI units), and uniquely, it is the only SI unit still defined by a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Its history reflects attempts to establish a stable and universal measure of mass.

## Early Definitions: The "Grave" and the "Gramme"

The original name for the base unit of mass in the metric system was the "grave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. In 1793, a commission, which included notable scientist and aristocrat [[History of Physics and Mathematics | Antoine Lavoisier]], defined this unit as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting temperature of ice (essentially a liter of ice water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. The name "grave" derived from the Latin "gravitas," meaning weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

However, the name "grave" was short-lived. During the French Revolution, its similarity to the aristocratic title "graf" (equivalent to an earl or count) clashed with the prevailing ethos of equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. [[History of Physics and Mathematics | Lavoisier]] himself was executed, not for his scientific work, but for his role as a tax collector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

The new republican government initially considered the "grave" too large for common measurements and opted for the "gramme," which was one-thousandth of a "grave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. But realizing a gram was too small for practical use, they returned to the original magnitude, naming it the "kilogram" â€“ a thousand grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This is why the kilogram is the only one of the seven base SI units to include a prefix in its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Physical Standards: From Water to Metal Cylinders

In 1799, the kilogram's definition was refined to be the mass of a liter of water at 4 degrees Celsius, the temperature at which water is densest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Recognizing that water is not a practical mass standard, a pure platinum cylinder was created to embody this definition, named the "Kilogram of the Archives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. At this point, the kilogram became defined by this specific physical artifact, rather than by a volume of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

Ninety years later, in 1889, this standard was upgraded to a more durable platinum-iridium alloy cylinder. This new standard, known as the "International Prototype Kilogram" or affectionately "Le Grand K" (Big K), remains the official definition of the kilogram to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Le Grand K is considered the only object in the universe with an exact mass of one kilogram because it *is* the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. It is stored in a climate-controlled vault in the basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris, protected by three bell jars and three independently controlled keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

## Challenges with Physical Mass Standards

Initially, 40 nearly identical replicas of Le Grand K were made and distributed globally as national standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. However, when these kilograms were reunited for weigh-ins in 1948 and again 40 years later, their masses had diverged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. Even Le Grand K's mass varied relative to its six sister cylinders stored alongside it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. These divergences, up to about 50 micrograms (roughly the weight of a fingerprint), indicated that the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder is not stable over time, despite careful washing procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. This [[issues_with_the_stability_of_physical_mass_standards | instability of physical mass standards]] is a significant problem, as a fundamental unit should not change its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. The issue's impact extends beyond mass measurements, as four of the seven base SI units and many derived units (like Newtons, Joules, Volts, and Watts) depend on the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. Even the avoirdupois pound used in some countries is defined based on the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

## Modern Redefinition Efforts

To eliminate the kilogram's dependence on a physical object, scientists have been working on new definitions.

### The Silicon-28 Sphere

One promising approach involves [[redefining_the_kilogram_using_silicon28_atoms | redefining the kilogram using silicon28 atoms]], specifically through a perfect, pure sphere of silicon-28 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

*   **Composition**: The sphere is made of highly pure silicon, containing only the silicon-28 isotope, which contributes to its high cost (raw material alone worth 1 million Euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.
*   **Roundness**: It is considered the "roundest object in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. If the sphere were the size of the Earth, the difference between its highest "mountain" and lowest "valley" would be only about 14 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This extreme roundness is achieved by starting with an oversized sphere and grinding it progressively finer, "massaging atoms" to control its shape at an atomic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
*   **Measurement**: Its diameter is precisely measured using lasers, which allows for the determination of its volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. Since the atomic spacing in silicon is known with high precision, the number of atoms in the sphere can be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.
*   **Redefinition**: This method aims to redefine Avogadro's constant. Currently, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram (number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. Under the new approach, the fixed number of silicon atoms in the sphere would fix Avogadro's constant, which would then in turn define the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. This would mean that even if the physical silicon sphere were lost, the definition of the kilogram would remain stable, based on a fixed concept rather than a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. The ideal definition would be "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

### Other Approaches

There are [[alternate_approaches_to_defining_the_kilogram | alternate approaches to defining the kilogram]], including fixing Planck's constant using a Watt Balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. Both the silicon sphere and Watt Balance methods are complementary, providing checks on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. If these approaches achieve good agreement and reduce uncertainties, the kilogram could be redefined, becoming an unchanging unit no longer reliant on a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. The Watt Balance method currently appears to be the frontrunner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.

## Historical Accuracy

Despite the challenges of defining the kilogram, the original 1799 definition based on a liter of water was remarkably accurate. A liter of water at nearly four degrees Celsius has a mass of 999.975 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. This means the platinum cylinder created 214 years ago was correct within the margin of error of a grain of rice, a truly remarkable achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. [[History of Physics and Mathematics | Antoine Lavoisier]], who contributed to the initial definition of the kilogram, also first conceived of silicon as an element, connecting him to the kilogram's definition from start to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.

Nitinol is a remarkable metal, often described as being "as close to magic as it is possible to find in nature" due to its unique properties [00:00:00]. This alloy can adjust its atomic arrangement to return to a predefined shape [00:00:05], convert between mechanical and thermal energy [00:00:11], and stretch up to 30 times more than ordinary metals while still returning to its original size [00:00:16]. These capabilities have led to its use in diverse applications, from medical devices and toys to bulletproof bike tires and even revolutionizing wheel design for space exploration [00:00:27].

## Discovery of Nitinol

Nitinol was discovered in 1961 at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory during experiments with alloys of nickel and titanium [00:08:52]. An associate technical director, a pipe smoker, applied heat from his lighter to a sample that had been repeatedly worked, heated, and cooled [00:09:03]. To everyone's surprise, the material changed shape [00:09:14]. This unexpected behavior led to further investigations, and the material was named Nitinol, combining its elemental components (Nickel, Titanium) with its discovery location (Naval Ordnance Laboratory) [00:09:22].

## Properties of Nitinol

Nitinol exhibits two primary unique properties: the shape memory effect and superelasticity. Both are rooted in its ability to undergo solid-state phase changes.

### The Shape Memory Effect

The [[shape_memory_alloys | shape memory effect]] in Nitinol is due to its ability to undergo a solid-state phase change [00:09:35].
*   **Austenite Phase:** When heated, Nitinol atoms are arranged in a cubic lattice, known as the austenite phase [00:09:40]. This is the "parent" or "memory" shape [00:10:32].
*   **Twinned Martensite Phase:** Upon cooling, the atoms transition into a messier, lower-symmetry arrangement called twinned martensite [00:09:47].
*   **Detwinned Martensite Phase:** In the twinned martensite phase, the material can be deformed by applying stress. Unlike ordinary metals, this deformation does not involve breaking atomic bonds or moving dislocations; instead, the crystal structure changes to a detwinned form of martensite [00:10:00].
*   **Shape Recovery:** When the material is heated again, it transforms from martensite back to austenite, causing the atoms to return to their original locations and the material to regain its original, predefined shape [00:10:17]. This process allows Nitinol to "remember" its shape even after significant deformation [00:10:46]. The speed of this transformation depends on how quickly heat can be conducted to or from the material [00:11:36].

The temperature at which Nitinol transitions between austenite and martensite can be precisely tuned between -150°C and -350°C by altering the ratio of its elements and applying specific heat treatments [00:13:51].

#### Applications of Shape Memory

*   **Medical Devices:** [[material_science_in_robotic_engineering | Nitinol]] is used in medical stents. These stents are cooled into the martensite phase, crushed or elongated to become thin, inserted into the body via a catheter, and then heated (by body temperature) to deploy, expanding to open arteries [00:11:50].
*   **Actuators:** [[material_science_in_robotic_engineering | Shape memory alloys]] can generate significant forces when heated, making them suitable as actuators [00:12:14]. For example, a Nitinol wire can lift considerable weight (up to 20 pounds, or 90 Newtons of force) when heated [00:12:30]. They have even been used to fracture rock [00:12:50].
*   **Aviation:** [[material_science_in_robotic_engineering | Shape memory alloys]] are being investigated for use in aviation.
    *   **Vortex Generators:** These small fins on aircraft wings are crucial for takeoff and landing to manage airflow and prevent stalls [00:13:00]. At cruise altitude, they become a drag penalty. Nitinol vortex generators can be designed to autonomously stow flat when the plane reaches colder cruise temperatures (-50°C to -60°C) and then return to their upright position as the plane heats up during descent for landing [00:13:14]. This passive temperature-driven response eliminates the need for complex control systems [00:13:41].
    *   **Main Flaps:** This principle has been extended to control main aircraft flaps [00:14:18]. By using controlled heating elements rather than passive temperature changes, [[material_science_in_robotic_engineering | Nitinol]] tubes can replace entire hydraulic systems for flap actuation, allowing for 60 degrees of flap angle down and 30 degrees up on a 737 aircraft [00:14:27]. This simplification removes weight and maintenance needs associated with hydraulics [00:14:50].

### Superelasticity (Pseudoelasticity)

[[shape_memory_alloys | Shape memory alloys]] can also exhibit superelasticity, or pseudoelasticity, allowing them to stretch up to 8% of their length and return to their original size [00:15:05]. This phenomenon is distinct from the shape memory effect.

*   **Stress-Induced Phase Change:** Superelasticity occurs when the Nitinol is already in its austenite phase (meaning its transition temperature is lower than the ambient temperature) [00:16:01]. By applying stress, the crystal structure is forced to change from austenite directly into detwinned martensite, even without a temperature change [00:16:07].
*   **Reversible Deformation:** This rearrangement allows significant deformation (up to 8%) [00:16:17]. When the stress is removed, the atoms immediately spring back to the austenite phase, and the material returns to its original configuration [00:16:23]. The "crunchy" or "pinging" sound heard during this process indicates the stress-induced phase change in the solid state [00:15:21]. This is different from the elastic regime of most materials, where deformation is due to atomic flexing [00:05:40].
*   **Comparison to Ordinary Metals:** Ordinary metals can only withstand elastic strain of about 0.3% to 0.8% before undergoing plastic deformation (permanent change) or fracturing [00:06:35]. Nitinol's ability to stretch by 8% and still recover is vastly superior [00:15:42]. For example, a brass tube would buckle and permanently deform if bent similarly [00:17:08].

### Thermal Energy Conversion (Elastocalorics)

When Nitinol undergoes a stress-induced phase change from austenite to detwinned martensite (higher symmetry to lower symmetry), it is an exothermic process, releasing heat [00:17:35]. Conversely, when the stress is removed, and the material reverts to the austenite phase, it's an endothermic process, absorbing heat [00:18:04]. This property is explored in the field of elastocalorics for applications like heat pumping or refrigeration [00:18:17].

## Nitinol in Wheel Technology

[[material_science_in_robotic_engineering | Nitinol's]] properties make it ideal for creating highly durable and adaptable wheels, particularly for extreme environments like space.

### Bulletproof Bicycle Tires

NASA's research into space mission wheels has directly led to bulletproof bicycle tires [00:03:00]. These tires do not require air pressure; their structure and shock absorption are provided by internal metal structures resembling a [[physics_of_a_metal_ring_and_chain_trick | slinky]] [00:01:01]. This design allows them to maintain performance even after being punctured by nails or shot by bullets [00:01:13]. The tire's resilience is demonstrated by it riding normally even with a nail embedded or a bullet hole cleanly through it [00:01:55].

### Wheels for Space Exploration

Designing wheels for other planets is challenging due to the harsh conditions:
*   **Atmospheric Pressure:** Low or no atmospheric pressure means traditional rubber pneumatic tires can't be used as they could explode [00:03:14].
*   **Extreme Temperatures:** Temperatures can swing wildly, from 250°F (121°C) in the sun to -250°F (-157°C) in shadow [00:03:29]. Rubber becomes brittle at low temperatures; its "glass transition temperature" is around 90°C below zero, making it rigid and prone to shattering, as demonstrated by rubber exploding after being dipped in liquid nitrogen [00:03:42].
*   **Weight Constraints:** Launching matter into space is very expensive, so wheels must be as lightweight as possible [00:04:20].

#### Limitations of Previous Rover Wheels

*   **Curiosity Rover Wheels (Aluminum):** Made from single billets of aluminum for strength and to avoid failure points from fasteners or welds [00:04:08]. To meet mass limitations, the skin was made incredibly thin (0.7 millimeters, thinner than a credit card) [00:04:28]. However, the aggressive terrain on Mars caused much higher peak loads than predicted, leading to significant holes and cracks in the wheels, affecting rover performance and efficiency [00:04:42]. This damage is a result of the material exceeding its yield strength, leading to plastic deformation and eventual fracture [00:05:56].
*   **Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) Wheels (Steel Mesh):** These wheels used a pantograph structure of woven steel wires [00:07:10]. They featured tread strips to prevent sinking and maintain flexibility [00:07:28]. An internal "bump stop" was used to limit deformation and prevent the steel mesh from exceeding its proportional limit, thus avoiding plastic deformation [00:07:58]. While effective for short missions (farthest traveled was 36 kilometers) [00:07:44], this design would not prevent plastic deformation from accumulating over longer journeys, as observed in Mars steel spring tires that showed permanent deformation after testing [00:08:18].

#### Nitinol Wheels: The Solution

The ideal material for space wheels needs to be strong and durable like steel but capable of enduring much greater strain without permanent deformation [00:08:41]. [[shape_memory_alloys | Nitinol]] provides this solution.

*   **Structure:** NASA's Nitinol tires are constructed by weaving Nitinol springs together into a mesh [00:19:37]. The process of interweaving individual springs is tedious and time-consuming, with 684 springs per tire [00:20:00].
*   **Performance:** The superelasticity of Nitinol allows the wheels to deform up to 8% without permanent damage, which is crucial for long space missions on rough terrain [00:21:38]. This is a significant improvement over previous wheel designs.
*   **Load Distribution:** The design incorporates an element that, when tied into the wheel, allows loads to be transferred 360 degrees around the tire from the footprint. This significantly increases load-carrying capacity without adding mass [00:19:15].
*   **Shock Absorption:** The material's dissipation potential acts like a shock absorber or damper, allowing the tire itself to perform some of the dissipation functions, potentially making the tire a complete suspension system and simplifying vehicle design for space [00:18:37].
*   **Testing:** Nitinol wheels are extensively tested on terrain endurance rigs that simulate lunar and Martian surfaces, including sand, small rocks, and larger obstacles [00:20:16]. These tests confirm their ability to support the weight of a vehicle and crew while navigating challenging environments at typical rover speeds (around 6.7 cm/s) [00:20:49].

### Terrestrial Applications for Nitinol Tires

The advancements in Nitinol tire technology for space also have significant terrestrial applications:
*   **Aircraft Tires:** Conventional aircraft tires are pressurized to very high levels (300-400 psi), which carries a risk of explosion [00:22:11]. They also require constant air pressure checks, impacting fuel economy and safety [00:22:31]. Nitinol-based structural tire systems eliminate reliance on air, removing these issues [00:22:54].
*   **Off-Road Vehicles:** Nitinol tires have been tested on a Jeep, demonstrating their ability to handle off-road conditions without relying on pressurized air [00:23:03]. This means no flat tires and consistent performance, as they can never be underinflated, leading to improved fuel economy [00:23:07].

With its ability to adapt and recover from extreme deformation, Nitinol promises to enable airless tires for various applications, from everyday vehicles to aircraft and future planetary rovers [00:23:15].

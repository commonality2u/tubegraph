The Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics, formulated by Hugh Everett, proposes a way to understand quantum phenomena without the need for a "wavefunction collapse" upon measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>. It offers a more consistent and logical framework for quantum mechanics, suggesting that the wavefunction is the complete picture of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:46">[05:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:54">[12:00:54]</a>.

## The Quantum Measurement Problem

In classical mechanics, knowing a system's state (e.g., a particle's position and velocity) allows for deterministic future calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. In quantum mechanics, the [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]] of a particle evolves smoothly according to the Schrödinger equation, usually spreading out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, when measured, the particle is always found at a single point in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This discrepancy between the spread-out [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]] and point-like detection is known as the quantum measurement problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Early quantum theorists, like Max Born, proposed that the square of the [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]]'s complex amplitude at any point in space gives the probability of finding the particle there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This "Born rule" introduced probability into the core of reality, making the universe non-deterministic, which made many scientists, including Einstein, uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. The standard interpretation suggests two rules: the [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]] evolves via the Schrödinger equation when unobserved, but "collapses" suddenly and irreversibly upon measurement, with probabilities determined by the Born rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Schrödinger's Cat and Its Resolution

Erwin Schrödinger invented the famous Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment to highlight the absurdity of the "collapse" formulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. In this scenario, a cat in a box is entangled with a radioactive atom, such that if the atom decays, the cat dies, and if it doesn't decay, the cat lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. According to the standard interpretation, until observed, the cat exists in a superposition of both alive and dead states simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Only upon opening the box and making a measurement does the [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]] collapse, and the cat becomes definitively alive or dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Schrödinger's intention was to show that this formulation was flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Core Concepts Validated

To propose a better way of thinking about Schrödinger's Cat and quantum mechanics, three essential components are examined: superposition, entanglement, and measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

1.  **Superposition**: The idea that quantum objects can be in multiple states simultaneously is evidenced by the double-slit experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. A single electron, when fired through two slits, creates an interference pattern, forcing the conclusion that it passes through both slits simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. This is easily understood with waves, and since electrons are represented by [[wave_particle_duality | wave functions]], superposition is on solid ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. [[de_broglies_hypothesis_and_waveparticle_duality | De Broglie]] notably suspected that matter has [[wave_particle_duality | wave-like properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
2.  **Entanglement**: When two particles interact, they become described by a single [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]], rather than separate ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. This explains why measuring the momentum of one entangled electron instantaneously reveals the momentum of the other, even if they are light-years apart, to conserve momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
3.  **Measurement**: The MWI proposes throwing out the measurement postulate entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Instead of a special rule for measurement, measurement is simply the interaction of one quantum system with another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

### Environmental Decoherence and Branching

In the [[many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many Worlds Interpretation]], when an observer opens Schrödinger's box, there is no measurement or [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]] collapse. Instead, the observer (who is also made of quantum particles) becomes entangled with the state of everything inside the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. The observer sees both an alive cat and a dead cat, because the "you" that saw the cat alive and the "you" that saw it dead inhabit separate realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

This branching occurs due to **environmental decoherence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. If a quantum object in a superposition becomes entangled with its environment (e.g., air molecules, photons), the [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]] of the universe branches, essentially splitting the universe into two slightly different copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. For the Schrödinger's cat, the detector becomes entangled with the atom's superposition, then decoheres by interacting with the environment, causing the [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]] to branch. At that moment, the observer is split into two identical copies, each entangled with one outcome (alive or dead cat), and they cease to be identical once they open the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

## Implications of Many Worlds

*   **Deterministic Universe**: In MWI, the universe goes back to being deterministic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. Every outcome happens 100% of the time, but observers only experience their specific "sliver" of the multiverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.
*   **Wavefunction as Reality**: The [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]] itself is considered the complete picture of reality, and our measurements are just tiny fractions of it, the part we become entangled with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.
*   **Infinite Worlds**: The branching of the [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]] is happening constantly, potentially at an infinite rate, creating infinite, subtly different worlds all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. This is a natural consequence of the mathematics of quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

## [[Theoretical_analyses_and_misconceptions | Objections and Misconceptions]]

Sean Carroll, a Caltech professor and author of a book on many worlds, addresses common questions and objections regarding the [[many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many Worlds Interpretation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.

### Energy Conservation

It is a common question how energy is conserved if new worlds are constantly being created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>. In MWI, the energy of the total [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]] of the universe is 100% conserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. The branching is not about duplicating the entire universe, but rather subdividing a certain amount of the universe into pieces. The pieces may appear identical from the inside, but they contribute less than the original to the total energy of everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

### Number and Frequency of Worlds

The exact number and frequency of branches are unknown, but it is certainly very often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. The universe branches whenever a quantum system in superposition becomes entangled with its environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. For example, radioactive decays in the human body occur thousands of times per second, and each decay (or non-decay) leads to branching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. Whether the total number of branches is infinite or finite is currently unknown, hinging on deeper understanding of quantum gravity and cosmology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. Regardless, the number is "ginormous" and provides plenty of room for all branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.

### Misconception: "Everything That Could Possibly Happen Happens"

A common [[Theoretical_analyses_and_misconceptions | misconception]] is that [[many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many Worlds]] implies everything that *could* possibly happen *does* happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>. This is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>. The [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]] still obeys the Schrödinger equation, which predicts many potential outcomes but not *every* outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>. For instance, an electron will never convert into a proton because the Schrödinger equation assigns zero probability to events that violate fundamental conservation laws like mass or charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>. However, for events that have a non-zero probability, like a version of an observer becoming president, that specific outcome does happen in a branch, even if it's a "very low amplitude world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.

Carroll draws an analogy to the observable universe: we only see a finite amount of it because light moves at the [[Oneway_speed_of_light_and_its_implications | speed of light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. The universe could be infinitely big, and if so, there would be infinite copies of people doing all sorts of things, completely unrelated to quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>. This inherent largeness of the universe often feels more ridiculous than quantum ideas due to a cognitive bias where people focus on extremely low probability possibilities as if they were significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>.

### Instantaneous vs. Spreading Branching

Another question is whether branching happens instantly across all of space or spreads at the [[Oneway_speed_of_light_and_its_implications | speed of light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>. While different descriptions can be written that make different predictions about how branching spreads, both descriptions yield exactly the same observable predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>. This is because the concept of "branches" or "worlds" is a human convenience for understanding, not an inherent feature built into the fabric of reality itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>. The fundamental reality is simply the [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]] of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. Comparing it to describing air in a room by temperature and pressure rather than listing every molecule's position and velocity, branches are a convenient, albeit incomplete, human description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>.

While the idea of infinite [[possibilities_of_wormholes_and_parallel_universes | parallel universes]] may sound implausible, it arises naturally from the mathematics of quantum mechanics without requiring arbitrary additions like [[wave_particle_duality | wave function]] collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. The [[many_worlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Many Worlds Interpretation]] provides a cleaner and more elegant formalism that is consistent with observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

The world's strongest magnet is located at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Since the year 2000, it has held the Guinness World Record for the strongest continuous magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Magnetic Strength and Comparison

This electromagnet generates a magnetic field of 45 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For context:
*   The Earth's magnetic field is 0.00005 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   A fridge magnet is around 0.01 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   MRI machines can reach up to three Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
The 45 Tesla field is nearly a million times stronger than Earth's magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## [[construction_and_design_of_high_field_magnets | Construction and Design]]

To achieve this extreme field, the magnet is a hybrid design, combining an outer superconducting magnet with an inner resistive magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   The outer superconducting magnet produces 11.5 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Superconducting wire has a limit of around 20 Tesla before it ceases to be superconducting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   The inner resistive magnet produces 33.5 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. By adding these fields, the total is 45 Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

The apparatus itself is two stories tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. However, the maximum field, or "field center," occurs in a narrow cylinder in the middle, specifically in a section about one centimeter tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This small volume is sufficient for experiments with materials like computer chips or cell phone components in material science and kinetic matter research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Bitter Magnets

Making high-field magnets with ordinary resistive wire is challenging due to heat dissipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. Traditional wire-wound magnets are limited to about two Tesla because heat cannot be removed from the innermost windings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. Francis Bitter's innovation in the 1950s involved smashing round wire into thin plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. These plates are stacked with alternating insulators to form a helix, allowing cooling water to be pushed axially through the stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. This design enables much higher currents (up to 57,000 amps) to flow through the coils, generating higher fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   The stack of conductors is aligned with tie rods, placed under 20 tons of force, and then locked down to hold the coil together and provide electrical connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.
*   Several thousand gallons per minute of deionized water are pushed through the coils to prevent them from melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
Material failures can occur when the metal goes past its plastic limit, deforming and potentially shorting to adjacent coils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. One such "expensive failure" destroyed multiple coils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

## Effects on Materials

The magnet's powerful field, including its "fringe field" which extends above and around the magnet, produces various effects on materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Ferromagnetic Materials
As expected, [[magnetic_properties_and_materials | magnetic materials]] are strongly attracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. For example, a Nerf football containing steel washers was visibly pulled towards the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
Ferrofluid, which contains nanoscale magnetite particles suspended in solution, demonstrates strong magnetic effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. In an external magnetic field, these particles line up, causing parallel ridges to form, then spikes on the surface, and eventually causing the ferrofluid to climb the side of its vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:05:08]</a>.
Magnetite, an iron-containing mineral, was the first material from which magnetism was discovered, giving rise to the word "magnet" from its origin in Magnesia, Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
Ferromagnetic materials (like iron, nickel, and cobalt) have unpaired electrons whose magnetic fields align within domains, and these domains can be aligned by a strong external magnetic field to create a permanent magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Conductive, Non-Magnetic Materials (Eddy Currents)
Materials that conduct electricity but are not ferromagnetic behave differently when moving within the magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. As a metal plate falls through the field, the changing magnetic flux induces electric currents, known as eddy currents, in the plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. These eddy currents create their own magnetic field that opposes the change in flux, a phenomenon known as Lenz's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Slowing Dissent:** If a plate falls towards a magnetic pole, induced currents create an opposing pole, causing the plate to be repelled and fall much slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This process dissipates energy as heat, causing the plate to warm up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Movement:** If one tries to lift a plate from the field, a south magnetic pole is induced, attracting it back to the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Pushing it down faster also increases the induced currents and opposing magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Refusal to Roll:** A thick cylinder of aluminum will refuse to roll across the top of the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Projectile Deceleration and Rotation:** When aluminum projectiles are fired from a potato cannon across the magnet's fringe field, the induced eddy currents cause them to rotate and remain oriented along the magnetic field lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. This rotation minimizes the change in flux experienced by the projectile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Projectiles containing coils of wire and LEDs light up as they cross the field, demonstrating the changing induced currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. In all these cases, the induced electric energy is dissipated as light or heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

### Superconductors
Unlike ordinary conductors, superconductors below their critical temperature have zero electrical resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. When a magnet is brought near, currents are induced to oppose the change in flux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Since these currents persist indefinitely, they expel all of the magnetic field (Meissner effect) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
The "human levitator" demonstrates this effect, using a 90-pound (40 kg) magnet hovering above a ring of superconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. When a person stands on the magnet, the increased magnetic flux is opposed by currents in the superconductors, creating a repulsive magnetic field that causes levitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Some non-superconducting filaments in the material trap magnetic field lines, locking the magnet in a stable configuration and allowing it to remain levitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

### [[magnetic_properties_and_materials | Diamagnetic and Paramagnetic Materials]]
All materials possess [[magnetic_properties_and_materials | magnetic properties]], though they are typically only observable in strong magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   **Paramagnetism:** Some materials, like liquid oxygen, are always attracted to magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. The presence of the external field strengthens the material's own magnetic field, leading to attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Diamagnetism:** Most materials are repelled by a strong enough magnetic field, regardless of pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Water is a good example; in an external field, water molecules become opposing magnets and are repelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This repulsion can create an indent on the surface of water when a magnet is brought close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This effect can be used to levitate objects not typically considered magnetic, such as strawberries, raspberries, or even small pieces of plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Living organisms contain enough water that they, too, can be levitated; frogs, grasshoppers, and even mice have been levitated in experiments to simulate weightlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

## Safety and Environmental Impact

The fringe field, though weaker than 45 Tesla, is still dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Objects with shapes will orient themselves to the field, and if they get too close to the 100 Gauss line, they can accelerate rapidly towards the magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Ferromagnetic objects, metallic implants, or pacemakers are strictly prohibited within this line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Camera equipment can also experience havoc due to the magnetic fields, causing bad video or audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

While there are no lasting or long-term effects on living things, strong magnetic fields can polarize stones in the inner ear, causing rodents to spin in circles for a few minutes after being exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

Running these powerful magnets requires substantial energy. The Mag Lab consumes about 8% of Tallahassee's total generating capacity when all four power supplies are at full blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. Their electricity budget is typically $250,000 to $300,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. The lab operates within the city's federally mandated reserve power, allowing the city to generate revenue from power it has to produce but cannot sell, while the lab can quickly ramp down when the city needs the power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

## Purpose and Future

The primary purpose of such strong magnetic fields is to drive material discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This includes:
*   Growing new materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.
*   Placing existing materials in extreme environments like high magnetic fields, high electric fields, high pressure, or ultralow temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.
*   Improving the purity of existing materials by removing impurities, which reduces electron scattering and enhances material properties, enabling the observation of previously unseen phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

[[applications_and_phenomena_related_to_strong_magnetic_fields | Applications and phenomena related to strong magnetic fields]] like these are considered critical for the future, particularly in areas like electric vehicles, which rely on electric motors that require magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This period is seen as an "inflection point" for what can be achieved with this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.
A similar 45 Tesla hybrid magnet has recently been commissioned in China, making it one of two such facilities in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

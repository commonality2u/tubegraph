Aerogel, known for its extraordinary [[properties_of_aerogel | properties]], including its excellent [[aerogel_as_a_thermal_insulator | thermal insulation]] capabilities, is being developed for [[future_developments_and_challenges_for_aerogel | future applications]] in clothing and space technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. While traditional aerogel is naturally [[challenges_of_working_with_brittle_aerogel | brittle]] and can be difficult to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, advancements are making it more usable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Enhancing Aerogel for Practical Applications

To overcome the inherent brittleness of aerogel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, researchers are exploring ways to make it more pliable. One method involves combining silica aerogel particles with a non-flammable binder to create a sticky paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This paste, even in a thin layer, can provide significant [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | thermal insulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, protecting against temperatures as high as nearly 1000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

Aerogels can also be engineered to be either more adsorbent or completely water-impervious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. While normal silica aerogel is hydrophilic and absorbs water readily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, its structure can collapse when wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. To create a water-repellent version, a hydrophobic chemical is used to replace some of the hydroxyl (OH) groups lining the aerogel's internal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Replacing just 30% of these groups makes the aerogel perfectly repel water, allowing it to sit on water for months without degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Advanced Materials for Extreme Environments

Aerogels are being developed from various materials beyond traditional silica, including polymers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. While there is a trade-off between [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | thermal]] and mechanical [[properties_of_aerogel | properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, these new formulations offer different advantages:
*   Traditional silica aerogel has a thermal conductivity of around 15 milliwatts per meter Kelvin, making it 2 to 3 times more insulating than styrofoam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   Polymer aerogels might have slightly higher thermal conductivity (20 to 26 milliwatts per meter Kelvin) but are still 1.5 to 2 times more insulating than styrofoam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   A polyimide aerogel, developed from NASA chemistry, is an excellent insulating material that is non-flammable and feels like wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. It is internally referred to as "Martian tape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## Applications in Clothing and Space Technology

To make aerogel more workable for fabric-like applications, it is being incorporated into composite materials, such as blankets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. A new type of aerogel blanket, made from fiberglass infused with aerogel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, allows for flexing, cutting, sewing, and wrapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This composite material can be used in [[practical_applications_of_aerogel | future apparel]], including astronaut suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

This composite blanket offers tremendous insulation value, with one centimeter providing the same effective insulation as three centimeters of mineral wool or fiberglass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The amorphous silica dust it sheds is safe and easily expelled by the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

In space technology, specialized aerogels are used for maintaining ultra-high vacuums. Zeolite particles can be dispersed throughout aerogel, allowing it to absorb moisture even at very low pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This capability was crucial for the NASA Insight mission's seismometer, which required an exceptional vacuum to prevent motion damping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This aerogel acts as a passive vacuum pump, continuously pulling moisture and other gasses, without requiring any power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This [[future_prospects_of_3d_printing_in_space_exploration | lightweight]], self-sustaining vacuum enabled the Insight mission to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

Measuring extremely large forces with high accuracy is crucial for various applications, such as assessing jet engine thrust or the power of rockets like the Saturn V <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. To achieve this, specialized equipment and meticulous processes are employed to [[measurement_of_large_forces | measure large forces]] and minimize uncertainty.

## The Dead Weight Machine

Rick Seifarth, a physical scientist in the Mass and Force Group, manages a unique dead weight machine designed for precise force measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

*   **Capacity** This machine can apply up to 4,448,222 newtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, which is exactly equivalent to 1,000,000 pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, or 4.45 mega newtons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **World's Largest** Seifarth believes these are the largest mass objects ever calibrated anywhere in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The machine itself is described as the biggest of its type in the world and one of a kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Components** The machine contains twenty 50,000-pound increments of carefully calibrated masses located below ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Calibrating Force Sensors

The machine's primary purpose is to [[calibration_of_force_sensors | calibrate force sensors]], also known as force transducers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

*   **Process** A force transducer is placed on a compression head within the lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. A hydraulic ram in the attic raises a green lifting frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Once the transducer contacts a red loading frame, it begins to lift the weights downstairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. As the lifting frame rises further, more 50,000-pound weights become suspended by the force sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Precision** Because the weights generate an accurately known force, the readouts from the force transducer can be precisely calibrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Field Application** These calibrated devices are then sent into the field, for example, embedded in test stands to monitor forces when rockets are fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This allows for precise control, such as knowing when a rocket reaches "104% of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Achieving Extreme Precision in Mass Measurement

Minimizing uncertainty in force measurement requires extremely precise knowledge of the masses used in the calibration process.

*   **Mass Accuracy** Each 50,000-pound piece of mass is known to approximately 50,036.27 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, with an exact value known to within several American nickels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Each of these pieces is equivalent to ten minivans in mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Calibration Hierarchy** This tiny uncertainty is achieved by referencing the very definition of the kilogram, using K20, the United States fundamental mass standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The process involves gradually working up to larger masses by comparing combinations of known weights (starting with K20) with larger unknown weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. For example, a 5-kilogram mass is compared to two 2s and a 1-kilogram mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Scaling Up** At a certain point, the process converts to pounds, comparing 50-pound masses to 500 pounds, then 2500 pounds, and using a floor scale to reach 10,000, 20,000, and finally 30,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Combinations of these large weights are then used to calibrate the 50,000-pound masses in the dead weight machine's stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Guaranteed Uncertainty** The vertical force vector generated by these weights is sold with an uncertainty of 0.0005%, or five parts per million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This means that at a full one million pounds of applied force, the accuracy is guaranteed to within five pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Environmental Factors

To ensure such low uncertainty, environmental factors are also meticulously accounted for:

*   **Gravitational Acceleration** The gravitational acceleration at the machine's location is slightly less than Earth's standard gravity, requiring an additional 600 pounds to be added to reach the desired force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Buoyant Force** The masses displace 125 pounds of air, so a further 125 pounds must be added to counteract the buoyant force and ensure the full million pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Importance of Minimizing Uncertainty

The existence and operation of such a precise machine underscore the critical need for absolute certainty in physical testing.

*   **Axiom of Testing** "One physical test is worth a thousand expert opinions" is an axiom that has proven itself time and again in the world of physical testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[verification_of_physical_theories | verification of physical theories]] through empirical data.
*   **Safety** When building something like an airplane, accepting even a 10% uncertainty on critical measurements is unacceptable; the uncertainty must be minimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

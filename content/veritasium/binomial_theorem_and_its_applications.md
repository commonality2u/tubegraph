For two millennia, the most effective method for calculating Pi was slow and tedious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, Isaac Newton revolutionized this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> by extending the binomial theorem to [[mathematical_series_expansion | infinite series]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## Understanding Pi

Pi (π) represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It is approximately 3.14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Pi is also related to a circle's area by the formula πR², where R is the radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This formula can be visualized by cutting a circle into thin slices and rearranging them into a rectangle, whose length is half the circumference (πR) and width is the radius (R) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The area of a unit circle (radius 1) is simply Pi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Historical Methods of Calculating Pi

Historically, Pi's value was estimated by inscribing and circumscribing polygons around a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. It was known for thousands of years that Pi must be between three and four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>:
*   An inscribed hexagon with side length one (diameter two) has a perimeter of six, meaning Pi is greater than 6/2, or 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   A circumscribed square (diameter two) has a perimeter of eight, meaning Pi is less than 8/2, or 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Around 250 BC, Archimedes refined this method by bisecting polygons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Starting with a hexagon, he calculated the perimeter of a 12-sided shape (dodecagon), then a 24-gon, 48-gon, and finally a 96-gon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This involved complex calculations of square roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Archimedes achieved a precision for Pi between 3.1408 and 3.1429 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

For the next 2000 years, mathematicians from various cultures, including Chinese, Indian, Persian, and Arab scholars, continued to bisect polygons to dizzying heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   In the late 16th century, Frenchman Francois Viete computed the perimeter of a polygon with 393,216 sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   At the turn of the 17th century, Dutch mathematician Ludolph van Ceulen spent 25 years computing Pi to 35 correct decimal places by using a polygon with 2^62 (over 4 quintillion) sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. These digits were inscribed on his tombstone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   Christoph Grienberger surpassed this record 20 years later, achieving 38 correct decimal places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

This era of polygon bisection ended with the arrival of Sir Isaac Newton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Isaac Newton and the Binomial Theorem

In 1666, at just 23 years old, Newton developed a new method for calculating Pi while quarantining during a bubonic plague outbreak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. He was experimenting with expressions like (1 + X)² and (1 + X)³ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Pascal's Triangle and Binomial Expansion

Newton observed a pattern in the coefficients of these expansions: they correspond to the numbers in Pascal's triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Pascal's triangle, known to ancient Greeks, Indians, Chinese, and Persians, is generated by adding two neighbors in a row to get the value in the row below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This mathematical concept transcends cultures and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

Over time, a general formula, known as the binomial theorem, was developed for the coefficients of (1 + X)^N <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>:
(1 + X)^N = 1 + NX + N(N-1)/2! X² + N(N-1)(N-2)/3! X³ + ... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>

This theorem was rigorously provable and widely known in Newton's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Traditionally, it was applied only when N was a positive integer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, resulting in a finite number of terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Newton's Extension: Breaking the Formula

Newton famously "broke the formula" by applying the binomial theorem where N was *not* a positive integer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. He extended it to negative and fractional powers, leading to [[mathematical_series_expansion | infinite series]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

For example, when N = -1, (1 + X)^-1 = 1/(1 + X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Plugging N = -1 into the binomial formula yields an infinite series with alternating signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>:
1 - X + X² - X³ + X⁴ - X⁵ + ... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>

Newton justified this by showing that multiplying the infinite series by (1 + X) results in 1, proving its validity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This extension meant that Pascal's triangle could be conceptually extended upwards and to include non-integer rows, forming a "continuum of Pascal's triangles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

Newton then explored fractional powers, such as N = 1/2, meaning (1 + X)^(1/2) or √ (1 + X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This also resulted in an [[mathematical_series_expansion | infinite series]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

### Application: Calculating Square Roots

This extended binomial theorem allowed for rapid and efficient calculation of square roots. For instance, to find √3, one could express it as 2 * √ (1 - 1/4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. By plugging X = -1/4 into the series for (1 + X)^(1/2), a rapidly converging series expansion is obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

### Application: Calculating Pi with Calculus

Newton was particularly interested in N = 1/2 because the equation for a unit circle is X² + Y² = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Solving for Y gives the top part of the circle: Y = √ (1 - X²) = (1 - X²)^(1/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This expression is similar to (1 + X)^(1/2), simply requiring X to be replaced by -X² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This yields an [[mathematical_series_expansion | infinite series]] for the circle's shape, where each term is a rational number multiplied by X raised to some power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

To use this for Pi, Newton applied his newly invented calculus (which he called the theory of Fluxions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. He realized that integrating the series for Y from X=0 to X=1 would yield the area of a quarter unit circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Since the area of a unit circle is Pi, the area of a quarter circle is Pi/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

The integration of each term in the series (X^k becomes X^(k+1)/(k+1)) resulted in an infinite series of fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. By evaluating this series at X=1, Newton could calculate Pi to arbitrarily high precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

Newton further refined this by integrating from X=0 to X=1/2 instead of X=0 to X=1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This "final tweak" made the terms of the infinite series decrease in size much faster, as each term would shrink by an additional factor of X², which is 1/4 when X is 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

Integrating to X=1/2 calculates the area of a specific part of the circle, which can be broken down into a 30-degree sector (area Pi/12) and a right triangle (base 1/2, height √3/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This yielded an expression for Pi:
π = 12 * (Integral result - (1/2 * √3/2)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

Using only the first five terms of Newton's series, Pi could be calculated as 3.14161, which is off by only two parts in 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. To match the precision of Ludolph van Ceulen's 35 decimal places, Newton's method would only require computing 50 terms, a task that would take days instead of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

Newton's method rendered the old polygon bisection approach obsolete, marking a fundamental shift in how mathematical constants could be determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. It demonstrated the power of extending mathematical patterns beyond their expected bounds and the profound impact of insight and mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

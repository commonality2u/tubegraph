The development of the world's highest jumping robot, weighing less than a tennis ball, showcases advanced applications of material science in robotic engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This tiny robot can leap 31 meters, exceeding the previous record of 3.7 meters by nearly ten times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This remarkable performance is largely due to its innovative design and the specific materials chosen for its structure.

## Definition of a Jump
For something to qualify as a jump, two criteria must be met:
*   Motion must be initiated by pushing off the ground, excluding devices like quad-copters that push off air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   No mass can be lost during the process, differentiating it from rockets ejecting fuel or arrows launched from a bow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Structural Materials and Properties

The main structure of the robot is engineered to function as an efficient spring, capable of storing and releasing significant amounts of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Carbon Fiber
The robot's core structure consists of four pieces of carbon fiber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Carbon fiber is chosen for its lightweight properties, contributing to the robot's overall mass of just 30 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The entire structure, made of carbon fiber and rubber, doubles as the spring for energy storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Natural Latex Rubber
Elastic bands made from natural latex rubber bind the carbon fiber pieces together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Natural latex rubber is exceptional because it can store more energy per unit mass than almost any other elastic material, specifically 7,000 joules per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Spring Design
The combination of carbon fiber and rubber bands forms a spring with a unique force profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Unlike designs using only rubber bands (where force peaks and decreases) or only carbon fiber slats (where force increases linearly), the hybrid design offers a nearly flat force profile over its entire compression range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This characteristic allows it to store double the energy of a typical spring where force is proportional to displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Researchers assert that this design represents the most efficient spring ever created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Lightweight Design and Energy Storage
The robot's lightweight construction, combining a tiny motor and battery with a structure made of carbon fiber and rubber, is crucial for its high-jumping capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The mechanism uses a small motor that winds a string around an axle, compressing the robot and storing energy in the carbon fiber and rubber bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This gradual energy build-up over a few minutes, known as "work multiplication," allows a small motor to deliver a massive burst of energy upon release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The spring then becomes the limiting factor for jump height, rather than the motor's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Applications
Engineered jumpers like this robot are ideal for exploring other worlds, especially those with thin or non-existent atmospheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. On the moon, with one-sixth of Earth's gravity, this robot could leap 125 meters high and half a kilometer forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. They could navigate challenging terrains like steep cliffs and deep craters, fetching samples for rovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

A fleet of these [[soft_robots_and_their_unique_properties | soft robots]] is being developed, with some capable of righting themselves after landing and others featuring three adjustable legs for steerable jumps in any direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This functionality is enabled by the strategic integration of [[compliant_mechanisms_in_micro_and_macro_engineering | compliant mechanisms]] in their design.

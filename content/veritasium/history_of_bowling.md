Bowling is a sport that has been continually reinvented over thousands of years, evolving up to the present day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It is currently the most popular participatory sport in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Ancient Origins
Bowling is considered an ancient game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Archeologists have discovered wall drawings in an ancient Egyptian tomb, dating back 7,000 years, that depict a sport resembling bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Development in Germany
In Germany, bowling was practiced as a religious ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The pins represented sins, and knocking them all down was seen as a sign of being a good Christian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Martin Luther, a known bowling enthusiast, established the number of pins at nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Arrival in America and the Rise of Ten-Pin
When bowling came to America, nine-pin bowling was prohibited due to its association with gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. To bypass this law, the game of 10-pin bowling was purportedly invented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. In the US today, nine-pin bowling is exclusively played in Texas, as it was the only state that chose to tax it rather than ban it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Evolution of Equipment and Techniques
The sport of bowling has been transformed not only by changes in game rules but also by advancements in equipment and [[professional_bowling_strategies|professional bowling strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

### Lane Technology
Modern bowling lanes are approximately 3.5 feet wide and 60 feet long to the headpin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. While historically made of maple and pinewood, most lanes today are synthetic, composed of fine particles coated with melamine resin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

Oiling the lanes became a significant part of the sport by accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Initially, slip agents and lubricants were applied to protect the wood from damage caused by bowling balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. This protection led to balls skidding and rotating independently of their direction of travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, enabling [[modern_bowling_techniques|hooking]] the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Modern lane machines, costing around $30,000, can precisely apply specific amounts and patterns of oil to each board of the lane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Bowling Ball Design
[[bowling_ball_design_and_technologies|Bowling ball design and technologies]] have undergone significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Early bowling balls were made of hard rubber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. In the mid-1970s, plastic balls like the Columbia Yellow Dot were introduced, followed by urethane bowling balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Subsequently, reactive resin bowling balls became popular, which are modified polyurethane with a porous surface to enhance grip in oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Reactive resin remains the most popular cover stock today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

Initially, bowling balls were perfectly symmetrical spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. House balls in alleys still maintain this design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. However, when holes are drilled, weight is removed from one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. To rebalance, manufacturers added a small pancake weight on the same side as the holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Later, manufacturers began incorporating different weight blocks inside the balls to improve performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Modern balls can look identical externally but roll differently due to internal mass concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, including asymmetric cores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

### Impact on Scores
Technological advancements in bowling have demonstrably improved performance. Over the last two decades, average scores have increased by more than five points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. The number of perfect 300 games per thousand bowlers has significantly risen since the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

*   **1976**: Soaker balls, which were chemically softened to absorb oil and hook more, were banned, leading to a temporary dip in perfect games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.
*   **1976**: The Brunswick LT-48, a new rubber ball, was introduced, contributing to more 300 games in subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.
*   **1991**: The introduction of reactive resin balls marked another significant jump in perfect game frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

While other improvements and natural variability play a role, major shifts in perfect game statistics correlate with the introduction of new bowling ball technology, particularly advancements in ball surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. Even minute factors, such as the color of a ball, can have a small impact, as different pigments absorb oil at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

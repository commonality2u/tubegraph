From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Concrete is an exceptionally important man-made substance, used more than any other substance apart from water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Annually, 500 kilograms of [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]] are produced for every person on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, which can make two cubic meters of [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. [[historical_development_of_concrete | Cementitious material]] (essentially [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]]) is the most abundant solid product we create, matching the combined weight of all other materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. [[historical_development_of_concrete | Concrete]] is essentially liquid rock that can be poured into any shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, and is strong, durable, and inexpensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Historical Development

People have been making a version of [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The earliest form of [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]] was made using limestone, which is calcium carbonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Heating limestone to around 1,000 degrees Celsius drives off CO2, leaving calcium oxide (quicklime) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Grinding quicklime and mixing it with water results in an exothermic reaction, producing calcium hydroxide, which can be poured into a mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Over time, it absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere, turning back into calcium carbonate as water evaporates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Primitive Cement Drawbacks

This primitive [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]] had drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>:
*   Molds could not be very large, as CO2 couldn't penetrate deep enough to harden the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   It would not harden underwater due to the absence of CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Roman Concrete

The Romans found a solution by adding volcanic ash, called pozzolana, to crushed limestone before heating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This created a much stronger and more durable [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. They used it to build structures like the Pantheon, the world's largest unreinforced [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] dome, which has stood for 2,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, and [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] piers into the sea that hardened underwater and still stand today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The secret to Roman [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]]'s incredible strength, durability, and ability to set underwater was the pozzolana, which contained silica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Silica fundamentally changes the [[chemical_composition_and_reactions_in_concrete | chemistry of the cement]], allowing it to harden without drying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Water becomes an integral part of the hardened [[chemical_composition_and_reactions_in_concrete | concrete]], leading to maximum strength when setting underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

A surprising advantage of Roman [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] was its self-healing capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. Due to being less well-mixed than modern [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]], it contained small blocks of undissolved calcium oxide (quicklime) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. If the [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] cracked and water entered, the calcium oxide would dissolve to form calcium hydroxide, leading to new growth of calcium carbonate, effectively repairing the crack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

## Modern Concrete

### Portland Cement

For centuries, the Roman recipe was lost, only to be rediscovered in the 1400s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Modern [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] primarily uses a [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]] formulation known as Portland [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]], discovered in the 1840s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The name "Portland" was a marketing term, claiming the [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]]'s gray color resembled desirable rocks quarried near Portland, England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

Portland [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]] is made by crushing limestone and mixing it with shale or clay to provide silicates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This mixture is ground into a fine powder and heated in a kiln to very high temperatures, producing hard nodules called clinker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. While earlier [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]] chemists might have produced clinker accidentally and considered it waste, grinding it down yields a [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]] superior to other chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

The most common compound in Portland [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]] is tricalcium silicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### Concrete Production and Testing

To make [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]], [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]] powder is combined with aggregates (sand and gravel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. These aggregates are blasted from quarries, then ground to specific sizes and shapes, as these characteristics affect the final strength of the [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Well-rounded, spherical sand (like river sand) is preferred for better finishability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Lightweight aggregates can be incorporated to reduce the weight of [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]], from a typical 150 pounds per cubic foot to about 110 pounds per cubic foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

Aggregates are transported to [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] plants, stored, and then precisely weighed out into mixer trucks according to a specific recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Every component, including rocks, sand, and [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]], is weighed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

[[historical_development_of_concrete | Concrete]] suppliers cast sample cylinders from the material poured on a job site to test its strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. These samples are cured in a 100% humidity environment, often submerged in a lime bath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Samples are tested at 7, 14, and 28 days, with full strength typically reached at 28 days, though strengthening continues thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The tests are performed using a hydraulic press, applying pressure until the cylinder fails, with a target loading rate of around 30 psi per second to avoid shocking the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Hardening Process (Cement Hydration)

The hardening of [[chemical_composition_and_reactions_in_concrete | concrete]] begins when water is added to the dry mixture of gravel, sand, and [[chemical_composition_and_reactions_in_concrete | cement]] powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Water dissolves the [[chemical_composition_and_reactions_in_concrete | cement]] powder grains, releasing ions into solution, including calcium hydroxide, which makes the solution very basic (pH up to 12 or 13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. As tricalcium silicate (the most common compound in [[chemical_composition_and_reactions_in_concrete | cement]]) reacts with water, crystals of calcium silicate hydrates and other hydrate minerals form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. These crystals grow and interlock, causing the [[chemical_composition_and_reactions_in_concrete | concrete]] to harden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. This process is called [[chemical_composition_and_reactions_in_concrete | cement hydration]], and the water becomes an integral part of the solid [[chemical_composition_and_reactions_in_concrete | concrete]] material; it does not evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Freshly poured [[chemical_composition_and_reactions_in_concrete | concrete]] should be kept in a damp environment to facilitate this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

### Consistency and Setting Time

The consistency of [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. While water can adjust consistency, it can also affect strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Modern chemicals like superplasticizers are used to make [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] easier to work and spread without significantly changing water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Consistency is checked using a slump or spread test, where a cone of [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] is filled, lifted, and the spread distance is measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

[[historical_development_of_concrete | Concrete]] typically begins to harden after about four hours without agitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. This is why [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] trucks rotate their drums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. If [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] hardens inside a drum due to breakdowns or traffic, adding sugar (e.g., from soda) can temporarily slow down the setting process, buying a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

| **Durability**     | Known for exceptional durability, with structures lasting 2,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.                                                                                                                            | Designed for specific strength and durability, tested to 28-day full strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Self-Healing**   | Yes, due to undissolved quicklime that reacts with water in cracks to form new calcium carbonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.                                                                                             | No inherent self-healing property of this type described.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

While Roman [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] had surprising advantages like self-healing, it's generally not considered superior to modern [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. There is a survivor bias, as only the most durable Roman structures remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Modern practices prioritize cost-effectiveness; stronger, longer-lasting [[historical_development_of_concrete | concretes]] could be made, but are not chosen due to expense and typical building lifespan expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

## Environmental Impact

Despite its utility, [[environmental_impact_and_carbon_footprint_of_concrete_production | concrete]] production accounts for an estimated 8% of the global total CO2 emissions, exceeding the entire aviation sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. This is a significant environmental concern.

## Origin of Materials

The core component of [[historical_development_of_concrete | cement]] and [[historical_development_of_concrete | concrete]], limestone, originates from the skeletons and shells of ancient sea organisms that died millions of years ago and were then compressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Therefore, modern skyscrapers and infrastructure are fundamentally built from ancient marine life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

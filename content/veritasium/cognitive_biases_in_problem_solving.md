Problem-solving often reveals inherent cognitive biases, particularly the tendency to seek information that confirms existing beliefs rather than attempting to disprove them. This phenomenon was illustrated through a three-number sequence puzzle designed to highlight this bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## The Three-Number Sequence Puzzle

Participants were given an initial sequence of numbers (2, 4, 8) that obeyed a hidden rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Their task was to discover this rule by proposing their own three-number sequences. The presenter would then indicate whether the proposed sequence followed the rule ("yes") or not ("no") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Initial Approaches and Hypotheses

Most participants, upon hearing "2, 4, 8," quickly formed an initial hypothesis, such as "multiply by 2" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. They then proposed sequences that confirmed this hypothesis, like "16, 32, 64" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, "3, 6, 12" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, "10, 20, 40" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, or "5, 10, 20" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. All of these sequences, despite fitting the "multiply by 2" pattern, consistently followed the actual hidden rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, "multiply by 2" was explicitly stated as *not* the presenter's rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The presenter observed that this was a common approach: "You're approaching the way most people approach it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Participants sought information that would confirm their current belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### The Actual Rule and the "No" Answer

The key to discovering the true rule lay in proposing sequences that might *not* fit the participant's current hypothesis, or even the actual rule, in order to gather more comprehensive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. When a participant finally proposed "10, 9, 8," this sequence did *not* follow the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This "no" response provided crucial information, leading to the correct deduction: the rule was simply that the numbers had to be in **increasing order** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, also referred to as "ascending order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Examples that fit this rule included "2, 4, 7" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, "3, 6, 9" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, "1, 2, 3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, and "7, 8, 9" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Connecting to Cognitive Biases and the Scientific Method

The presenter noted that participants consistently proposed sequences they expected to result in a "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This approach is less effective for gaining information; instead, seeking "no" answers is "much more informational" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This concept is central to understanding [[confirmation_bias_and_its_effects|confirmation bias]], where individuals tend to favor information that confirms their existing beliefs.

The exercise was inspired by Nassim Taleb's book *The Black Swan* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The black swan metaphor illustrates "the unknown and the unexpected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Historically, the theory was that all swans were white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Every observation of a white swan seemed to confirm this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. However, the discovery of black swans in Australia disproved the theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This highlights a critical principle: one can never definitively prove a theory true, but a single counter-example can prove it false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

This approach is fundamental to the scientific method:
> "We set out to disprove our theories and it's when can't disprove them that we say this must be getting at something really true about our reality." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>

To genuinely understand the truth and avoid self-deception, one should actively try to disprove what they believe to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

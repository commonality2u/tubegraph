[[swimming_in_shade_balls | Swimming in shade balls]] presents significant challenges, particularly when multiple layers are present. While a single layer of [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] allows for some movement, multi-layer configurations drastically increase resistance and change the dynamics of [[swimming_in_shade_balls | swimming]].

## Initial Observations and Dangers

The manufacturer of [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] explicitly advises against [[swimming_in_shade_balls | swimming in them]], citing potential danger and regularly refusing requests from residential customers for this reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This warning stems from the unique properties of [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]]: they are half-full of water, making them inherently heavy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. For instance, 1,200 [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] weigh approximately 300 kilograms (660 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Attempts to Traverse the Surface

With multiple layers of [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]], it appears possible to float on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. However, attempts to run or slide across the surface proved to be "doomed to failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Each individual [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade ball]], when fully submerged, supports only about 300 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. To entirely support a person's body above the water, more than 260 [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | shade balls]] would need to be trapped directly underneath them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

It is possible to float on the surface if completely still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. However, any movement causes the balls to shift, leading to a sensation akin to quicksand where one sinks deeper into the layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## Swimming in Multi-Layer Shade Balls

[[impact_of_shade_balls_on_swimming_dynamics | Swimming in multi-layer shade balls]] is significantly more difficult than in a single layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. While some unorthodox styles, primarily swimming beneath the balls, might allow for minimal forward motion, traditional strokes are largely ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. As one swimmer noted, "I was [[swimming_in_shade_balls | swimming]], I don't say good, and I just couldn't like go anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

The core reason for this increased difficulty lies in the interaction between the balls:
*   Unlike in a single layer where balls can move past each other, multiple layers cause the balls to trap against one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   This trapping makes the mass of [[design_and_material_considerations_for_shade_balls | balls]] act more like a solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   The result is a "significantly more resistance" to movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

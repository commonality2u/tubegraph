*2010, Odyssey Two* is a sequel to *2001, A Space Odyssey*, penned by Arthur C. Clarke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Plot and Significance
At the conclusion of the novel, an alien intelligence transforms Jupiter into a star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. As astronauts manage a narrow escape from the implosion, they receive a message from the aliens:
> "All these worlds are yours, except Europa, attempt no landing there." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>

Despite being a work of fiction, this novel, published in 1982, highlighted the early suspicion that Europa presented the most promising opportunity to discover alien life within our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Clarke's Approval for Europa Missions
During a Europa Ocean Conference in the late 1990s, NASA initiated a video call with Arthur C. Clarke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Following a presentation of their future mission plans to explore the distant ocean world, Clarke granted NASA his permission to land on Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

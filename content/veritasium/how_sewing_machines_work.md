A sewing machine is a device that creates stitches by rapidly moving a needle up and down, leaving a trail of stitches behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Unlike hand sewing where a needle must be passed fully through the fabric, released, and grabbed on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, sewing machines operate on a fundamentally different principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The invention of the sewing machine required a completely new method of sewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Virtually every piece of clothing worn today was made by a sewing machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. These machines perform "tiny mechanical miracles" every second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Challenge of Hand Sewing Mechanization

Hand sewing, typically using a running stitch, involves weaving a needle back and forth through fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The major obstacle to mechanizing any hand stitch is that the needle must be released on one side of the fabric and picked up again on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This action was almost impossible for machines 200 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Humans have been sewing clothes for tens of thousands of years; a 50,000-year-old bone needle found in Siberia suggests sewing is a fundamental human activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Historically, needles have remained largely unchanged for millennia, featuring a sharp end and an eye for thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Breakthroughs in Sewing Machine Technology

The development of the sewing machine came through three key breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### 1. The Eye-Point Needle

In 1755, German inventor Charles Frederick Wiesenthal patented a needle that was sharp on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This allowed the needle to pass back and forth through fabric without being flipped over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. An unexpected benefit of this design was moving the eye of the needle next to the sharp tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This innovation was crucial because it enabled the thread to stay below the fabric while the needle was pulled out, preventing the thread from being completely withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The eye-point needle is used by all sewing machines today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### 2. Securing the Thread (Stitch Types)

To prevent the thread from pulling out, a method was needed to tangle or secure it at the bottom of the stitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Two primary ways of doing this were developed:

#### Chain Stitch

The chain stitch involves keeping a loop of thread underneath the fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. As the needle pulls out, the fabric is moved over, and the needle passes through the previously formed loop, creating a linked chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This was one of the first stitch types successfully performed by sewing machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

**Early Inventors and Challenges:**
It is difficult to pinpoint the exact inventor of the first sewing machine due to multiple concurrent efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>:
*   **Thomas Saint** (1790) drew detailed patent drawings but likely never built a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Joseph Madersperger** (1814) received a patent in Vienna and built a machine after a decade, but it was never commercialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Barth√©lemy Thimonnier** (1830) built a version creating a chain stitch with a barb needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. He set up a factory manufacturing French army uniforms, but a mob of tailors destroyed his machines due to job fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

**Commercial Viability and Mechanism Refinements:**
Sewing machines became commercially viable decades later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. James Gibbs and Charles Raymond independently invented reliable chain stitch machines in 1857 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

*   **Charles Raymond's design** used a hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. As the needle descends, it carries the thread. When the needle moves up, the thread between the eye and fabric shortens and buckles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. At this precise moment, a sharp hook catches the bulge, stretching it into a loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. As the needle returns, the hook moves back, and the needle passes through this loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **James Gibbs' design** was similar but featured a rotating hook (looper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. As the needle lowers, the rotating hook grabs the thread, spins around, releases the first loop, and then grabs the next loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Gibbs developed 37 wooden prototypes to perfect the looper's shape, a design used in over 80 models of sewing machines for 80 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The looper was held tightly enough to prevent it from falling out, but with a gap for the thread to pass through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

**Limitations of Chain Stitch:**
A simple chain stitch has a flaw: if the thread comes loose, all the stitching can easily be pulled out due to minimal friction with the fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. More complex, robust chain stitches were developed, and they are often found holding the hem of jeans or used for embroidery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

#### Lock Stitch

The lock stitch uses two separate spools of thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>: a top thread from the needle and a bottom thread from a bobbin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The needle goes through the fabric, creating a loop with the top thread, and then the bobbin thread passes completely through this loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. When the needle pulls back up, the two pieces of thread are interlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

**Key Inventors and Mechanisms:**
*   **Elias Howe** patented the lock stitch in 1846 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. He demonstrated its efficiency by racing his machine against five seamstresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Howe's initial machine used a curved needle and could only sew in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Allen B. Wilson** significantly improved the lock stitch sewing machine, receiving patents in 1850 and 1851 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
    *   His 1850 patent was for the **vibrating shuttle lock stitch machine** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The shuttle oscillates back and forth, containing a small bobbin of thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. It catches the top thread loop from the needle and passes through it, intertwining the two threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The shuttle's movement is synchronized with the needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Millions of Singer Model 27 machines, using this design, were made and are still functional over a century later due to their robust construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
    *   His 1851 patent is the basis for most modern sewing machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Instead of a shuttle, the bobbin is inside a **rotating hook** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The needle pulls the top thread down, then slightly up to create a bulge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. The rotating hook grabs this bulge, pulling more thread to pass entirely around the bobbin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. The needle then pops back up, forming the stitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

**Thread Tension and Needle Groove:**
For a strong lock stitch, the tension on both the top and bottom threads must be identical so that the stitch meets perfectly in the middle of the fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. A groove in the sewing needle was developed to reduce friction between the thread and the fabric as the thread is pulled down around the bobbin and then tensioned again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This innovation reduced fraying and resulted in cleaner stitches, and practically all modern sewing machine needles have this groove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

### 3. Fabric Movement (Feed Dogs)

Early sewing machines required the fabric to be moved by hand after each stitch, which was slow and resulted in unevenly spaced stitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. [[Allen B. Wilson]] again provided the most successful solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

His design, called **feed dogs**, consists of a small piece of metal with grooves that pushes up from below the fabric when the needle is not in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. It grabs the fabric and moves it a fraction of an inch to position it for the next stitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This design is used in nearly all modern sewing machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

A modified version, the universal feed machine, used for [[Design and production of compliant mechanisms | chain stitch embroidery]], employs a handle to rotate the machine's nose, allowing the presser foot to advance the fabric 360 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## Impact of Sewing Machines

While Isaac Singer is the most famous name associated with sewing machines, he did not invent it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Singer was a shrewd businessman who acquired patents for various parts and optimized the production process, inspired by interchangeable parts in firearm manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. His company dramatically reduced the price of sewing machines from $100 to around $10 (approximately $300 in 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. This lower price allowed machines to be sold to families, not just corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Singer's company was also one of the first in the world to offer installment payment plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, becoming one of the largest and first American multinational corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

The [[Impact of sewing machines on clothing production | impact of sewing machines on clothing production]] was profound:
*   Before their advent, sewing a single shirt took over 12 hours; it now takes less than 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   In 1900, the average American family spent about 15% of its income on clothing; by 2003, it was less than 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   Despite spending less, people own more clothes; in 2019, the worldwide average was over 130 garments per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   Annually, 100 billion garments are produced globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. In the US alone, 11.3 million tons of clothing end up in landfills each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

The sewing machine is considered brilliant, iterated upon, and improved by dozens of people, having revolutionized the world by inventing a completely new way to sew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Egocentric bias is a cognitive phenomenon where individuals overestimate their own contributions and importance in various situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This bias leads most people to believe they do the majority of the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Manifestations of Egocentric Bias

Egocentric bias is observed in several contexts:

*   **Academic Work**: When authors of multi-author papers are asked to estimate their personal percentage of work, the combined total often averages 140% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Household Chores**: Couples estimating their share of housework almost always report a combined total exceeding 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Negative Contributions**: This bias is not limited to positive contributions. When couples are asked what fraction of fights they start or how much of the mess is theirs, the total again exceeds 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This indicates the bias is not simply about wanting to appear more helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Underlying Cause

The primary reason for egocentric bias is that individuals vividly experience and remember all of their own actions, but not everything everyone else does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This natural overestimation of personal contributions leads to an underestimation of others' contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Impact on Perceiving Luck

Egocentric bias also causes individuals to underestimate the influence of external factors, such as the role luck plays in their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. People often largely remain oblivious to the fortunate events that support their achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Examples of Overlooking Luck

*   **Hockey Players**: Professional hockey players might attribute their NHL success to hard work, determination, or great coaches, but rarely to being born early in the year, which significantly increases their chances due to league cut-off dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Country of Birth**: Being born into a prosperous country is a significant factor in an individual's potential income, explaining about half the variance in global income, yet this is rarely acknowledged as luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### [[psychological_effects_of_acknowledging_or_ignoring_luck | Psychological Effects of Ignoring Luck]]

Ignoring or downplaying the importance of chance events can have several psychological and societal effects:

*   **Increased Perceived Success Probability**: A useful delusion is to believe one is in full control of their destiny, as perceiving an outcome as uncertain can decrease effort and chances of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Justification of Status and Inequality**: Overlooking lucky breaks makes it easier to justify one's place in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Individuals with wealth or power may attribute their success solely to intelligence, effort, and perseverance, making it easier to accept inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   In an experiment, randomly designated team leaders in a discussion group, despite no special aptitude or responsibility, consistently took an extra cookie provided to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This suggests that once status is achieved, a feeling of deservingness naturally follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Research indicates that people who attribute good outcomes to their personal qualities are less generous, contributing 25% less to charity than those who list external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **[[Perception of reality and philosophical implications | Distorted View of Reality]]**: Leaders and successful individuals, often unaware of their own luck, may develop a [[Perception of reality and philosophical implications | distorted view of reality]] akin to survivor bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Their experience, where hard work led to success, can lead them to believe the world is inherently fair and that less successful people are simply less talented or hardworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This perspective can make them less inclined to be generous and less likely to contribute to the societal structures that enabled their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Benefits of Acknowledging Luck

Acknowledging fortunate circumstances not only aligns one more closely with reality but also offers other advantages:

*   **Increased Likeability**: Individuals who acknowledge luck in their success are perceived as kinder and more approachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Gratitude and Happiness**: Raising awareness of fortunate events can foster gratitude and lead to greater happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Paradoxical Advice for Success

To navigate the world effectively, a paradoxical approach is suggested:
1.  **Believe in complete control**: For motivation and effort, it's beneficial to believe that success is solely due to one's talent and hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
2.  **Acknowledge luck's role**: Simultaneously, understand that this belief is not entirely true for oneself or others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. If success is achieved, remember that luck played a significant role and strive to increase the luck of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

The [[Einsteins synchronization convention | Einstein synchronization convention]] is a fundamental principle in physics that defines how clocks at different locations are synchronized. It asserts that the one-way speed of light is the same in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. This concept was introduced by [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Albert Einstein]] in his famous 1905 paper, "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

## The Challenge of Measuring One-Way Speed of Light

The speed of light is officially defined as exactly 299,792,458 meters per second, a value that has been used to define the length of a meter since 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. However, this accepted value refers to the "round-trip" or "two-way" speed of light, not the "one-way" speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

Measuring the speed of light in one direction presents a unique challenge:
*   **Need for Synchronized Clocks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>: To measure the one-way speed of light, one would need two clocks, one at the starting point and one at the end point, precisely synchronized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Synchronization Dilemma** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>:
    *   Connecting clocks with a wire to send a pulse would result in a time delay equal to the time light takes to travel that distance, which is precisely what is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
    *   Synchronizing clocks together and then moving one to a distant location would lead to time dilation due to [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | special relativity]], meaning the clocks would no longer be in sync upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
    *   Even moving clocks very slowly to minimize time dilation doesn't resolve the issue, as time dilation itself depends on the unknown one-way speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

Historically, the first experimental measurement of the speed of light, performed by [[Historical accounts of synchronization in engineering and physics | Hippolyte Fizeau]] in 1849, involved a round trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Fizeau used a rapidly spinning gear and a mirror to measure the time for light to travel a two-way path of eight kilometers, yielding a result within 5% of the accepted value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This highlights that all experimental measurements of light speed have inherently been two-way measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

## Einstein's Stipulation

Faced with the inability to experimentally measure the one-way speed of light without already knowing it, [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Einstein]] addressed the problem of synchronizing clocks at different locations (A and B) in his 1905 paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. He stated that "there is no way that we can meaningfully compare the times they measure unless we established by definition that the time required by light to travel from A to B equals the time it requires to travel from B to A" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

This means [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | Einstein]] essentially *defined* the one-way speed of light to be the same in opposite directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. He emphasized that this was a "stipulation that I can make of my own free will to arrive at a definition of simultaneity," rather than a physical hypothesis or supposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. This convention ensures that the definition of simultaneity (what "right now" means at a distance) is consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

## Implications and Unknowability

The consequence of this convention is that while the two-way speed of light is certainly `c` (the speed of light), the one-way speed of light is, in a strict experimental sense, unknowable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>.

Consider the hypothetical scenario where the speed of light from Earth to Mars is `c/2` and instantaneous on the return journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>. If communicators on Earth and Mars use the [[Einsteins synchronization convention | Einstein synchronization convention]], they would assume signals take equal time (e.g., 10 minutes out, 10 minutes back for a 20-minute round trip) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. However, under this hypothetical scenario, the clocks would be out of sync by 10 minutes, and there would be no way for them to detect or correct this error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Practical Impact
> Modern technologies like GPS rely on the assumption that the speed of light is the same in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. If the one-way speed of light were different, the GPS system, *based on its internal assumptions*, would still yield results consistent with a constant `c`, even if light were traveling at different speeds in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

### The Problem of Simultaneity
The flexibility in defining the one-way speed of light directly impacts the concept of simultaneity across different locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. The [[Einsteins synchronization convention | Einstein convention]] chooses a uniform one-way speed of light, but from an experimental standpoint, other conventions (as long as the round trip works out to `c`) are equally valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>. This leads to profound questions:
*   Does the one-way speed of light even have a well-defined value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>?
*   What does this mean for the concept of simultaneity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>?
*   Does it make sense to talk about events happening "at the same time" if they are separated by distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>?

This debate has continued since 1905 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>. While most physicists accept the convention for its simplicity (appealing to Occam's razor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>, it remains important to acknowledge that it is a convention, not an empirically verified fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. This "hidden" aspect of the universe may even offer a clue for future advancements in physics, connecting [[Einsteins general theory of relativity | General Relativity]], Quantum Mechanics, space, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

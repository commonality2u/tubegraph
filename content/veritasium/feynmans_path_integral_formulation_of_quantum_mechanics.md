From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Richard Feynman's path integral formulation of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanics]] posits that when a particle or object moves from one point to another, it explores all possible paths simultaneously. This contrasts with the classical understanding that objects follow a single, defined trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, a belief the narrator admits was a significant [[misconceptions_in_classical_paths_versus_quantum_paths | misconception]] for most of their life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The apparent single, well-defined trajectories seen in everyday life are described as "the most convincing illusion nature has ever devised" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## The Classical Principle of Least Time

The concept that objects "know" which path to take is not new. For instance, light traveling from one medium to another follows a path that minimizes its journey time, a phenomenon mathematically akin to someone choosing the fastest route to save a friend at a beach by balancing running speed on sand and swimming speed in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Classically, this behavior was often explained by local interactions; light would set off, encounter a new medium, and change direction due to those interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. However, this raises the question of how light "knows" to minimize its travel time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Feynman's formulation offers a deeper explanation: light, electrons, protons, and all [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum particles]] truly explore all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## The Role of Action in Quantum Mechanics

The understanding of why objects appear to follow single paths, despite exploring all possibilities, is rooted in a quantity known as "action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Historical Development of Action
*   **Maupertuis's Proposal**: The concept of action was first proposed by Maupertuis, who ad hoc defined it as "mass times velocity times distance" and claimed that everything follows the path that minimizes this quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Hamilton's Formulation**: Hamilton later showed that action is equivalent to the integral over time of kinetic energy minus potential energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:03:03]</a>. This concept became a useful alternative for solving physics problems, especially when [[applications_of_maxwells_equations_in_analyzing_circuits | Newton's laws]] became cumbersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Action and the Birth of Quantum Mechanics
Around the turn of the 20th century, action became central to the birth of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

*   **Blackbody Radiation**: The problem of blackbody radiation, particularly how much visible light a hot filament emits, puzzled scientists in Germany in the 1890s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Theoretical attempts, like the Rayleigh-Jeans law based on classical physics, predicted an "ultraviolet catastrophe" – an infinite amount of energy emitted at the shortest wavelengths – which contradicted experimental data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Planck's Quantum Hypothesis**: Max Planck solved this problem in an "act of desperation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. He proposed that energy could only be emitted in discrete packets, or "quanta," with the energy of one quantum directly proportional to its frequency (E = hf), where 'h' is [[the_role_of_plancks_constant_in_quantum_mechanics | Planck's constant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This restriction on energy explained why fewer atoms could emit higher frequencies at a given temperature, preventing the ultraviolet catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Planck later determined that 'h' had the units of action and was a "quantum of action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Einstein and Photons**: Albert Einstein reinforced Planck's theory in 1905, asserting that light truly consists of discrete packets called photons, each with energy 'hf'. This explained the photoelectric effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Bohr and Quantized Angular Momentum**: Niels Bohr, trying to understand atomic stability, noticed that angular momentum has the same units as action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. He then discretized the electron's orbital angular momentum in multiples of `h/2π` (or `ħ`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This seemingly arbitrary quantization correctly predicted the energy levels and spectrum of the hydrogen atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **[[De_Broglies_hypothesis_and_waveparticle_duality | De Broglie's Hypothesis]]**: In 1924, Louis de Broglie provided a physical reason for Bohr's quantization. He proposed that if light could be both a wave and a particle ([[wave_particle_duality | wave-particle duality]]), then matter particles could also be waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. He defined a particle's wavelength as [[the_role_of_plancks_constant_in_quantum_mechanics | Planck's constant]] divided by its momentum (λ = h/mv) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. For an electron to be bound in an atom, it must exist as a standing wave, meaning a whole number of wavelengths must fit around the orbit's circumference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:07]</a>. This condition mathematically reproduced Bohr's quantized angular momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:51]</a>, giving a physical basis for quantization: electrons are waves that form stable standing waves in atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:56]</a>.

## Feynman's Path Integral and Interference
The wave nature of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum objects]] implies they do not have a single path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This is illustrated by the double-slit experiment: if one cannot know which slit a particle goes through, it must be considered to go through both simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:58]</a>. The probability of finding a particle at a point on the screen is found by adding the amplitudes of the waves from each slit and squaring the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:05]</a>.

Feynman's insight, often explained through a thought experiment attributed to him, extends this: if the double-slit experiment implies traversing two paths, then infinite slits (effectively removing the screen) and infinite screens imply that a particle traveling through empty space must also be exploring all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:17:22]</a>. This includes paths that are seemingly impossible, such as those going faster than light, backward in time, or even to the moon and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:09]</a>.

### How Paths are Combined
According to Feynman, every possible path contributes to the final outcome. Each path is associated with an "arrow" (a complex amplitude) whose direction rotates based on the path's action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Specifically, the phase (angle) of this arrow is determined by the action of the path, divided by [[the_role_of_plancks_constant_in_quantum_mechanics | Planck's constant]] (specifically, h-bar, `ħ`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:31]</a>.

*   **Phase and Action**: As a particle wave follows a path, its phase increases, causing the vector (arrow) to wind around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:05]</a>. The total change in phase for a path is the integral over time of (kinetic energy minus potential energy), which is precisely the classical action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:27]</a>. Thus, action determines how fast the phase changes along a path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:33]</a>.
*   **Destructive and Constructive Interference**:
    *   Since [[the_role_of_plancks_constant_in_quantum_mechanics | Planck's constant]] (`ħ`) is extremely tiny (approx. 10^-34 joule-seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:46]</a>, the action of everyday objects on ordinary paths is vastly larger, causing their phases to spin around zillions of times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:58]</a>.
    *   For most "crazy" paths, even a slight difference in action results in the arrow pointing in a random direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:07]</a>. When all these randomly oriented arrows are summed, they largely cancel each other out through destructive interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:32]</a>.
    *   The crucial exception is for paths closest to the [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | path of least action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:38]</a>. At a minimum, tiny changes to the path do not change the action to first order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:46]</a>. Therefore, paths very close to the path of least action have arrows that point in roughly the same direction, leading to constructive interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:57]</a>. These constructively interfering paths are the ones we observe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:25:03]</a>.

## Emergence of Classical Mechanics
This mechanism explains how [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | classical mechanics]] emerges from [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:28]</a>. A ball or a planet does not have a precise trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:36]</a>; instead, everything explores all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:40]</a>. Massive particles have large actions compared to `ħ`, so only paths extremely close to the true path of least action survive due to constructive interference, making them appear "particle-like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:49]</a>. For smaller particles like electrons or photons, actions are smaller, allowing for a wider spread of trajectories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:58]</a>.

### Experimental Demonstration
The concept is demonstrated by a modified reflection experiment. Normally, light reflects at an angle of incidence equal to the angle of reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:27:00]</a>. According to Feynman, other paths exist but destructively interfere. By covering a mirror with a diffraction grating (about 1,000 lines per millimeter), which selectively blocks certain parts of the mirror, the destructive interference can be partially removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:46]</a>. This allows light to reflect in "weird" directions where it would normally not, by allowing the arrows for those paths to constructively interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:28:13]</a>. This also works when shining a laser *next* to the grating, showing that light *does* explore paths that don't directly hit the mirror, but these paths normally cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:22]</a>.

## Action as a Fundamental Principle
Theoretical physicists often discuss action rather than energy or forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:45]</a>. The [[principle_of_least_action_in_classical_and_quantum_mechanics | principle of least action]] provides a single mathematical framework that can be applied across different areas of physics, from classical mechanics to [[general_relativity_equations | general relativity]] and electrodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:25]</a>. The current hunt for a "theory of everything" in physics is essentially a search for the correct Lagrangian (a function from which action is derived) that can generate all the known laws of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:41]</a>.

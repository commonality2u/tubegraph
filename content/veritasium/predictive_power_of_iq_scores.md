From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

The term IQ is prevalent in popular culture, often understood as an objective and rigorous measurement of intellectual ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. While there are many online IQ tests, their accuracy is often questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Despite the common understanding and debates surrounding it, the core question remains: What can IQ predict about one's life? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

## Origins and Measurement
The concept of intelligence testing dates back hundreds of years, with a significant breakthrough in 1904 by English psychologist Charles Spearman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Spearman observed a positive correlation (0.64) between students' grades in different subjects like Math and English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. To explain this, he proposed the existence of a "general intelligence" or [[what_iq_tests_measure | g-factor]], which captures how quickly students learn new material, recognize patterns, and think critically across subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. He also suggested "s-factors" for subject-specific abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Around the same time, Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon developed the Binet-Simon test in France to identify students needing additional academic support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This test assigned a "mental age" based on performance relative to other age groups, leading to the calculation of an "intelligence quotient" (IQ) by dividing mental age by actual age and multiplying by 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Later, Lewis Terman standardized it into the Stanford-Binet test in the U.S., which became widely used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Modern IQ tests aim to measure the [[what_iq_tests_measure | g-factor]] by assessing diverse mental abilities, including memory, verbal, spatial, and numerical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Raw scores are normalized so that the mean IQ is 100 and the standard deviation is 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Approximately 68% of people have an IQ between 85 and 115, while only about 2% score above 130 or below 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Predictions Based on IQ

IQ scores, derived from a few hours of questions, correlate with various life outcomes:

### Brain Size
A meta-analysis from 2005 estimated a correlation of 0.33 between IQ and brain size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

### School Success and Completion
IQ is a strong predictor of academic achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. A 2007 Scottish study found a correlation of 0.8 between the IQs of 11-year-olds and their national school examination results five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This means about two-thirds of the variation in exam scores could be predicted by IQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. IQ also predicts the level of schooling a person will complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Standardized tests like the SAT, ACT, and GRE are argued to be essentially IQ tests, correlating with them at around 0.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### Job Success
IQ is a robust predictor of job success, particularly in technical or high-complexity roles, with correlations typically ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The U.S. military, for example, does not accept recruits with an IQ under 80 and limits the number of recruits between 81 and 92 IQ points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. During the Vietnam War, relaxing these requirements led to recruits below the threshold being 1.5 to 3 times more likely to fail training and requiring 3 to 9 times more remedial training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### Longevity
A Scottish study found that for every 15-point increase in IQ at age 11, individuals were 27% more likely to be alive at age 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. A large meta-analysis supports that higher IQs correlate with a lower risk of mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

### Income and Net Worth
A study showed a tendency for income to increase with IQ, finding a correlation coefficient of 0.3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. However, a meta-analysis of 31 studies found a smaller correlation of 0.21 between IQ and income, meaning only 4.4% of income variance is explained by IQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The relationship with net worth is even weaker, showing almost no correlation with IQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This suggests that high IQ or higher average income does not necessarily translate to greater savings or wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

## [[controversies_and_misconceptions_about_iq | Controversies and Misconceptions]] Affecting Predictive Power

### Fixed vs. Malleable Intelligence
Early researchers, like Spearman, believed [[what_iq_tests_measure | g-factor]] was fixed and unchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. While IQ scores show consistency over a lifetime (correlation of 0.5 to 0.6 over 80 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, it is not entirely determined by genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Studies indicate that [[factors_influencing_iq_scores | both genetics and environment]] contribute, with heredity estimates ranging from 40% to 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. Education, in particular, can improve IQ, making it not completely fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

### The Flynn Effect
Researcher James Flynn observed that average IQ scores have been increasing by about 2-3 points per decade over the past century, known as the Flynn Effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. This significant increase (around 30 points) cannot be attributed to genetic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. Possible causes include:
*   Improved childhood nutrition and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.
*   Better education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
*   A societal shift from manual labor to more abstract thinking in common work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

### Cultural Bias in Testing
IQ tests do not objectively measure intelligence independent of cultural context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. Even "culture fair" tests that use visual and geometric patterns are influenced by cultural differences in language and perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. They do not assess forms of intelligence vital in other cultures, such as ethnobotanical knowledge or survival skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

### Other Influencing [[factors_influencing_iq_scores | Factors]]
Beyond general intelligence, IQ scores are also influenced by:
*   **Motivation:** Incentivizing test-takers, especially those with below-average IQs, can increase scores by up to 20 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.
*   **Training and Coaching:** Familiarity with test questions and types can boost scores by up to eight points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **Test-Taking Strategy:** Skills like time management, question skipping, and eliminating wrong answers can affect performance under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.
*   **Anxiety:** While a small amount of anxiety can be beneficial, excessive anxiety negatively impacts performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

## Modern Applications and Views

Despite its contentious [[controversies_and_misconceptions_about_iq | history and origins of IQ tests]], particularly its use in the American eugenics movement to justify forced sterilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, IQ testing still has practical uses.
*   **Legal Context:** IQ tests are used in legal cases, such as the Atkins defense, to determine intellectual disability, which can exempt individuals from the death penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. Tests include measures to detect attempts to fake poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.
*   **Identifying Talent:** IQ tests can objectively identify individuals with strong intellectual abilities who might not otherwise be recognized due to social biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. They can lead to a higher proportion of poorer kids and minority ethnic children being placed in gifted programs compared to teacher recommendations alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.

While IQ scores can offer some predictive insights, it is a mistake to equate them with an individual's worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. Factors like building knowledge and analytical skills can dramatically improve life outcomes regardless of an initial IQ score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>. The only personality trait that correlates with IQ is openness to experience, suggesting that being willing to try new things leads to more learning and greater intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

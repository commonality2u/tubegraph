The question of "What is light?" has puzzled humanity for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Initial perceptions describe light as brightness that makes a room not dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, something that allows us to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. People also recognize that light comes in different colors, like blue and red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Early Theories

For centuries, the greatest minds in science debated the fundamental [[nature_of_light_particles_versus_waves | nature of light particles versus waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

*   In the late 1600s, Isaac Newton proposed that light was a stream of particles, or corpuscles, detailed in his treatise, *Opticks* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   Simultaneously, Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens put forth the idea that light was a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

This debate persisted for over a century until a pivotal experiment provided a strong indication toward one theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Young's Double Slit Experiment

The debate over the nature of light was largely settled by [[interference_patterns_and_light_behavior | Thomas Young's double slit experiment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Researching the Original Experiment

To ensure accuracy in recreating the experiment, researchers accessed the original source: Thomas Young's handwritten notes from 1803, stored in the vault beneath the Royal Society in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Young's notes described observing the shadow of a card, about one-thirtieth of an inch wide, and noting "fringes of color on each side of the shadow" and "similar parallel fringes, of smaller dimensions" within the shadow itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Recreation of the Experiment

A simple recreation of the experiment can be done using an empty box with an eyepiece and a small hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. A slide containing two very narrow, side-by-side openings (a double slit) is placed over the hole, and the box is tilted towards direct sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

#### Predictions vs. Observations

Before viewing the results, various predictions were made about what would be seen at the bottom of the box:
*   Two lines or broad-bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   One line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
*   The whole box lit up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
*   A kaleidoscope or a bunch of colors/rainbow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>

However, the actual observations were surprising:
*   Instead of two lines, multiple dots were seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   A strong, white dot appeared in the middle, flanked by two multicolored dots on either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   The pattern resembled a rainbow with many little dots, and more dots continued to appear and spread across the field of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

#### Explanation of Results: Wave Interference

The observed pattern makes no sense if light behaves solely as particles; particles would simply pass through the slits and create two bright spots underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The observed pattern is perfectly explained if light behaves as waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>:
*   **Interacting Waves**: Waves from one slit interact with waves from the other slit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Analogy**: This phenomenon can be demonstrated with water waves originating from two sources, creating an [[interference_patterns_and_light_behavior | interesting pattern]] of ripples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Constructive Interference**: Where the peaks of waves meet peaks, and troughs meet troughs, the amplitude of the wave increases. With light, this results in a bright spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Destructive Interference**: Where a peak from one wave meets a trough from another, they cancel each other out, resulting in no wave. With light, this means no light is seen, creating a dark spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Resulting Pattern**: This interaction creates an alternating pattern of bright and dark spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

#### Role of Wavelengths and Color

Sunlight is composed of many different colors, each possessing different wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Since different wavelengths will constructively and destructively interfere at slightly different points, this causes the "rainbowing effects" observed further from the central bright spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The [[interaction_of_light_with_different_wavelengths_causing_color_differences | difference in wavelengths]] is precisely what creates all the beautiful colors we see around us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Conclusion of the Debate (for a time)

The results of Young's double slit experiment were so convincing that the scientific community largely concluded that [[nature_of_light_particles_versus_waves | light must be a wave]], with no way it could be a particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Unanswered Observation

An observation from the experiment was that the light pattern at the bottom of the box appeared as round blobs rather than sharp slits. The reason for this specific shape is not explained in the transcript but is posed as a question for further thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

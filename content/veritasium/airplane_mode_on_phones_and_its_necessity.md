When asked to put a phone on airplane mode before a flight, passengers often wonder about the real reason behind the instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Common assumptions include avoiding interference with the plane's radio or instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, or general communication interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Historical Context of the Ban
The regulation of electronics on flights has evolved over time:
*   **1961:** The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) found that some portable FM radios could interfere with plane navigation systems because they used neighboring radio bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. As a precaution, the FAA banned almost all personal electronics on flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Airlines could test devices for interference and overrule the ban, except for phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **1991:** The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has jurisdiction over phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Their concern was that a phone on the ground typically connects to one or two cell towers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, but from the air, it could see 10 to 20 or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The FCC theorized that 200 phones moving at 800 kilometers per hour could rapidly connect to many towers simultaneously, potentially overloading ground infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Based on this theory, they banned cell phone use in flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## The Reality of Phone Interference
The theory that phones could disrupt ground networks has been largely debunked:
*   **Faraday Cage Effect:** A plane acts as a large metal enclosure, essentially a Faraday cage, which should block almost all electromagnetic signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Phone signals can primarily escape only through the windows, traveling horizontally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Cell Tower Direction:** Ground-based cell towers are typically tilted downwards to collect signals from people on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This makes it very difficult for a phone in the air to establish a connection unless the plane is flying very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Limited Disruption:** Phones could only conceivably disrupt ground networks during takeoff or landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Lack of Evidence:** The FCC never actually tested if this disruption was the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. In 2005, they stated that the rule banning 800 MHz cell phone use in flight might not be needed to protect ground-based cellular networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

### Conclusion on Safety
As far as is known, a mobile phone has never caused an air accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The only definite benefit of airplane mode for passengers is saving battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

## Pilot Perspective
A pilot acknowledged that while one phone might not cause problems, 200 phones potentially could lead to interference heard in air traffic control communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. To avoid any chance of issues, especially during critical phases of flight, the rule of keeping phones off remains in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

## Future of Airplane Mode
Airplane mode may soon become a thing of the past. The EU no longer requires it and is advocating for airlines to provide 5G service on all EU flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

## Media Influence
The persistence of the airplane mode rule is partly due to the media frenzy it generated in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. This highlights how sensationalized headlines can prioritize over key details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

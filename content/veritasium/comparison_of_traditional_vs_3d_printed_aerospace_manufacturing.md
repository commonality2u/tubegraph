Relativity Space, a startup, has developed the world's largest [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D metal printer]] with the aim of printing an entire rocket, including fuel tanks and rocket engines, in just 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach represents a significant shift from traditional aerospace manufacturing methods.

## Traditional Rocket Manufacturing

Traditionally, rockets are enormous, complex engineering projects manufactured using conventional techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This often means that before a rocket can be built, the specialized tools to build it must first be constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

For instance, to build NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, they first had to construct the Vertical Assembly Center (VAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This 170-foot tall tool is used for welding together the domes, rings, and barrel sections of the rocket's fuel tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The SLS took 11 years of development before one was assembled on the pad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

A traditional rocket engine injector, for example, could consist of over a thousand individual pieces and take nine months to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Similarly, on Space Shuttle main engines, the combustion chamber and nozzle required thousands of very small pipes (1,080 individual pipes) to be formed and then brazed together to create cooling channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This was a "ridiculously labor-intensive task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Traditional aerospace factories largely build products one at a time by hand, utilizing hundreds of thousands to millions of individual parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This paradigm has not significantly changed since the Apollo era <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Automation has not been widely adopted in aerospace due to the low production volume of rockets and the sheer number of parts involved compared to, for example, automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

## [[3D printing technology in rocket manufacturing | 3D Printed Rocket Manufacturing]]

Relativity Space's approach utilizes its large-scale [[3D printing technology in rocket manufacturing | 3D metal printer]], named Stargate, to print entire rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### The Printing Process

The [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]] process for large rocket components, such as fuel tanks, involves:
*   **Wire-melt technology**: An aluminum alloy wire from a spool serves as the raw metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Plasma arc discharge**: The wire is fed at about 10 inches per second, and a combination of lasers and plasma arc discharge work simultaneously to melt the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Precise deposition**: The electric waveform is changed every couple of milliseconds to control the deposition of the molten metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The temperature is just a few hundred degrees above aluminum's melting point of 660 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Layer-by-layer construction**: The entire body of the rocket is melted together one tiny bit at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Layers are visible on the finished product, but this only adds an extra 5-10% to the mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The surface roughness does not cause aerodynamic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Smaller parts**: Smaller, more complex parts like rocket nozzles are typically [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printed]] using metal powder and lasers, laying down very fine layers about a 20th the thickness of a human hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### [[Advantages of 3D printed rockets | Advantages of 3D Printing]]

[[3D printing technology in rocket manufacturing | 3D printing]] offers several significant [[advantages_of_3d_printed_rockets | benefits]] in aerospace manufacturing:

*   **Reduced Part Count**: One of the major [[advantages_of_3d_printed_rockets | benefits]] is the reduction in the number of parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
    *   An engine injector, which traditionally had over a thousand pieces, can be [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printed]] as a single piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   Rocket nozzles can have cooling channels for cryogenic propellants printed directly into a single part, eliminating the need for thousands of external pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
    *   A fully [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printed]] rocket can have a hundred times fewer parts than a traditionally built one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: [[3D printing]] allows for rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Parts can be built and tested quickly, then redesigned and reprinted rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. The design can be changed extremely fast because part geometries are controlled via CAD models, with printers printing directly from files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. An entire engine can be built in about a month, allowing for continuous improvement with new versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   **Optimized Design**: [[3D printing]] enables engineers to build parts that would be impractical or impossible with traditional techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This includes smooth, curvy, bio-inspired designs that are just as easy to print as ordinary structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The structures can be optimized for stiffness, such as printed stiffeners inside rocket tanks that prevent buckling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Material Strength**: Counterintuitively, [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printed]] materials can be stronger than traditionally built ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This is achieved by developing custom alloys in-house and taking advantage of the rapid melting and cooling/solidification process to achieve strong alloys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Cost and Time Reduction**: [[3D printing]] significantly reduces cost and time. An injector, for example, takes two weeks to print and costs 10 times less than its traditional counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. For a full rocket, this technology aims to lower costs by 5 to 10, or even 100 times, for a fully reusable rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   **Automation**: [[3D printing]] inherently brings automation to aerospace manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Instead of robots assembling millions of individual parts, the assembly is done in the [[3D file]], and the printer prints them assembled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Relativity Space's factory has no fixed tooling, unlike the rest of the aerospace industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

### [[Challenges and solutions in 3D printing rockets | Challenges and Solutions]]

Early experiences with [[3D printing]] can be frustrating, resulting in piles of unusable metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. However, [[challenges_and_solutions_in_3d_printing_rockets | solutions]] have been developed:
*   **Warping**: Printing a [[3D file]] directly would result in warped and unusable material due to cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Relativity Space invented software that "reverse warps" the part before printing, so the robots print a wobbly shape that becomes perfectly straight (within a human hair's thickness) as it cools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This entire process is simulated computationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Material properties**: Initial concerns about the strength of [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printed]] metals have been addressed by developing custom alloys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Impact and [[Future implications of 3D printed rockets on space exploration | Future Vision]]

Relativity Space's first rocket, Terran One, is designed mostly for low-earth orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Their next rocket, Terran R, is significantly larger (16-foot diameter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a> and capable of sending payloads to the Moon and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

The long-term vision of Relativity Space is to shrink their "factory of the future" down to something that can be launched to Mars to build an industrial base there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This factory is far smaller and lighter than a traditional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

Even if Relativity's rockets don't become the primary launch vehicles, the company is secure because they are now "world experts" on [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing rocket hardware]], having applied it to areas previously dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. The shift to [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]] in aerospace is seen as akin to the automotive industry's shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles, where the entire product, factory, and supply chain are transformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

This [[future_implications_of_3d_printed_rockets_on_space_exploration | technology]] is poised to lower the cost of space access significantly, potentially making space travel much cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The ultimate goal is to expand the possibilities of human experience, including the establishment of human civilization on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

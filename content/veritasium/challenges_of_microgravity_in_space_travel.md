Traveling to Mars would expose future colonists to prolonged periods of [[effects_of_microgravity_on_the_human_body | microgravity]] and different gravitational environments, posing significant [[space_exploration_challenges | challenges]] to human health and daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Simulating Microgravity

A "vomit comet" experience, sponsored by National Geographic, simulates microgravity by flying in a series of parabolic arcs, allowing everything inside to be in freefall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This plane can also simulate the gravity of other celestial bodies like the Moon and Mars by modifying the parabola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While this plane offers 30 seconds of microgravity, a real journey to Mars would involve eight months of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Physiological Impacts of Low Gravity

The human body, evolved over millions of years in Earth's gravity of 9.8 m/sÂ², faces significant adaptations in low or zero-gravity environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Muscle Atrophy and Bone Density Loss

Low gravity makes exercise difficult, as the natural weight of limbs no longer provides a workout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. On a journey to Mars or in space, muscles weaken and atrophy; studies show muscle mass can decrease by up to 20% in flights lasting just 5 to 11 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Similarly, the lack of weight pushing on bones leads to a decrease in bone density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Astronauts can lose 1-2% of bone mass per month, primarily in their lower extremities, a rate over ten times faster than osteoporosis on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

To combat this, astronauts rely on [[solutions_for_exercising_and_maintaining_health_in_space | elastic resistance]] for exercise, as traditional weightlifting is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. For example, astronauts on the space station are elastically tethered to a treadmill and typically exercise 2.5 hours every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Nausea

One of the major [[space_exploration_challenges | challenges]] posed by different gravity environments is nausea, as human bodies are not evolved for these situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Daily Life Challenges

In weightless conditions, everyday activities become more challenging:
*   **Liquids**: Surface tension becomes significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Dealing with liquids in microgravity is difficult, making showering, brushing teeth, and going to the bathroom much harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Washing one's face becomes a complex task due to how water holds together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Physical Phenomena in Microgravity

The absence of Earth's gravity reveals strange effects. For instance, an object spun about its intermediate axis exhibits unstable rotation, causing it to flip back and forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This phenomenon, known as the intermediate axis theorem, has been observed with T-bar handles on the space station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Associated Challenges: Radiation Exposure

In addition to microgravity, a trip to Mars would expose individuals to significant amounts of [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Astronauts in orbit sometimes report seeing flashes of light with their eyes closed, which is believed to be a human body reaction to heavy particles or bursts of energy from cosmic [[radiation_exposure_during_space_travel | radiation]] passing through the eyeball or optic nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. [[radiation_hardening_in_space_missions_and_electronics | Radiation]] can be shielded using insulation within the ship or water, which is a terrific absorber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Adapting to Martian Gravity

On Mars, gravity is approximately 37% of Earth's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, allowing for much higher jumps and double the airtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. In contrast, the Moon's gravity is only 1/6 of Earth's, enabling extensive aerobics without exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These [[differences_in_gravity_between_earth_moon_and_mars | differences in gravity]] mean that while a person would feel lighter on Mars, wearing a spacesuit (currently weighing up to 310 pounds) would make them feel as heavy as they are on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This could also help maintain muscle and bone mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

Despite these difficulties, these challenges are seen not as deal-breakers but as obstacles to overcome for humanity to become a multiplanetary species and ensure long-term survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

The "37% Rule," also known as the Secretary Problem or the Marriage Problem, provides an optimal strategy for making decisions when faced with a sequence of options that must be accepted or rejected immediately and permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. This principle suggests a mathematical approach to maximize the chances of selecting the best possible option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## How the 37% Rule Works

When encountering a series of choices where you cannot assess all options simultaneously (e.g., apartment rentals, job offers, or even choosing a life partner), the optimal strategy is to first explore a certain percentage of options to gain information, and then commit to the first option that surpasses all previously observed ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:59">[01:22:59]</a>.

The steps for this strategy are as follows:
1.  **Explore and Reject:** Systematically observe and reject a predetermined initial percentage of options. The purpose of this phase is solely to understand the range and quality of available choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
2.  **Select the Best:** After this exploratory phase, choose the very next option that is better than all the options seen during the initial exploration period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. If no such option appears, you might be forced to choose the last option available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

This method maximizes the chances of selecting the best overall option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## Mathematical Derivation

[[Probability theory in problem solving | Probability theory in problem solving]] is at the heart of the 37% rule. The optimal stopping point (S) in a sequence of N options maximizes the probability of picking the best option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

The probability of selecting the best option is given by the formula:
`P = (S / N) * ln(N / S)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>

To find the maximum probability, the derivative of this function is set to zero, which leads to the conclusion that `ln(S/N) = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This simplifies to `S/N = 1/e`, where 'e' is Euler's number (approximately 2.718) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

Therefore, `S/N` is approximately 0.3678, or about 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. By exploring and rejecting approximately 37% of the options, the chance of success using this method is also around 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## Practical Applications

This rule applies to various real-world scenarios where [[strategies_for_complex_problem_solving | strategies for complex problem solving]] are needed for sequential decision-making:

*   **Hiring Decisions:** When interviewing candidates for a position, observing the first 37% of applicants provides a benchmark. The first subsequent candidate who is superior to all those in the initial group should be hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Real Estate:** When searching for an apartment, tour the first 37% of available options to gauge the market. Then, commit to the next apartment that is better than any of the ones previously seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Relationship Decisions:** If one plans to get married within a certain timeframe (e.g., 10 years), the first 3.7 years should be spent dating to understand potential partners. After this period, the next person encountered who is better than anyone previously dated should be considered for marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Small Choices:** Even seemingly minor decisions, like when to stop for gas on a road trip, can benefit from this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

While it can be impractical if the total number of options (N) is unknown, the 37% rule can also be applied to a fixed timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## Subconscious Recognition

Humanity appears to subconsciously recognize the [[the_significance_of_the_number_37 | significance of the number 37]] in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. It is regarded as a prime number and often picked as a "random" choice by people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This gravitational pull towards the number suggests an innate inclination towards the optimal point for making choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

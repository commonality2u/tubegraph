From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

The Poynting vector is a mathematical construct used in physics to describe the directional energy flux (the rate of energy flow per unit area) of an electromagnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. It is represented by the symbol *S* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a> and is calculated using the cross product of the electric field (E) and magnetic field (B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>:

S = (1/μ₀) * (E x B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>

where μ₀ is the permeability of free space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. The direction of the Poynting vector indicates the direction of energy flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

## Historical Context

In the 1860s and 1870s, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell made a significant breakthrough by realizing that light consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. These fields oscillate perpendicular to each other and are in phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Maxwell developed equations, now known as Maxwell's equations, that govern the behavior of these [[the_role_of_electromagnetic_fields_in_energy_transmission | electromagnetic fields]] and waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

In 1883, John Henry Poynting, one of Maxwell's former students, applied the principle of conservation of energy to these fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. He theorized that if energy is locally conserved, its path of flow from one place to another should be traceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## Energy Flow in Light

For light, the Poynting vector demonstrates that energy flows perpendicular to both the electric and magnetic fields, in the same direction that light travels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. This means light carries energy from its source to its destination via its [[the_role_of_electromagnetic_fields_in_energy_transmission | electric and magnetic fields]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

Crucially, Poynting's equation applies not only to light but to any scenario where electric and magnetic fields coincide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. Wherever these fields exist together, there is a flow of energy that can be calculated using the Poynting vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

## Energy Flow in Electric Circuits

Contrary to common misconceptions, electrical energy in circuits is primarily carried by [[the_role_of_electromagnetic_fields_in_energy_transmission | electromagnetic fields]] *outside* the wires, not by the electrons within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Common Misconceptions

Many people are taught that:
*   Electrons themselves possess potential energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
*   Electrons are pushed or pulled through a continuous conducting loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   Electrons dissipate their energy directly in the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

This understanding is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. There are physical gaps in electrical lines, such as transformers, where electrons cannot flow continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Additionally, if electrons carried the energy, it would be difficult to explain why energy flows only one way (from source to device) when electron flow can be bidirectional (as in AC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

### How it Actually Works

In a simple DC circuit (e.g., a battery and a light bulb):
1.  When a battery is connected, its electric field extends through the circuit at the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.
2.  This electric field causes electrons to accumulate on certain conductor surfaces (making them negatively charged) and deplete from others (leaving them positively charged) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.
3.  These surface charges create a small electric field *inside* the wires, causing electrons to drift slowly (around 0.1 mm/s) in one direction, forming the current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
4.  The surface charges also create an electric field *outside* the wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
5.  The current *inside* the wires creates a magnetic field *outside* the wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
6.  The combination of these [[the_role_of_electromagnetic_fields_in_energy_transmission | electric and magnetic fields]] in the space around the circuit results in a flow of energy, as described by the Poynting vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

Using the right-hand rule for the cross product (E x B), the energy flux can be visualized:
*   Around the battery, energy flows radially outwards into the fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.
*   Along the wires, energy flows in the direction of the circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.
*   At the light bulb filament, the Poynting vector is directed *inward*, meaning the light bulb receives energy from the surrounding fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

Energy takes many paths from the battery to the bulb, but in all cases, it is transmitted by the surrounding [[the_role_of_electromagnetic_fields_in_energy_transmission | electric and magnetic fields]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. Even though electrons may move in two directions (away from and towards the battery), the energy flux, as determined by the Poynting vector, flows in only one direction: from the source to the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. This confirms that the fields, not the electrons, carry the energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

### Alternating Current (AC) Circuits

The same analysis holds true for AC circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. While the current direction reverses every half cycle, causing both the electric and magnetic fields to flip simultaneously, the Poynting vector still points in the same direction: from the source to the load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. This explains how power lines transmit energy from power plants to homes; electrons merely oscillate back and forth within the wires, but the oscillating [[the_role_of_electromagnetic_fields_in_energy_transmission | electromagnetic fields]] outside the wires carry the power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

## Real-World Validation: Submarine Cables

The practical importance of understanding energy flow through fields was highlighted during the laying of early undersea telegraph cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. The first Transatlantic cable, laid in 1858, suffered from severe signal distortion and lengthening, making it difficult to differentiate messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.

A debate ensued among scientists:
*   William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) believed electrical signals moved like water through a rubber tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
*   Others, like Heaviside and Fitzgerald, correctly argued that it was the fields *around* the wires that carried the energy and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

The latter view proved correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. The problem with the cable was its design: the central copper conductor was coated in an insulator and then encased in an iron sheath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:10:00]</a>. Although intended for strength, the conductive iron interfered with the propagation of [[the_role_of_electromagnetic_fields_in_energy_transmission | electromagnetic fields]] by increasing the capacitance of the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>. This historical event demonstrated that understanding the behavior of fields is crucial for effective energy transmission.

This is also why modern power lines are suspended high above the ground, maintaining a large insulating gap of air, as even damp earth can act as a conductor and interfere with the fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

## The Long Wire Circuit Thought Experiment

Consider a hypothetical circuit with a battery, a switch, a light bulb one meter away, and two wires each 300,000 kilometers long (the distance light travels in one second) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

When the switch is closed, the light bulb lights up almost instantaneously, in approximately 1/C seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>. This is because the limiting factor is not the travel of an electric field *down the wire* for a light-second, but rather the propagation of the [[the_role_of_electromagnetic_fields_in_energy_transmission | electric and magnetic fields]] *through the space around the wires* to the light bulb, which is only one meter away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. These fields can reach the bulb in a few nanoseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

This thought experiment further illustrates that the energy is delivered by the traveling [[the_role_of_electromagnetic_fields_in_energy_transmission | electromagnetic waves]] around the power lines, not by the flow of electrons through the wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

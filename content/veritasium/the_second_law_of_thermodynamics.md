From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

The second law of thermodynamics is a fundamental concept in physics that governs everything from molecular collisions to large-scale cosmic events, influencing the universe's evolution and its ultimate fate, and potentially even determining the direction of time and the existence of life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Energy Transfer and the Earth-Sun System

The Earth receives a certain amount of energy from the sun and radiates an equal amount of energy back into space to maintain a stable temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Although the total amount of energy remains constant—as energy is never truly "used up" but rather transformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>—what the Earth *really* gets from the sun is a steady stream of low [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]], concentrated energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

## Historical Development

The understanding of this concept traces back to discoveries made two centuries ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Sadi Carnot and the Ideal Heat Engine

In the early 19th century, Sadi Carnot, a 17-year-old student, was inspired to improve the efficiency of steam engines, which were crucial for industrial and military might but lagged in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. At the time, even the best steam engines converted only about 3% of thermal energy into useful mechanical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Carnot's key insight involved defining [[carnots_ideal_heat_engine_and_efficiency | an ideal heat engine]] that operates without friction or energy losses to the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This engine consists of a chamber with a piston, using two large metal bars—one hot and one cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Heat flows from the hot bar to expand air, pushing the piston, and then heat is transferred to the cold bar as the air is compressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

What's notable about Carnot's ideal engine is its complete reversibility: running it in reverse would return everything to its original state without additional energy input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Despite its reversibility, the engine's efficiency cannot reach 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This is because some heat must always be dumped into the cold bar to complete the cycle and return the piston to its starting position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The efficiency depends fundamentally on the temperatures of the hot and cold sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Achieving 100% efficiency would require an infinite temperature on the hot side or absolute zero on the cold side, both of which are impossible in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Lord Kelvin and Absolute Temperature

Lord Kelvin recognized that Carnot's ideal heat engine could form the basis for an absolute temperature scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. He conceived of "absolute zero" as the point where gas particles would cease movement, exerting no pressure, and thus requiring no work to compress on the cold side, resulting in no heat loss and theoretically 100% efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Using this Kelvin scale, efficiency can be expressed as a function of the hot and cold side temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Real engines, unlike ideal ones, suffer from friction, heat dissipation to the environment, and non-constant temperature heat transfer, leading to much lower efficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. When energy spreads out due to these factors, it becomes impossible to retrieve, making the process irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Energy is most usable when concentrated and least usable when spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

### Rudolf Clausius and the Definition of Entropy

Decades later, German physicist Rudolf Clausius studied Carnot's engine and devised a way to measure how "spread out" energy is, coining the term "[[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Low [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] corresponds to concentrated energy (like in a hot bar), while high [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] signifies energy dispersed into the surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. When [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] increases, the same amount of energy is present but is less available to do work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

In 1865, Clausius famously summarized the first two laws of thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>:
1.  **The energy of the universe is constant** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
2.  **The [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] of the universe tends to a maximum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This means energy naturally spreads out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

### Implications of the Second Law

The second law explains numerous phenomena:
*   Hot objects cool down, and cold objects heat up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   Gas expands to fill any container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   Perpetual motion machines are impossible because the amount of usable energy in a closed system constantly decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

While often described as "disorder," the best way to understand [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] is as the tendency of energy to spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Ludwig Boltzmann and Probability

Ludwig Boltzmann provided a crucial insight: energy spreading out and heat flowing from cold to hot is not impossible, but merely highly improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This is due to the vast number of possible configurations that result in a more even distribution of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. For systems with many atoms, such as everyday solids, the likelihood of energy concentrating rather than spreading becomes astronomically small, making such events effectively never observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This is analogous to a Rubik's cube, which has only one solved state but quintillions of messy states, making it far more likely to become random with arbitrary turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

### Local Decreases in Entropy

A decrease in [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] in one system, such as a house getting cooler from air conditioning, is only possible if [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] increases by a greater amount elsewhere, for example, at a power plant where concentrated chemical energy is dispersed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

### Earth as an Open System and the Role of the Sun

If Earth were a closed system, all energy would spread out, leading to the cessation of life and uniform temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Fortunately, Earth is not a closed system; it relies on the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. The sun provides a continuous supply of low [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]], concentrated energy, which is more useful than the spread-out energy Earth radiates back into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

Life on Earth flourishes by converting fewer, high-energy photons from the sun into many more lower-energy photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. This process involves capturing energy, maintaining biological structures, and converting it into thermal energy, which ultimately increases overall [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Without a concentrated energy source and a way to discard spread-out energy, life would not be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

It has even been suggested that life itself may be a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. Life can be seen as a spectacularly efficient way to accelerate the natural tendency of the universe towards maximum [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] by converting low [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] into high [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Jeremy England proposed that a constant stream of clumped energy could favor structures that dissipate that energy, leading to better energy dissipators and, eventually, to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

### Entropy in the Universe

The sun's low [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] ultimately originates from the universe itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Given that the total [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] of the universe is always increasing, it implies that [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] was lowest right after the Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. This concept is known as the "past hypothesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

Initially, the early universe was hot, dense, and almost perfectly uniform in temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. However, factoring in gravity, matter being spread out uniformly is an extremely unlikely state, making it a state of low [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

Over time, as the universe expanded and cooled, matter began to clump together due to gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. This process converted vast amounts of potential energy into kinetic energy, some of which was then converted into heat as matter collided, thereby decreasing useful energy and increasing [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. This increase in [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] is what enabled the formation of stars, planets, galaxies, and life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

### Black Holes and Entropy

In 1972, Jacob Bekenstein proposed that black holes are another significant source of [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]], proportional to their surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Stephen Hawking, initially aiming to disprove Bekenstein, surprisingly found that black holes do indeed emit radiation (Hawking radiation) and possess a temperature, thus confirming Bekenstein's theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

Black holes account for an enormous amount of the universe's [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]]—approximately 3 x 10<sup>104</sup> Boltzmann constants—far more than all other particles combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. The early universe had a minuscule fraction (0.000000000000003%) of the [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] it currently possesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

## The Arrow of Time and the [[heat_death_of_the_universe | Heat Death of the Universe]]

All processes in the universe, from planetary formation to life flourishing, occur because the universe's [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] was initially low and has been continuously increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. This irreversible increase is why there is a clear distinction between past and future, creating the "arrow of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

This process is expected to continue until the energy becomes so completely spread out that nothing further of interest can happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. This ultimate state is known as the [[heat_death_of_the_universe | heat death of the universe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. In this distant future, after the last black hole has evaporated, the universe will reach its most probable state, and the arrow of time itself will disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.

While maximum [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] implies low complexity, low [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] does not automatically mean maximum complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. Complex structures, like intricate patterns formed when milk mixes with tea, appear and thrive in the intermediate states between low and high [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. Humanity exists in this complex middle state, making use of the available low [[concept_of_entropy_in_physics | entropy]] while it can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

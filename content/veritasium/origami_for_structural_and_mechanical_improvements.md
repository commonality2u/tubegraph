Engineers are increasingly looking to [[origami_in_modern_engineering | origami]] for [[innovations_in_origamiinspired_technology | inspiration]] across various fields, from medical devices to space technology and even bulletproofing applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The ancient art of paper folding, dating back at least 400 years in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, has proven remarkably useful for modern engineering challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Historical Development and Renaissance

Historically, the number of [[origami_in_modern_engineering | origami]] designs was limited to perhaps 100-200 total in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. A significant shift occurred in the 20th century, largely due to Japanese [[origami_in_modern_engineering | origami]] masters like Akira Yoshizawa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Yoshizawa created thousands of new designs, authored many books, and inspired a worldwide renaissance in [[origami_in_modern_engineering | origami]] creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

One example of complex [[origami_in_modern_engineering | origami]] is a cactus and pot folded from a single, uncut square of paper, green on one side and red on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This particular piece started as a one-meter square sheet and took approximately seven years to complete from start to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Why Origami is Useful in Engineering

[[origami_in_modern_engineering | Origami]] is useful because it provides a method for transforming a flat sheet into another shape with relatively little processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Its principles are scalable, enabling both macro and micro applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## [[applications_of_origami_in_medical_devices_and_space_technology | Applications of Origami in Medical Devices and Space Technology]]

### Medical Devices
[[origami_in_modern_engineering | Origami]] principles are being applied to create advanced medical tools:
*   **Flexible Catheters**: [[origami_in_modern_engineering | Origami]] bellows have been developed for flexible catheters used with surgical robots (like the Da Vinci Surgical Robot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. These bellows ensure that a central hole remains the same size, providing continuous support for the catheter as it's inserted into the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Mini Grippers/Forceps**: [[origami_in_modern_engineering | Origami]]-inspired forceps can be miniaturized to fit through small incisions, then morph inside the body to perform complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. A variant of this mini gripper is used in robotic surgeries, reducing the number of parts by 75% while offering a wider range of motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Nano Injectors**: Microscopic [[origami_in_modern_engineering | origami]] has led to the development of nano injectors for gene therapy, designed to deliver DNA to cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. These injectors are only four micrometers thick, allowing 400 of them to fit onto a one-centimeter-wide computer chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Space Technology
[[origami_in_modern_engineering | Origami]] patterns are crucial for deployable structures in space:
*   **Miura Ori**: This pattern is considered the "granddaddy" of deployable structures and was one of the first [[origami_in_modern_engineering | origami]] patterns used in space, flying on the Space Flyer Unit mission in 1995 for solar arrays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. It opens and closes in a single motion, becoming very thin and compact when flattened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Origami Flasher**: Proposed as a design for satellite solar arrays, this pattern increases compactness for launch and enhances reliability in deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Other Engineering Applications

*   **Bulletproof Collapsible Walls**: Based on the Yoshimura crease pattern, a foldable bulletproof wall can be made from bulletproof material, remaining compact enough for a police car but deployable to provide protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Twelve layers of Kevlar using this design can stop handgun bullets, with new designs aiming to stop rifle rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Locomotive Aerodynamics**: Research into [[origami_in_modern_engineering | origami]]-inspired designs aims to improve the aerodynamics of freight locomotives, which are typically "like bricks going down the tracks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. A scaled prototype nose cone that folds flat for storage and deploys to improve aerodynamics has been tested, showing potential savings of millions of dollars annually in diesel fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **[[design_and_production_of_compliant_mechanisms | Compliant Mechanisms]]**: The functional motions of [[origami_in_modern_engineering | origami]] are inspiring new designs for [[design_and_production_of_compliant_mechanisms | compliant mechanisms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Unlike traditional mechanisms with bearings or hinges, [[compliant_mechanisms_in_micro_and_macro_engineering | compliant mechanisms]] gain motion from the flexibility of their material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. An [[origami_in_modern_engineering | origami]]-inspired design, the Kalita cycle, was created to demonstrate a continuously revolving [[compliant_mechanisms_in_micro_and_macro_engineering | compliant mechanism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Increased Rigidity**: An intrinsic benefit of [[origami_in_modern_engineering | origami]] is that the simple act of folding a material can make it more rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, allowing for stronger structures using thinner materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges: Folding Thick, Rigid Materials

While [[origami_in_modern_engineering | origami]] traditionally uses paper, engineering applications often require folding thick, rigid materials like polypropylene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This challenge is overcome by using "surrogate folds" to replace creases, and by cutting or scoring materials and adding hinges as necessary to accommodate thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## [[mathematical_principles_in_origami_design | Mathematical Principles in Origami Design]]

The design of complex [[origami_in_modern_engineering | origami]] requires significant mathematical modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Crease Patterns
[[mathematical_principles_in_origami_design | Origami]] design relies on representing a pattern through a "crease pattern," which is a plan for how to fold a specific shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

### Circle Packing Method
For designs that can be represented as "stick figures" (like a scorpion with a body, tail, and legs), the circle packing method is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
1.  **Feature Representation**: Each feature (e.g., claw, leg, tail) is represented by an abstract circular region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
2.  **Arrangement**: These circles of varying sizes are arranged or "packed" onto a square sheet of paper, similar to packing balls into a box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
3.  **Skeleton of Crease Pattern**: The arrangement of these circles forms the "skeleton" of the crease pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
4.  **Geometric Construction**: Rules are then followed to geometrically construct all the crease lines. For instance, a line is drawn between the center of every pair of circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. When two lines meet in a 'V' shape, a "ridge fold" is added halfway in between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
5.  **Final Pattern**: This systematic, step-by-step process constructs all necessary lines. The circles, acting as scaffolding, are then conceptually removed, leaving the precise pattern of folds required to create the desired shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. This method revolutionized [[origami_in_modern_engineering | origami]] design, ensuring the fold pattern yields the exact target shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Origamizer Algorithm
For folding objects that are more like surfaces (e.g., a sphere or a blobby body) rather than stick figures, different algorithms are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Around 2010, Japanese mathematician Tomohiro Tachi developed "Origamizer," an algorithm that can take any triangulated surface as a mathematical description and generate the corresponding folding pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. This means a sheet of virtually any material can be folded into any three-dimensional shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

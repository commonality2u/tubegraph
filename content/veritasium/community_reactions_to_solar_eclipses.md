The [[total_solar_eclipse_experience | total solar eclipse experience]] on August 21st, 2017, in Madras, Oregon, evoked strong reactions from observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The event was met with clear skies, providing optimal viewing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Atmospheric Changes and Anticipation
Even 17 minutes before totality, the light began to change, becoming noticeably dimmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. A cold wind also swept in, contributing to the cooling and darkening environment, which observers found exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. As the sun became about 90 percent covered, observers noted that shadows grew much sharper, an [[effects_during_a_solar_eclipse | effect during a solar eclipse]] resulting from the light originating from a single sliver of the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## During Totality
Once totality began, reactions quickly escalated to exclamations of awe and disbelief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Observers described the scene as "insane," "unbelievable," and "absolutely insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The sensation was also described as "totally creepy" and "weird," with the presence of a breeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

A striking phenomenon observed was the appearance of "sunset - sunrise" in every direction, which elicited strong reactions from the crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This unexpected visual prompted cries of "Oh my God" and comments like "This, just looks so wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. During this phase, visible features like prominences and the solar Corona, along with Venus, added to the surreal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Many found themselves speechless, describing the moment as "unreal" and "totally nuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. One observer noted that the sky looked "like a hole in the sky!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The return of the sun, marked by the diamond ring [[photography_techniques_for_eclipses | effect]], was met with loud cheering and widespread excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

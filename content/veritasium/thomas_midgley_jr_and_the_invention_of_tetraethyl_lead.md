Thomas Midgley Jr. was a chemist and engineer credited with creating inventions that caused significant harm to human health and the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His work is associated with two major environmental disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Early Automotive Challenges: Engine Knocking

In the early 20th century, advancements in automotive technology led to more powerful cars, such as the Cadillac Model 30, which could reach speeds of 45 miles per hour and had 40 horsepower, double that of the Ford Model T <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. However, these high-compression internal combustion engines faced a problem known as "engine knocking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This occurred when the fuel-air mixture spontaneously combusted before the spark plug ignited it, leading to haphazard combustions and turbulent pressure waves inside the cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Engine knocking not only produced a deafening sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> but also reduced power output, lowered fuel efficiency, and damaged engine components, shortening the engine's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Engine knocking could be corrected by changing the fuel, as different fuels could withstand varying levels of compression before detonating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The octane rating system was developed to quantify this, with iso-octane rated at 100 (high compression resistance) and n-heptane at 0 (low compression resistance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## The Search for an Anti-Knock Additive

Charles Kettering, who had developed the self-starting car for Cadillac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, sought an additive to increase the octane rating of ordinary fuel and eliminate knocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. He hired Thomas Midgley Jr. to find such a compound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Midgley experimented with various substances, including melted butter, camphor, ethyl acetate, and aluminum chloride, most of which had little effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Ethanol showed promise, stopping knocking, but it required a concentration of about 10% of the fuel mixture, making it expensive and difficult to profit from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Midgley sought a cheap, easy-to-produce, and effective additive at low concentrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

He next tried tellurium, which worked "wonderfully" as an anti-knock agent but had a terrible, persistent smell that even caused Midgley to sleep in his basement for seven months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Despite its effectiveness, Midgley concluded that "humanity would suffer this smell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Discovery of Tetraethyl Lead (TEL)

On December 3, 1921, after five years of research, Midgley discovered what he believed was the perfect solution: tetraethyl lead (TEL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. TEL effectively stopped knocking, had no smell, was cheap to produce, and was readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Crucially, it was effective at a very low concentration, just one part in 1000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Midgley and Kettering quickly recognized the immense profit potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Commercialization and Cover-up

Midgley and Kettering patented the process for making tetraethyl lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. They deliberately named their new additive "Ethyl," possibly to avoid association with lead and confuse it with ethyl alcohol, a common additive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. They partnered with General Motors, [[DuPont and chemical contamination coverup|DuPont]], and Standard Oil of New Jersey to form the Ethyl Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

At the 1923 Indianapolis 500, the top three finishers used Ethyl, leading to a rapid increase in demand for leaded gasoline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The Ethyl Corporation built a new chemical plant in New Jersey to meet demand, but within two months, dozens of workers fell ill with lead poisoning, and five died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

To counter public outcry, Midgley held a press conference where he poured tetraethyl lead onto his hands and inhaled it for a full minute, claiming it could be done daily without harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. However, Midgley himself knew the dangers, having spent much of 1923 recovering from lead poisoning in Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. He avoided his company's product when possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Known Dangers of Lead

The dangers of lead had been known for hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. As early as 1786, Benjamin Franklin noted lead's known toxicity and its long-standing use despite the risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Doctors and public health officials from institutions like MIT, Harvard, Yale, and the U.S. Health Service warned Midgley against producing tetraethyl lead, calling it a "creeping and malicious poison" and a "serious menace to public health" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Their concerns were dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

Lead is dangerous even in small doses because it mimics calcium in the body, making it difficult to excrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. It can be stored in bones for years, continuing to poison the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. The brain is particularly sensitive to lead, which breaks down the myelin sheath around axons and prevents neurotransmitter release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Symptoms of lead poisoning include headaches, memory loss, and tingling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Children are especially susceptible, with exposure leading to permanent learning disorders and behavioral problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### Environmental Impact and Health Consequences

By the 1950s, millions of motorists worldwide were burning leaded gasoline, releasing lead into the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Scientists funded by the Ethyl Corporation claimed lead was a natural part of the environment and not harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. However, [[Clair Patterson's work on measuring Earth's age and lead contamination]] (initially hampered by lead contamination) demonstrated that lead pollution was recent and largely due to human activity, especially the use of tetraethyl lead in gasoline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>
> "And of course, the spike in the 20th century due to industrialization and Tetraethyl lead."

Studies revealed that 20th-century Americans had 1,000 times more lead in their bones than ancient populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Lead exposure, even below levels once considered safe, caused delayed learning, decreased IQ, and increased behavioral problems in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. There is a broad consensus, outside the lead industry, that lead is extremely toxic at very low doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. As a result, the CDC's acceptable level of lead in children's blood dropped significantly, and it is now understood that there is no safe level of lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

Globally, lead is believed to be responsible for nearly two-thirds of all unexplained intellectual disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. A 2022 study estimated that over half of the current U.S. population (170 million people) were exposed to high lead levels in early childhood, resulting in an aggregate loss of over 800 million IQ points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

Furthermore, there is a strong correlation between lead exposure and crime rates, with the U.S. crime rate mirroring preschool blood lead levels with a 20-year offset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. This pattern has been observed in other countries as well, and there is a causal connection between lead exposure and antisocial or violent behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

The precise death toll from lead exposure is difficult to estimate, but it is linked to increased cardiovascular disease due to hardening of the arteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. A 2018 study suggested lead was responsible for 250,000 heart disease deaths per year in the U.S., potentially amounting to 25 million deaths over a century in the U.S. alone, and possibly 100 million globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Most of these deaths are attributed to Midgley's decision to add lead to gasoline, a substance he knew was toxic, for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

### Phasing Out Leaded Gasoline

Japan was the first country to ban leaded fuel in cars in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. Algeria was the last to do so in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. The United Nations calculates that the elimination of lead from gasoline saves over a million lives per year and $2.45 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. However, leaded gasoline is still used in piston-driven airplane engines, which are now the largest source of lead emissions into the air in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

## Midgley's Other Invention: CFCs

After his success with Ethyl, Midgley was put in charge of another engineering project: developing a safer refrigerant for household appliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. The common refrigerants at the time, methyl formate and sulfur dioxide, were highly toxic or flammable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. In 1928, Midgley developed dichlorodifluoromethane, which GM marketed as Freon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. At its unveiling, Midgley demonstrated Freon's safety by inhaling a lungful of the gas and blowing out a candle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

In subsequent decades, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) like Freon became widely used as refrigerants, solvents, and aerosols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. However, their stability allowed them to reach the stratosphere, where ultraviolet light would break them apart, releasing chlorine atoms that reacted with and depleted the ozone layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. This created the ozone hole, increasing UV light penetration and raising rates of skin cancer and cataracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. CFCs are also potent greenhouse gases, contributing 10,000 times more warming per kilogram than CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. The historian John McNeil noted that Midgley had "more impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth's history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. The Montreal Protocol, an agreement to phase out CFCs, went into effect in 1989, and the ozone layer is now showing signs of recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

## Midgley's Death

In 1940, at age 51, Midgley contracted polio, which left him physically disabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. He devised a mechanical bed controlled by ropes and pulleys to help him get up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. On November 2, 1944, Midgley died of strangulation after becoming tangled in the ropes of his invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

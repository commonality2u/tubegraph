Errors in standardized tests, such as the [[role_of_standardized_tests_like_the_sat_in_college_admissions | SAT]], can have significant consequences, impacting student opportunities, administrative costs, and the overall perception of these high-stakes examinations. One notable example is a specific SAT question from 1982 that was incorrectly written by the test designers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## The 1982 [[the_sat_question_everybody_got_wrong | SAT Question Everybody Got Wrong]]

In 1982, [[the_sat_question_everybody_got_wrong | one SAT question]] posed a geometric problem: "In the figure above, the radius of circle A is 1/3 the radius of circle B. Starting from the position shown in the figure, circle A rolls around circle B. At the end of how many revolutions of circle A will the center of the circle first reach its starting point." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> The given options were 3/2, three, six, 9/2, or nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

The intuitive, but incorrect, answer chosen by many, including the test writers, was three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This was based on the logic that if Circle B's circumference is three times that of Circle A, it should take three rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. However, the correct answer, four, was not among the options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

### Discovery of the Error

Out of 300,000 test takers, only three students—Shivan Kartha, Bruce Taub, and Doug Jungreis—identified and reported the error to the College Board, the SAT administrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. They were confident in their assertion that the test writers were wrong and provided proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### The "Coin Rotation Paradox" and the True Answer

The problem illustrates the "coin rotation paradox," where a rolling circle completes an additional rotation beyond what is intuitively expected when circling another object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. For the 1982 SAT question, Circle A rotates four times when rolling around Circle B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. This extra rotation accounts for the circular path itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

A general solution states that the number of rotations is found by taking the ratio of the circumferences (N) and adding one for the circular path (N+1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. This phenomenon applies broadly; the distance traveled by the center of a rolling circle is equal to the amount it has rotated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

### Multiple Interpretations of "Revolution"

The ambiguity of the question's wording also contributed to potential misinterpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>:
*   **Intuitive/Relative Perspective:** Counting rotations from Circle B's perspective or relative to itself yields three rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   **Astronomical Definition:** If "revolution" means a complete orbit around another body (like Earth revolving around the Sun), then Circle A only revolves once around Circle B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. This distinction between rotation and revolution is crucial in astronomy for accurate timekeeping, explaining the difference between a solar day and a sidereal day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

## Consequences of the Error

The College Board publicly admitted its mistake and nullified Question 17 for all test takers a few weeks after reviewing the students' letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

### Financial Cost

Rescoring the exams cost the testing service over $100,000, a cost that was ultimately borne by test-takers through fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>.

### Impact on Student Scores and Opportunities

While the nullification seemed fair, rescored results shifted student scores up or down by 10 points out of 800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. Although seemingly small, this change could have a significant impact on educational opportunities, especially for students close to strict minimum test score cutoffs for universities or scholarships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. A 10-point difference could influence which law school a student might attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>.

## Broader Context and Future of Standardized Testing

The SAT had a reputation for determining people's entire futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Mistakes like Question 17 were not supposed to occur on an exam so crucial for college admissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Question 17 was also "far from the last error on the SAT" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>.

In recent years, the [[role_of_standardized_tests_like_the_sat_in_college_admissions | role of standardized tests like the SAT]] has diminished. After COVID-19, nearly 80% of undergraduate colleges in the US no longer require standardized testing, suggesting that the SAT is "slowly becoming a thing of the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. The importance of careful wording in test questions remains, as acknowledged by one of the students who found the error, who later went on to write math competition problems himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

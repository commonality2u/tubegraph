Physics concepts can be brought to life through [[experimental_demonstrations_in_physics | experimental demonstrations]]. One classic example is the Rubens tube, which visualizes sound waves, and its advanced counterpart, the two-dimensional Pyro Board.

## The Rubens Tube

A Rubens tube is an [[experimental_demonstrations_in_physics | experimental demonstration]] device that consists of a pipe with numerous small holes along its length [00:00:15]. A flammable gas is pumped into the pipe and then lit, creating a row of small Bunsen burners [00:00:19]. When sounds are played into the tube, standing waves are set up within the gas [00:00:24].

### How it Works

Standing waves in the tube create patterns of air vibration where some areas experience significant vibration (anti-nodes) and others very little (nodes) [00:00:33]. This variation in vibration affects the flow rate of gas exiting the holes into the atmosphere, which in turn influences the height of the flames [00:00:38]. The result is a visual representation of the standing wave pattern of the sound [00:00:48].

## The Pyro Board: A 2D Rubens Tube

A team of physics and chemistry demonstrators in Denmark took the concept of the Rubens tube "to the next level" by creating a two-dimensional version known as the Pyro Board [00:00:49]. This device effectively functions as a "whole plane of Bunsen burners" [00:00:56].

The Pyro Board features 2,500 holes from which flames emerge [00:01:02]. The motivation behind its creation was the belief that "when you put on more fire, then it always gets better" [00:01:14].

### Demonstrating Standing Waves with the Pyro Board

Similar to a traditional Rubens tube, the Pyro Board allows for the visualization of standing waves by adjusting the frequency of the sound played into it [00:01:22].

*   **Fundamental Frequency:** The lowest frequency that generates a standing wave in the board's pulse creates a clear pattern [00:01:49].
*   **Volume Effects:** Varying the volume of the sound can cause dynamic changes in the flame heights [00:01:59].
*   **Nodes and Anti-nodes:** Observers can perceive the locations of nodes (minimal vibration, lower flames) and anti-nodes (maximum vibration, higher flames) both visually through the flames and audibly [00:02:27]. The flames specifically emerge in the anti-node regions [00:02:51].
*   **Higher Frequencies:** The Pyro Board can also demonstrate complex standing wave patterns at higher frequencies [00:03:04].
*   **Music Visualization:** The board can visualize music, with bass frequencies causing distinct flame reactions [00:03:36].

### Educational Outreach

The team uses the Pyro Board and other [[experimental_demonstrations_in_physics | experimental demonstrations]] to teach children about physics across Denmark [00:05:03]. They also share their work on a YouTube channel [00:05:12].

> The book *Galileo's Daughter* by Dava Sobel is recommended for its insight into Galileo's personal life through his daughter's letters, revealing the human aspect of a significant scientific figure [00:05:43].

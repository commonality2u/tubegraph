The **silicon sphere**, a 1-kilogram (2.2-pound) object composed of approximately 2.15 x 10^25 silicon-28 atoms, is recognized as [[the_worlds_roundest_object | the world's roundest object]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Its raw material alone was valued at 1 million Euros, and its current, precisely sculpted form is considered priceless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This sphere is a critical component in the ongoing effort to redefine the kilogram, moving its definition away from a physical artifact to a fundamental constant of nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Unprecedented Roundness

The extreme roundness of the silicon sphere is remarkable. To put it in perspective, if the sphere were the size of Earth, the difference between its highest "mountain" and lowest "valley" would be only about 14 meters (46 feet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This level of precision is achieved through a meticulous manufacturing process.

## Purpose: Redefining the Kilogram

The primary motivation for investing vast resources in perfecting this silicon sphere is to address long-standing issues with the current definition of the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### The Kilogram's History and Problems

The unit of mass has a rich history:
*   **The "Grave"**: Originally, the base unit of mass in the metric system was the "grave," defined in 1793 as the weight of a cubic decimeter (one liter) of water at the melting temperature of ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The name "grave" came from the Latin "gravitas" meaning weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This was abandoned due to its phonetic similarity to the aristocratic title "graf" during the French Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **The Gramme and Kilogram**: The "gramme" (one thousandth of a grave) was briefly adopted, but deemed too small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This led to the creation of the "kilogram" (a thousand grams), explaining why it's the only base SI unit with a prefix in its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Le Grand K**: In 1799, the kilogram was refined as the mass of a liter of water at 4 degrees Celsius (its densest temperature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. However, water proved impractical as a standard, leading to the creation of a platinum cylinder, the "Kilogram of the Archives," which became the definition of the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This was later upgraded in 1889 to a more durable platinum-iridium alloy cylinder, known as the "International Prototype Kilogram" or "Le Grand K" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Issues with Le Grand K

Le Grand K, housed in a climate-controlled vault near Paris, is currently the only object in the universe with an exact mass of one kilogram *by definition* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. However, this physical definition poses significant problems:
*   **Mass Divergence**: Replicas sent worldwide, and even Le Grand K itself, have shown mass divergence over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. For instance, after 40 years, masses diverged by up to 50 micrograms (the weight of a fingerprint), even after careful washing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. The exact cause of this instability remains speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Instability**: A unit of measurement cannot change its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The instability of Le Grand K affects four of the seven base SI units and numerous derived units (like Newtons, Joules, Volts, and Watts) that depend on the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## The Silicon Sphere Solution

The silicon sphere offers a path to a more stable, natural constant-based definition of the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Atomic Counting**: Unlike Le Grand K, the silicon sphere's value isn't based on its physical form as the *definition*, but on the *count* of its atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Since the sphere is a perfect crystal of highly pure silicon, specifically the single isotope silicon-28, the number of atoms can be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The use of a single isotope, silicon-28, explains the material's high cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Sphere Design**: A spherical shape is chosen for its simplicity, as its entire dimension can be characterized by knowing its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing and Measurement**: The sphere is produced by progressively grinding an oversized sphere using abrasives, essentially "massaging atoms" to control the shape at an atomic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Its diameter is then measured with extreme accuracy using lasers, which allows for the precise determination of its volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Given the known, highly precise atom spacing in silicon, the total number of atoms in the sphere can be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Redefining Avogadro's Constant**: This process allows for the redefinition of Avogadro's constant. Currently, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram (number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. With the silicon sphere, the fixed number of silicon atoms in the sphere would define Avogadro's constant, which would then, in turn, define the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

This redefinition would mean the kilogram is defined by a concept—a specific number of atoms—rather than a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. A potential future definition might state: "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15 x 10^25 silicon-28 atoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Collaboration and Future Outlook

The creation of the silicon sphere was an international collaboration of scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This approach to redefining the kilogram complements another method involving fixing Planck's constant using a Watt Balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Both approaches serve as checks on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. If uncertainties can be reduced to around 20 micrograms, the kilogram could be redefined, potentially as early as 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, ensuring it becomes an unchanging unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

Remarkably, Antoine Lavoisier, a scientist involved in the original definition of the "grave" in 1793, also conceived of silicon as an element in 1787, showing a connection from the earliest attempts to define mass to the cutting-edge efforts of atomic precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

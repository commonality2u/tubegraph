[[Potential for Alien Life on Europa]]

The idea of life on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, has fascinated scientists and authors alike for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Arthur C. Clarke's sequel to "2001, A Space Odyssey," titled "2010, Odyssey Two," featured an alien intelligence converting Jupiter into a star and sending a message warning against landing on Europa: "All these worlds are yours, except Europa, attempt no landing there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This literary work, published in 1982, highlighted the early suspicion that Europa might offer the best chance of finding alien life within our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Challenges of Exploring Europa

Despite the intrigue, exploring Jupiter's moons, particularly Europa, presents significant [[challenges_of_exploring_jupiters_moons | challenges]] due to Jupiter's extreme environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Jupiter's Intense Magnetic Field
Jupiter possesses an incredibly powerful magnetic field, generated by metallic liquid hydrogen deep within the planet, which is nearly 20,000 times stronger than Earth's at the same distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. If visible from Earth, this magnetic field would appear twice as large as the full moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Radiation Belts
While the magnetic field itself is harmless, it traps particles ejected from Io, Jupiter's most volcanically active moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Io's volcanoes spew tons of sulfur dioxide, with one ton becoming ionized and trapped in Jupiter's magnetic field every second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. These particles are accelerated to over 300 kilometers per second, forming massive radiation belts that extend past Europa and other Jovian moons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

This intense radiation is detrimental to electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The Pioneer 10 and Voyager missions in the 1970s experienced glitches, false commands, and corrupted data during their brief flybys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Even with modern shielding, a spacecraft within these belts would only survive for about three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### [[NASAs Europa Clipper Mission | Europa Clipper]] Mitigation Strategy
[[NASAs Europa Clipper Mission | NASA's Europa Clipper mission]], launched in October 2024, is designed to overcome these [[challenges_of_exploring_jupiters_moons | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Instead of orbiting Europa directly, it will orbit Jupiter from a distance, making 49 rapid flybys of Europa over four years to collect data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This strategy allows the spacecraft to transmit data back to Earth during its "downtime" away from the intense radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The mission is named after 19th-century clipper ships, known for their speed and agility in navigating ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Evidence for a Subsurface Ocean
Europa's potential for life lies in the strong evidence suggesting a vast liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Lack of Craters
When Voyager 1 imaged Europa in 1979, scientists noted a striking absence of impact craters compared to most other moons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This suggests that a recent geological process, occurring within the last 60 million years, has resurfaced the moon, erasing most of its craters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Induced Magnetic Field
In 1995, the Galileo mission, which studied Jupiter and its moons for eight years, detected an induced magnetic field on Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. As Jupiter rotates, its magnetic field wobbles because its magnetic poles are not aligned with its geographic poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This changing field induces a strong magnetic field on Europa, indicating the presence of an electrically conductive layer close to the surface, likely tens of kilometers deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Surface Composition
Europa's white surface is primarily covered in a thick crust of water ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Spectrometer observations of reddish-brown regions on the surface suggest the presence of hydrated salts, sulfuric acid, or even bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Experiments at JPL have shown that sea salt, when subjected to intense radiation, turns a similar brownish color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. These findings lead scientists to suspect a subsurface saltwater ocean up to 100 kilometers deep, containing twice as much water as Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This ocean would drive geological activity, constantly smoothing and renewing the moon's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## How Europa's Ocean Stays Liquid
Despite receiving only about 4% of the sunlight Earth gets, which keeps Europa's surface below -160 degrees Celsius, the ocean is believed to remain liquid due to internal heating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Tidal Flexing
Europa's orbit around Jupiter is not perfectly circular due to the orbital resonance with Io and Ganymede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Ganymede completes one orbit for every two by Europa and four by Io <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This resonance causes Io to pull Europa inward on one side of its orbit, while Ganymede pulls it outward on the other, making its orbit more eccentric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Jupiter's gravitational pull is stronger on Europa's closer side, causing the moon to be constantly stretched and squeezed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The friction generated by this tidal flexing of the entire moon is believed to produce enough heat to keep the subsurface ocean liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This effect is stronger closer to Jupiter, which explains Io's intense volcanic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. If an ocean exists, Europa would flex by 30 meters in amplitude, compared to only one meter without an ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This significant deflection would be detectable in gravity data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The presence of cycloid features, strange arcuate cracks on the surface, also supports the existence of an ocean, as they require a large amplitude of motion from tidal stresses to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Conditions for Life
If a liquid ocean exists, Europa could harbor life, potentially for billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Hydrothermal Vents
The tidal flexing could push magma closer to the seafloor, creating hydrothermal vents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. On Earth, these vents are oases for ocean life, thriving thousands of meters below the surface without sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Lifeforms here rely on unique bacteria that feed on minerals from the vents, using chemical energy (chemosynthesis) rather than solar energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Organisms could potentially use various chemical reactions (e.g., methane, carbon dioxide, sulfur) as fuel for their metabolism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. The search would focus on single-cell organisms rather than complex life forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### Radiation as a Fuel Source
Ironically, Jupiter's intense radiation might actually make Europa a better candidate for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. High-speed particles striking Europa's surface can provide enough energy to water and carbon dioxide molecules to form new compounds like formaldehyde or hydrogen peroxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. If these compounds can reach the subsurface ocean, they could serve as food for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Evidence of overturn in the icy shell at "chaos zones" suggests material could be shoved down into the icy shell and potentially into the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</sup>.

## Searching for Life: The Europa Clipper Mission
The [[NASAs Europa Clipper Mission | Europa Clipper]] will not drill through the kilometers-thick ice crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Instead, it will use various instruments to gather evidence.

### Plume Sampling
Images from the Cassini mission have shown water geysers erupting from Enceladus, a moon of Saturn also housing a subsurface ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The Hubble Space Telescope has also picked up evidence of similar geyser eruptions on Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. The hope is that Clipper could fly through one of these plumes, much like the SnotBot drone collects whale snot on Earth, to reveal their chemical composition using a mass spectrometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</sup>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

### Instruments and Future Missions
The [[NASAs Europa Clipper Mission | Europa Clipper]] carries several instruments:

Future missions, such as a lander, would be necessary to directly search for signs of life on Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Studies suggest a lander could survive on the surface for a month, allowing it to scoop up material from below the radiation-processed depth for analysis by a mass spectrometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</sup>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

## [[Collaborative Space Exploration Efforts | Collaborative Space Exploration Efforts]]
The [[NASAs Europa Clipper Mission | Europa Clipper]] will not be alone in the Jupiter system. The European Space Agency's JUICE mission (Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer) is already en route to Jupiter and will arrive about 15 months after Clipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. JUICE will perform a few flybys of Europa before settling into orbit around Ganymede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## Timeline and Significance
Distant observations from [[NASAs Europa Clipper Mission | Europa Clipper]] are expected to begin in 2030, with high-resolution data becoming available in 2031 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. The launch of the [[NASAs Europa Clipper Mission | Europa Clipper]], initially scheduled for October 10, 2024, was pending clear weather conditions in Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The mission represents the culmination of over 26 years of planning and research into Europa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

In the late 1990s, NASA even video-called Arthur C. Clarke to share plans for a future mission to Europa. After seeing the mission details, Clarke granted NASA permission to "land" on Europa, symbolically endorsing the scientific pursuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</sup>. The [[NASAs Europa Clipper Mission | Europa Clipper]] embodies the ambitious goals and [[Collaborative Space Exploration Efforts | collaborative efforts]] that drive space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

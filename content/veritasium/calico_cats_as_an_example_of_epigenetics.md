Inside every human cell, there are six feet of DNA, composed of six billion letters of genetic code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This DNA is organized into 46 pieces, each 3 to 4 cm long, known as [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While often depicted in an X-shape, chromosomes only adopt this form when a cell is preparing to divide; normally, DNA exists as a wiggly thread within the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

To manage the immense length of DNA (approximately 2 nanometers wide) within a chromosome (centimeters long), the DNA is wrapped around proteins called [[role_of_histones_in_dna_packing | histones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These histones possess "wiggly tails" which play a crucial role in gene regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Genetic Makeup and Sex Chromosomes

A unique set of DNA is formed when 23 [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosomes]] from one parent combine with 23 from the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. While 22 of these [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosomes]] from each parent form matching pairs, the 23rd set consists of the sex [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Two X [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosomes]] result in a female, whereas an X and a Y [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosome]] result in a male <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## [[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | X Chromosome Inactivation in Females]]

In males, both sex [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosomes]] can remain active throughout life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. However, in females, one of the X [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosomes]] must be inactivated for proper development to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This process of [[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | X chromosome inactivation]] begins when a female embryo is merely four days old and consists of only about 100 cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

During [[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | X chromosome inactivation]], one of the two active X [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosomes]] (one from each parent) is effectively "switched off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This silencing is achieved through several molecular mechanisms:
*   **DNA Packing:** The DNA on the inactivated X [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosome]] is packed more tightly together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_histones_in_dna_packing | Histone]] Modifications:** Modifications are made to the "dangly tails" of the [[role_of_histones_in_dna_packing | histone]] proteins around which the DNA is wrapped, signaling inactivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Structural Proteins:** New structural proteins are added to further bind everything closer together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Methyl Groups:** Tiny molecular markers called methyl groups are added directly to the DNA, signaling to the cell that this DNA should not be read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

These changes make the DNA on the inactivated X [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosome]] very difficult for molecular machinery to access, effectively silencing its genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. In contrast, the active X [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosome]]'s DNA remains more spread out, allowing better access to its genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This accessibility allows RNA polymerase to access and transcribe DNA into messenger RNA, which is then used to make proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Randomness and Inheritance of Inactivation
A surprising aspect of [[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | X chromosome inactivation]] is its apparent randomness: in some cells, the X [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosome]] from the father wins and remains active, while in others, the mother's X [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosome]] prevails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This results in the 100-cell embryo having a mixture of active X [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Crucially, as these cells divide, they maintain the initial active X [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosome]] choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Consequently, all daughter cells will have the same X [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosome]] activated as their parent cell, continuing into adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Calico Cats: A Visible Example

While this "stripy pattern" of [[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | X chromosome inactivation]] is not visible in humans, it can be observed in Calico cats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The gene responsible for coat color in cats is located on the X [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. By examining the pattern of dark and light spots on a Calico cat, one can discern which X [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosome]] (from the mother or father) has been inactivated in different patches of cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

This phenomenon also explains why almost all Calico cats are female <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Only female cats can inherit two X [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosomes]], each potentially carrying a different coat color gene, allowing for the mosaic pattern that defines a Calico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Broader Implications of [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | Epigenetics]]

The [[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | inactivation of the X chromosome]] is a compelling example of [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | epigenetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | Epigenetics]] generally refers to mechanisms that turn genes on and off without altering the underlying DNA sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This process is active across all [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosomes]], regulating gene expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. For instance, [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | epigenetics]] ensures that a pancreatic cell can produce insulin by switching on the insulin gene in that specific cell type, while keeping it switched off elsewhere in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

Even more remarkably, [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | epigenetics]] can be influenced by an individual's behaviors, and perhaps even by the behaviors of their parents or grandparents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This means that individuals are not solely a product of their genetic code or DNA, but also a product of their [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | epigenetics]], which is shaped by their own actions and those of their ancestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

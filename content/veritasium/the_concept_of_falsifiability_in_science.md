The concept of falsifiability, or the ability of a statement, hypothesis, or theory to be proven false, is a cornerstone of the [[the_importance_of_disconfirming_evidence | scientific method]]. It emphasizes that true scientific progress comes not from confirming what we believe to be true, but from actively attempting to disprove our theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## The Number Sequence Game

To illustrate this principle, a game is presented where participants must deduce a hidden rule governing a sequence of three numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The initial sequence provided is 2, 4, 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Participants propose their own three-number sequences, to which the host responds "yes" (it follows the rule) or "no" (it doesn't) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### The Common Pitfall: Seeking Confirmation

Upon hearing 2, 4, 8, and then sequences like 16, 32, 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, 3, 6, 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, or 10, 20, 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, many players initially propose the rule "multiply by 2" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. While these sequences consistently received a "yes" response, this rule was incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The common tendency is to propose numbers that *confirm* an existing hypothesis, rather than those that might *disprove* it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Players often ask questions expecting a "yes" answer, which provides less information than a "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### The Breakthrough: Seeking Disconfirmation

The host encourages players to think strategically and seek "no" responses, as these are "much more informational" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. When a player proposed 10, 9, 8, the host finally said "does not follow the rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This single "no" provided the crucial insight.

The actual rule was simply "numbers in increasing order" or "numbers in ascending order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Any sequence like 1, 2, 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, 7, 8, 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, or even 2, 4, 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, fit the rule because they were in increasing order, regardless of the mathematical operation between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The initial sequences that fit the "multiply by 2" hypothesis also coincidentally fit the "increasing order" rule.

## The Black Swan Metaphor

This demonstration is inspired by Nassim Taleb's book *The Black Swan* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The black swan is a metaphor for the unknown and the unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Historically, people believed all swans were white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Every observation of a white swan seemed to confirm this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. However, the discovery of black swans in Australia disproved the theory, demonstrating that while many confirmations might make a theory seem "pretty good," it can never be definitively proven true by confirmation alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Application to Science and Life

The essence of falsifiability is that you can never truly *prove* a theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Instead, the [[the_importance_of_disconfirming_evidence | scientific method]] sets out to *disprove* theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It is only when a theory cannot be disproven, despite rigorous attempts, that it is considered to be getting at something "really true about our reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

This approach is beneficial beyond just scientific inquiry:
> "If you think that something is true you should try as hard as you can to disprove it. Only then can you really get at the truth and not fool yourself." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>

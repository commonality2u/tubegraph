On April 10th, 2019, the [[first_image_of_a_black_hole_by_event_horizon_telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]] released what was expected to be the first-ever image of a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The anticipated image was described as looking somewhat like a "fuzzy coffee mug stain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Significance of the Image

This image is profoundly significant because it allows scientists to test whether the general theory of relativity accurately predicts phenomena in the strong gravity regime, specifically around a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## What We See in the Image

### The Event Horizon and Schwarzschild Radius
The [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] is a spherical boundary around a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] from which nothing, not even light, can escape to an outside observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Once inside the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]], all paths lead to the singularity at the center of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The radius of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] is known as the [[Understanding event horizon and Schwarzschild radius | Schwarzschild radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

A [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] by itself would be impossible to image, as it absorbs all [[use_of_electromagnetic_waves_to_view_black_holes | electromagnetic radiation]] that falls on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. However, the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] observed by the [[first_image_of_a_black_hole_by_event_horizon_telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]], Sagittarius A* in the center of our Milky Way galaxy, has matter around it in an [[Accretion disk around a black hole | accretion disk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### The Accretion Disk
The [[Accretion disk around a black hole | accretion disk]] consists of incredibly hot dust and gas, swirling chaotically at millions of degrees and moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This matter is what the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] "feeds off" to grow larger over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The [[Accretion disk around a black hole | accretion disk]] does not extend all the way to the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]]. This is because there's an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. For matter around a non-spinning [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]], this orbit is at three [[Understanding event horizon and Schwarzschild radius | Schwarzschild radii]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. If matter goes inside this orbit, it quickly falls into the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]]'s center <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### The Photon Sphere
Light, having no mass, can orbit closer to the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] than matter, specifically at 1.5 [[Understanding event horizon and Schwarzschild radius | Schwarzschild radii]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This region is known as the photon sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. While theoretical, if one could stand there, they could see the back of their own head as photons complete an orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The photon sphere is an unstable orbit; photons eventually either spiral into the singularity or spiral out to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### The Black Hole "Shadow"
The apparent "shadow" in a [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] image is not simply the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] or the photon sphere directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] warps [[how_light_behaves_around_black_holes | spacetime]], causing light rays to curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

*   Light rays that cross the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] are absorbed, creating a dark region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   Even light rays coming in just above the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]], or even at the distance of the photon sphere, can be bent and eventually fall into the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   To avoid falling in, a light ray must originate at least 2.6 [[Understanding event horizon and Schwarzschild radius | Schwarzschild radii]] away from the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Such a ray would just graze the photon sphere at its closest approach before heading off to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

The resulting "shadow" is approximately 2.6 times larger than the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. While the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] is at the center of this shadow, [[how_light_behaves_around_black_holes | light rays]] bending around the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] mean that observers can effectively see the entire backside of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] mapped onto a ring within the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. In fact, due to the extreme bending of [[how_light_behaves_around_black_holes | light]], there are effectively infinite images of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | event horizon]] as one approaches the edge of this shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The "first light" that can be seen consists of those rays that graze the photon sphere before reaching telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Viewing Angle and Relativistic Beaming
The appearance of the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] image can also change based on the observer's angle relative to the [[Accretion disk around a black hole | accretion disk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Due to the warping of [[how_light_behaves_around_black_holes | spacetime]], observers can even see the back of the [[Accretion disk around a black hole | accretion disk]], as [[how_light_behaves_around_black_holes | light rays]] bend over or under the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] to reach our telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This effect can create the illusion of the [[Accretion disk around a black hole | accretion disk]] wrapping around the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

An additional important effect is [[Relativistic beaming and plasma orbiting black holes | relativistic beaming]] (or Doppler beaming) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Because the matter in the [[Accretion disk around a black hole | accretion disk]] moves at speeds close to that of light, the side of the disk moving towards the observer will appear much brighter than the side moving away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This phenomenon results in a bright spot within the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Observing the image over time to track blobs of matter moving around the [[black_holes_and_event_horizons | black hole]] could provide further exciting insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

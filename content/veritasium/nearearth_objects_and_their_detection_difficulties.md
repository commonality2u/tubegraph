On February 15, 2013, an asteroid, heavier than the Eiffel Tower, entered Earth's atmosphere over Chelyabinsk, Russia, and exploded 30 kilometers above the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This event was brighter than the sun but silent for 90 seconds, leading to increased devastation as people looked through windows before the shockwave hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The shockwave damaged thousands of buildings and injured 1500 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The [[chelyabinsk_asteroid_event | Chelyabinsk asteroid event]] was particularly concerning because, on the same day, scientists had predicted a close fly-by of Earth by another asteroid, Duende, which occurred 16 hours later, coming within 27,000 kilometers of Earth's surface (closer than geosynchronous satellites) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. However, they completely missed the unrelated [[chelyabinsk_asteroid_event | Chelyabinsk asteroid event]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Since 1988, over 1200 asteroids larger than a meter have [[impact_of_asteroids_on_earth | collided with the earth]], yet only five were detected before [[impact_of_asteroids_on_earth | impact]], never with more than a day of warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Origin and Characteristics of Asteroids

Asteroids are leftover debris from the formation of our solar system 4.5 billion years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. During planetary formation, rocks and dust clumped into molten protoplanets, where heavy elements like iron, nickel, and iridium sank to the core, leaving lighter silicate minerals on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Many of these protoplanets collided, breaking into pieces that continued orbiting the sun, further fragmenting into the asteroids we see today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This explains why some are rocky rubble piles, while others, originating from cores of planetesimals, are mostly metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. An iron meteorite, for example, is a piece of the core of a small planetary body that was smashed apart by another asteroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Most asteroids maintain stable orbits within the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. However, some have orbits that bring them closer to Earth; these are known as Near Earth Objects (NEOs) and pose a significant threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Stephen Hawking considered an asteroid [[impact_of_asteroids_on_earth | impact]] to be the greatest threat to life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Difficulties in Detecting Asteroids

Detecting asteroids is challenging for several reasons:
*   **Small Size**: Asteroids range from meters to kilometers in size, making them difficult to spot in the vastness of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The [[chelyabinsk_asteroid_event | Chelyabinsk meteor]] was only about 20 meters in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Darkness**: Asteroids are rough and dark, reflecting only about 15% of the light that hits them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This means they are best seen when fully illuminated by the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Opposition Effect (Blind Spot)**: Over 85% of detected near-Earth asteroids are found in the 45 degrees of sky directly opposite the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This "opposition effect" implies many undetected NEOs and potentially hazardous asteroids, especially those approaching from the direction of the sun, like the one in the [[chelyabinsk_asteroid_event | Chelyabinsk asteroid event]], which are effectively invisible to ground-based telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Orbital Prediction Challenges

Even after an asteroid is detected, predicting its trajectory is difficult:
*   **Limited Data**: Initial observations over only a few days are insufficient to accurately predict an asteroid's path far into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Years of observations are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Gravitational Influence**: Asteroids are not solely orbiting the sun; the gravitational pull of all planets significantly influences and changes their orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Dynamical Chaos**: This effect means that after a certain amount of time, the asteroid's exact position becomes unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. In practice, predictions cannot be made more than 100 years into the future with any accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

Currently, one million asteroids have been detected and cataloged, with 24,000 identified as near-Earth objects requiring close monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Impact Consequences and Remaining Threats

The [[impact_of_asteroids_on_earth | impact of asteroids]] can be catastrophic. Barringer Crater in Arizona, formed 50,000 years ago by a 50-meter asteroid (only slightly larger than [[chelyabinsk_asteroid_event | Chelyabinsk]]), released energy equivalent to 10 megatons of TNT, 600 times that of the Hiroshima bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. A high-speed impact vaporizes the projectile, turning it into hot, high-pressure gas that explodes and forms the crater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This means a meteorite [[impact_of_asteroids_on_earth | impact]] closely resembles a large [[nuclear_weapons_detection | nuclear explosion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

The dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago by a 10-kilometer asteroid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Asteroids above a critical size (likely a couple of kilometers) can have a global [[effects_on_earth_and_astronomical_bodies | effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Such an [[impact_of_asteroids_on_earth | impact]] would launch debris into sub-orbital trajectories, causing it to fall back to Earth everywhere, even on the opposite side of the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. This would cause the sky to light up with "wall-to-wall meteors," turning it into a red, hot glow, akin to being inside a toaster oven, effectively cooking everything on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Only animals living underground or in water would have a chance to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

While the probability of a 10-kilometer asteroid [[impact_of_asteroids_on_earth | impact]] (like the dinosaur extinction event) occurring in a human lifetime is statistically zero for the next 100 years, as no such asteroids are on an intersecting path with Earth, smaller asteroids pose a more immediate threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. There are exponentially more smaller asteroids; for every 10-kilometer asteroid, there are roughly a thousand 1-kilometer asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

*   **1-2 Kilometer Asteroids**: Capable of causing massive local damage, equivalent to obliterating a country the size of France or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. While about 98% of these have been identified and their orbits tracked for reasonable short-term predictions, some are still missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Hundred-Meter Asteroids**: This size range represents possibly the greatest remaining asteroid threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Many are still undetected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. An asteroid of this size is large enough to obliterate a major city, causing buildings to collapse, city-wide fires, and high-speed ejecta that would devastate a hundred-kilometer zone around the [[impact_of_asteroids_on_earth | impact]] site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Such an event "could happen tomorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## Current Limitations and Future Strategies

Currently, there are no effective [[current_and_potential_asteroid_deflection_strategies | current and potential asteroid deflection strategies]] for kilometer-sized or larger asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. Options considered and deemed unfeasible with current technology include:
*   **Bombing**: Detonating a [[nuclear_weapons_detection | nuclear explosion]] on or within an asteroid might break it up, but gravity would likely pull the fragments back together into a rubble pile, which is difficult to manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Nudging with Rockets**: Attaching rockets to gently push an asteroid off course would require them to remain attached for centuries to have a significant effect, which is beyond current capabilities for a rotating body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Laser Ablation**: Using lasers to boil the surface of an asteroid to create thrust is not possible from Earth due to insufficient power, and transporting such lasers to the asteroid is even more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Wrapping in Foil**: The idea of wrapping an asteroid in reflective foil to change its radiative properties and nudge its orbit is theoretically sound but practically impossible with current launch capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

Evacuation of a city is also highly problematic due to infrastructure limitations, as freeways would instantly become blocked by millions of people attempting to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

The most crucial step is to improve detection capabilities:
> "Let's do the thing that we can do first. So let's look for them. Let's do the surveys. Let's build the telescopes. Let's put this telescope in space. That will be a major contribution to understanding the threat from the asteroids. And then when we find a particular object that looks especially dangerous, then we can focus on it. We can focus everything we have on it, and we can begin to think seriously and with real motivation about ways to deflect it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>

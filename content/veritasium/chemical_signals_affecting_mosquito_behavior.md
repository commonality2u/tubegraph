Mosquitoes are known to be more attracted to some people than others, a phenomenon at least partially [[genetic_factors_influencing_mosquito_attraction | genetic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The precise mechanisms by which [[genetic_factors_influencing_mosquito_attraction | genetic differences]] influence mosquito attraction are not fully understood, but it is likely connected to the specific odors or volatile chemicals bodies give off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.

## Attractants

Mosquitoes utilize various chemical signals to locate their hosts.

### Human Odor and Volatiles
Mosquito attraction is likely related to the odor or volatile chemicals given off by human bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. The microbiome, specifically the bacteria on human skin, also plays a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

### Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
One of the primary signals mosquitoes follow is carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. Factors that increase CO2 output, such as a higher metabolism, recent exercise, being a larger person, or pregnancy, make an individual more likely to attract mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.

### Other Volatile Compounds
Mosquitoes are also attracted to other volatile compounds produced by humans, including lactic acid, acetone, and ammonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

### Disease-Induced Changes
Intriguingly, if a person contracts malaria, the disease actually alters their body chemistry to make them produce an odor that increases their attractiveness to mosquitoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. This suggests that the malaria parasite has [[role_of_evolution_in_human_attractiveness_to_mosquitoes | evolved]] to make its host more attractive to mosquitoes, which are the primary transmitters of malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

## Repellents and Impairing Chemicals

Scientists have identified certain chemicals that naturally repel mosquitoes or appear to hinder their ability to find humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. These naturally occurring compounds include:
*   Octanal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>
*   Nonanal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>
*   Decanal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>
*   6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>

## Research Methods

The "Y-tube test" is a common method used to assess mosquito attraction to chemical signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. In this setup, mosquitoes are placed in a holding chamber and presented with two arms of a Y-shaped tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. A fan induces a draft, and a "bait"—such as a human hand—is inserted into one chamber, while the other serves as a control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Rubbing the hand to get sweat and oils is recommended to maximize the chemical signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. The proportion of mosquitoes that choose the arm with the bait indicates the level of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This test was instrumental in discovering the partially [[genetic_factors_influencing_mosquito_attraction | genetic basis]] of mosquito attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

## Significance

Understanding the chemical signals that influence mosquito behavior is crucial because, among all animals, [[mosquitoes_and_their_impact_on_human_health | mosquitoes have the greatest impact on human health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. They are considered the most dangerous animal in the world, responsible for more deaths than any other single cause, including illnesses like malaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. This year alone, over a million people are expected to die from mosquito-borne illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

As the sun rose on July 2nd, 1937, Amelia Earhart found herself in a dire situation over the Pacific Ocean, with gas running low and unable to establish clear radio communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Her predicament stemmed from a series of unfortunate events and decisions, many of which could have been avoided with a better understanding of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Attempt to Circumnavigate the Globe

Amelia Earhart aimed to be the first female pilot to fly around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Unlike previous circumnavigations that followed a northern route close to land, Earhart's chosen path was the longest, hugging the Equator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This meant the final and most challenging leg of her journey was crossing the vast Pacific Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Her starting point for this crossing was Lae, New Guinea, a bustling airport hub at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. To achieve the necessary range, Earhart stripped her Lockheed Electra plane of all unnecessary weight, including insulation, which made engine noise overwhelming and necessitated written notes for communication with her navigator, [[role_and_impact_of_fred_noonan_in_earharts_journey | Fred Noonan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. She minimized personal belongings and replaced passenger seats with additional fuel tanks, effectively transforming the plane into a "flying gas can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Even with these modifications, the Electra's maximum range of 6,600 to 7,200 kilometers in perfect weather meant she could fall disastrously short of Hawaii from Lae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Howland Island: A Crucial Stopover

Earhart required a refueling stop along the route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Howland Island, a tiny speck of land just over two kilometers long and less than one kilometer wide, located halfway between Australia and Hawaii, was identified as an ideal location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The U.S. had claimed it under the Guano Islands Act of 1856, but in 1937, it was sparsely inhabited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Earhart's fame, garnered from achievements like becoming the first female passenger to cross the Atlantic by airplane in 1928 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> and her solo Atlantic flight in 1932 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, gave her influence. She leveraged her connections, including with First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, to lobby President Roosevelt to approve funds for a runway on Howland Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Her direct appeal led to the project's approval four days later, and three runways were soon cleared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Navigation Methods and Challenges

With a place to land, the challenge became finding this minute island in the vast Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. [[role_and_impact_of_fred_noonan_in_earharts_journey | Fred Noonan]], her navigator, utilized two primary methods:

*   **Dead Reckoning**: This involved calculating the flight plan using the onboard compass for bearing, air speed adjusted for wind to determine ground speed, and estimated time to reach the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. To account for drift, they would intentionally aim north or south of the island and then turn to intercept it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. A critical variable was wind speed; a stronger headwind, which Earhart was warned about but did not acknowledge, would mean a longer flight time and later turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Celestial Navigation**: As an independent check, Noonan would take measurements of the sun, moon, and stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. By measuring the angle above the horizon to navigation stars and referencing an almanac, he could trace circles on the globe to pinpoint their location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. However, small errors could accumulate over long trips, as experienced during their Atlantic crossing when they missed their intended airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Radio Support and Physics of Radio Waves

To further aid navigation, Earhart commandeered three U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships: the Itasca at Howland Island, the Ontario midway, and the Swan between Howland and Hawaii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. All ships were equipped with radio, a relatively new technology in 1937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Heinrich Hertz's discovery of radio waves in the late 1880s showed them to be transverse waves with electric and magnetic fields oscillating perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Hertz initially doubted their practical application, but within years, radio was used for sending messages and by the 1920s, for entertainment broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

Earhart's plane had five radio antennas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>:
*   A 76-meter long trailing antenna for efficient Morse code transmission and reception via 400-500 kilohertz radio waves, necessary for ship communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   Two antennas for voice communications on higher frequencies: a transmitting V antenna on the roof and a receiving antenna along the belly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Higher frequencies allowed for smaller antennas and long-distance travel by bouncing off the ionosphere, a layer of ions and free electrons in the atmosphere. This "skipping" effect reflects radio waves back to Earth, enabling multiple hops over thousands of kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. During the day, higher frequencies (e.g., 6210 kilohertz) were used due to the ionosphere's lower position, while lower frequencies (e.g., 3105 kilohertz) were used at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   A loop antenna and a sense antenna for radio direction finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. By rotating the loop antenna to find a "null" (where the signal drops out), the direction to the radio source could be determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. The sense antenna provided a cardioid pickup pattern, eliminating the ambiguity of two nulls, thus indicating whether the source was ahead or behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

## Communication Breakdown and Missed Opportunities

Four hours into the flight, Earhart reported her status on 6210 kHz but did not acknowledge Lae's warnings about stronger headwinds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Her inability to receive voice messages suggested an impairment, possibly a broken or detached belly antenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

Nine hours in, Earhart expected to contact the Ontario, but her urgent telegram requesting them to transmit Morse code Ns 10 minutes after each hour did not reach the ship in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. As Earhart couldn't communicate with the Ontario, they never sent signals, and the plane passed them without detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

This second attempt at circumnavigation followed a previous failed attempt in March 1937, where her plane crashed during takeoff in Hawaii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. During repairs, the seasonal winds shifted, necessitating an eastbound flight, and importantly, Harry Manning, an expert in radio and navigation who had assisted in the successful Hawaii flight, left the crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Earhart, now accompanied only by [[role_and_impact_of_fred_noonan_in_earharts_journey | Fred Noonan]], had also removed the long trailing antenna, considering it "dead weight" after Manning's departure, leaving her unable to transmit on lower frequencies like 500 kilohertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

## The Final Approach to Howland Island

Around 6:15 a.m. local time, Earhart contacted the Itasca, requesting a bearing on 3105 kHz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. The Itasca was confused, expecting Earhart to take a bearing on *them* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. Their radio direction finding equipment required lower frequencies (270-550 kilohertz); Earhart's voice frequency would skip off the ionosphere, scattering the signal and making a null reading impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

Further complicating matters were time zone differences: Earhart used Greenwich Civil Time, while the Itasca used GCT -11.5 hours, and Howland Island used Hawaii Time (GCT -10.5 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. This led to misinterpretations of scheduled transmission times.

Earhart had mistakenly requested the Itasca to transmit Morse code A on 7,500 kilohertz, instead of the intended 750 meters or 400 kilohertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. Despite explicitly asking if frequencies were "unsuitable," no one corrected her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. Commander Thompson of the Itasca, aware of Earhart's actual radio direction finding limits (200-1,500 kilohertz), opted not to intervene, believing it wasn't his place to make suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.

At 7:42 a.m., Earhart's clear voice reported, "We must be on you but cannot see you. Gas is running low. Been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a> Ten minutes later, she requested they transmit on 7,500 kHz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. The Itasca complied, but Earhart's loop antenna could not find a null because the high-frequency waves were skipping and reflecting, arriving from multiple directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Joseph Gurr, a radio mechanic on her plane, later confirmed awareness of high frequencies' tendency to skip and create false bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.

The Itasca attempted to explain that taking a bearing on her voice was impractical, but without her belly antenna, Earhart likely never heard their messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. Her loop was also tuned to 7,500 kHz, meaning low-frequency signals from the Itasca would not have helped anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.

Just before 9:00 a.m., Earhart's final desperate message was received by the Itasca: "We are on the line 157-337. We will repeat this on 6,210 kilohertz. We are running on line north and south." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>

## Disappearance and Search Efforts

[[conspiracy_theories_and_search_efforts_for_earhart | Conspiracy theories regarding Earhart's disappearance]] exist, but the prevailing evidence suggests she ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. Two hours after her last message, the Itasca began a search, joined by other Navy and Coast Guard ships and planes for over two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>. This became the most intensive and expensive search and rescue operation in U.S. history up to that point, costing approximately $4 million (nearly $100 million in today's money) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. No trace of Earhart, [[role_and_impact_of_fred_noonan_in_earharts_journey | Noonan]], or the Electra was ever found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

Many factors contributed to the disaster. If Earhart had maintained two-way communication, particularly if her belly antenna hadn't malfunctioned, issues could have been resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. If she had switched to using her loop antenna for all communications, she could have received Itasca's voice messages, allowing the ship to request a bearing on a lower frequency and guide her safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. The story highlights a critical interplay of knowledge and responsibility: Earhart lacked the technical understanding of radio systems, while Commander Thompson, possessing that knowledge, did not assume the responsibility to correct her critical frequency error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

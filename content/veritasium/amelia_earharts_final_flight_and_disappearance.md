As the sun rose on July 2nd, 1937, Amelia Earhart found herself in a dire situation over the Pacific Ocean. Over the radio, she transmitted, "We must be on you but cannot see you. Gas is running low. Been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Surrounded by water, her predicament stemmed from a series of unfortunate events and [[challenges_and_decision_making_in_earharts_aviation_attempts | bad decisions]], many of which could have been avoided with a better understanding of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The World Flight Attempt

Amelia Earhart aimed to become the first female pilot to fly around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Unlike previous successful circumnavigations that followed a northern route close to land, Earhart's chosen path was the longest, closely following the Equator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This meant the final and most challenging part of her journey was crossing the vast Pacific Ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

She departed from Lae, a bustling airport on the eastern side of New Guinea, on what would be her final flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Given that most planes in 1937 could only fly a few thousand kilometers, Earhart meticulously stripped her Lockheed Electra plane of unnecessary weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. She removed insulation, making engine noise so overwhelming that she had to communicate with her navigator, Fred Noonan, via written notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Passenger seats were replaced with fuel tanks, effectively transforming the plane into a "flying gas can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Even with these modifications, the Electra's maximum range was 6,600 to 7,200 kilometers in perfect weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, barely enough to reach Hawaii from Lae.

## Howland Island: A Crucial Stop

To refuel, Earhart needed a stopover point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Howland Island, a tiny, barely inhabited US territory just over two kilometers long and less than one kilometer wide, was strategically located halfway between Australia and Hawaii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Earhart leveraged her fame, gained from being the first female passenger to cross the Atlantic by airplane in 1928 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> and her solo Atlantic flight in 1932 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. She successfully lobbied President Roosevelt to approve funds for constructing runways on Howland Island, crucial for her world flight attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Three runways were subsequently cleared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Navigation Techniques

Finding the tiny Howland Island in the vast Pacific required multiple navigation methods:

### Dead Reckoning
Fred Noonan, her navigator, would calculate the flight plan using dead reckoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This involved knowing the direction of Howland (using an onboard compass), air speed, ground speed (by accounting for wind), and then calculating the time needed to reach the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. To avoid uncertainty, they would aim for a point either north or south of the island and then turn towards it after the calculated travel time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

However, dead reckoning was susceptible to errors. Just 20 minutes after takeoff, Lae radioed Earhart to warn of stronger headwinds than initially estimated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Earhart did not acknowledge this message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, which was critical as wind speed directly impacted travel time and turn calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Celestial Navigation
As an independent check, Noonan would take measurements of the sun, moon, and stars, a method known as celestial navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Using an almanac, he could determine his position by measuring the angle of navigation stars above the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This allowed him to trace circles of possible locations on the globe, with the intersection of two such circles pinpointing their approximate position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. While useful for continually updating their location, errors could still accumulate over long trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Earlier in their journey, during the Atlantic crossing, small errors led them to miss their intended airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Radio Navigation and Direction Finding
For the Pacific crossing, Earhart commandeered three US Navy and Coast Guard ships: the Itasca (at Howland Island), the Ontario (halfway), and the Swan (between Howland and Hawaii) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. These ships were equipped with [[radio_communication_and_navigation_techniques_in_the_1930s | radio]] for communication and direction finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Earhart's plane was fitted with five radio antennas:
*   **Long trailing antenna**: 76 meters long, used for efficient Morse code transmission and reception via 400-500 kilohertz [[radio_communication_and_navigation_techniques_in_the_1930s | radio waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This antenna was crucial for long-distance signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Transmitting V antenna (roof)** and **Receiving antenna (belly)**: For voice communications on higher frequencies (e.g., 6210 kilohertz during the day, 3105 kilohertz at night) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Higher frequencies require smaller antennas and can travel long distances by "skipping" or bouncing off the ionosphere, a layer of ions and free electrons in the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Loop antenna** and **Sense antenna**: These were designed for radio direction finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. A loop antenna works by detecting the changing magnetic field of [[radio_communication_and_navigation_techniques_in_the_1930s | radio waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. When the loop is perpendicular to the direction of the wave's magnetic field oscillation, it receives a "null" reading (no signal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. Earhart would turn the loop until she found this null, indicating the direction *to* or *away* from the ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. The sense antenna was used to resolve this 180-degree ambiguity, creating a cardioid pickup pattern with a single null, thus indicating whether the source was in front or behind the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. This was considered the most critical navigation aid for locating Howland Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

## Communication Failures and Misunderstandings

Several [[technical_failings_and_their_impact_on_earharts_mission | technical failings]] and misunderstandings plagued the flight:

### Initial Contact Problems
Four hours after takeoff, Earhart radioed Lae on her daytime frequency (6210 kHz) reporting her altitude and speed, but never acknowledged Lae's warnings about stronger headwinds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. It's likely her receiving belly antenna was impaired or broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

### Missing the Ontario
Nine hours into the flight, Earhart expected to hear Morse code Ns from the Ontario on 400 kHz, but heard nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Earhart had sent an urgent telegram asking the Ontario to transmit frequently, but it didn't reach the ship in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Since Earhart couldn't communicate her request to them, they never sent signals, and the plane and ship "passed like ships in the night" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

### The First Attempt and Crew Change
This was Earhart's second attempt at circumnavigation. In March 1937, her first attempt ended when her plane drifted right during takeoff from Hawaii, causing the landing gear to collapse and the plane to skid on its belly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. The Electra took months to repair, and seasonal winds shifted, necessitating an east-to-west flight path for the next attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. Critically, Captain Harry Manning, an expert in radio and traditional navigation, left the crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. Earhart subsequently removed the long trailing antenna, which was used for Morse code, as she and Noonan were not particularly well-versed in it, seeing it as "dead weight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. This proved to be a critical [[technical_failings_and_their_impact_on_earharts_mission | technical failing]] as it prevented her from transmitting on lower frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

## Final Approach and Confusion with the Itasca

Approaching Howland, Earhart had to make the critical [[challenges_and_decision_making_in_earharts_aviation_attempts | decision]] to continue or turn back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. She knew the Itasca at Howland would be transmitting Morse code A every half hour and could send/receive voice signals on various frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

Around 6:15 a.m. local time, Itasca radiomen heard Earhart clearly: "Please take a bearing on 3105. We'll whistle into the mic. We are about 200 miles out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. The Itasca crew were confused, expecting Earhart to take a bearing on *them* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. Their direction-finding equipment required lower frequencies (270-550 kHz); Earhart's voice frequency (3105 kHz) would skip off the ionosphere and scatter, making direction finding impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Earhart's expected Adcock antenna array, which could solve the skipping problem for high frequencies, was too massive and only installed at larger airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

A portable high-frequency [[radio_communication_and_navigation_techniques_in_the_1930s | radio]] direction finder *was* on Howland, but its operator reported Earhart's transmissions were too short for a bearing and he missed parts due to conserving battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

### Time Zone Discrepancy
Another significant issue was a time zone confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. Earhart was using Greenwich Civil Time (GCT), while the Itasca used GCT -11.5 hours, and Howland Island used Hawaii Time (GCT -10.5 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. This meant when Earhart said "on the half hour," likely referring to 15 minutes away in her GCT schedule, the Itasca interpreted it as "in a half hour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. This resulted in them transmitting at the same time, blocking each other's messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

### The 7,500 Kilohertz Error
Crucially, Earhart had made a terrible mistake in relaying her plan to the Itasca. She requested the signal be sent on 7,500 kilohertz, instead of 750 meters (which is 400 kilohertz), a frequency suitable for her loop antenna's direction-finding capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. Despite explicitly asking to be informed if frequencies were "unsuitable," no one corrected her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

At 7:42 a.m., Earhart's voice came through, stating, "We must be on you but cannot see you. But gas is running low. Been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. When she requested, "Go ahead on 7,500," the Itasca complied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. In the Electra, Earhart heard the Morse code, but when she turned her loop antenna, "the signal never dropped out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. The frequency was too high; the [[radio_communication_and_navigation_techniques_in_the_1930s | radio waves]] were reflecting and arriving from multiple directions, making it impossible to find a precise null for direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

## Disappearance and Aftermath

Earhart frantically called the Itasca, "We received your signals but unable to get a minimum. Please take a bearing on us and answer with voice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. The Itasca tried to explain, "Your signals received okay. It is impractical to take a bearing on your voice," but Earhart likely never heard them without her functional belly antenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

Commander Thompson of the Itasca knew Earhart's radio direction finding limits (200-1,500 kHz) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>, but he did not correct her 7,500 kHz request, believing she knew her equipment better or it wasn't his [[role_of_responsibility_and_knowledge_in_earharts_journey | place to make suggestions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.

Just before 9:00 a.m., Earhart's voice came through for the last time, sounding desperate: "We are on the line 157-337. We will repeat this on 6,210 kilohertz. We are running on line north and south" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

Earhart's plane ran out of fuel somewhere over the Pacific and crashed into the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. A massive search and rescue operation, costing around $4 million (nearly $100 million in 2023), was launched for over two weeks, but no trace of Earhart, Noonan, or the Electra was ever found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

## Conclusion

The disaster was not inevitable. Many factors contributed to the loss, primarily stemming from a lack of [[role_of_responsibility_and_knowledge_in_earharts_journey | knowledge]] and [[role_of_responsibility_and_knowledge_in_earharts_journey | responsibility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. Earhart lacked the technical understanding of [[radio_communication_and_navigation_techniques_in_the_1930s | radio]] systems to specify the correct direction-finding frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. Conversely, Commander Thompson possessed that [[role_of_responsibility_and_knowledge_in_earharts_journey | knowledge]] but did not take the [[role_of_responsibility_and_knowledge_in_earharts_journey | responsibility]] to correct her or intervene with specific suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. This combination of factors, alongside [[technical_failings_and_their_impact_on_earharts_mission | technical failings]] like the presumed malfunction of the belly antenna and the removal of the trailing antenna, led to the tragic outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.

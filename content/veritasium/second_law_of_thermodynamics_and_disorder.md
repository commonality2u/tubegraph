From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

The [[entropy_and_the_second_law_of_thermodynamics | second law of thermodynamics]] states that everything in the universe tends towards [[entropy_and_the_second_law_of_thermodynamics | disorder]], and that in complex systems, chaos is the norm, leading one to naturally expect the universe to be messy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite this, instances of [[spontaneous_order_and_synchronization_in_nature | spontaneous order]] are observable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Examples include the synchronization of metronomes, the precisely timed orbits of moons, the simultaneous flashes of fireflies, and even the regular beating of the human heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. These phenomena raise the question of what imposes order despite nature's inherent tendency for [[entropy_and_the_second_law_of_thermodynamics | disorder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Millennium Bridge Wobble

When the Millennium Bridge in London opened, it began to wobble as crowds filled it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Police efforts to restrict access did not stop the wobble, and the bridge, which cost 18 million pounds, was fully closed two days later, not reopening for another two years <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

The danger of synchronized movement on bridges has been known for a long time; armies have been advised to break step when crossing bridges since an accident in 1831 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. In that incident, 74 men from the 60th Rifle Corps were marching across the Broughton suspension bridge in northern England when it collapsed under their synchronized footsteps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Sixty men fell into the river, with 20 suffering injuries, though luckily no one was killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Following this, the British Army mandated that all troops break step when crossing bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Despite being random members of the public, most people walking across the Millennium Bridge were walking in step with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The question arose: why did a modern bridge, designed for heavy pedestrian traffic, fail to handle this? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

## Early Observations of Synchronization

### Huygens' Pendulum Clocks

In 1656, Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens created the first working pendulum clock, aiming to help sailors determine their longitude at sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Latitude could be found by measuring the sun or stars, but longitude required knowing the time at a fixed location like a home port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Existing clocks were too inaccurate, routinely off by about 15 minutes a day, rendering them useless for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Huygens' pendulum clocks, by contrast, were accurate to within 10 to 15 seconds per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

Huygens' plan for shipboard use involved attaching two clocks to a heavy hanging mass to prevent them from being affected by rolling seas, with two clocks providing a backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. While testing this setup at home in February 1665, he made a remarkable discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. His clocks, hung from a wooden beam across chairs, would spontaneously synchronize after about half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. When one pendulum swung one way, the other would swing the opposite way; as one ticked, the other talked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Even when he deliberately set them out of sync, they would return to lockstep within 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Huygens initially believed this "strange sympathy" was due to air currents between the pendulums and placed a board between them, but the clocks continued to sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. He realized the synchrony disappeared when the clocks were separated but returned when they were brought back together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. He concluded that the clocks synchronized because they were hung from the same wooden beam, which transferred mechanical vibrations between them, effectively "coupling" the two oscillators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Huygens was the first to observe [[spontaneous_order_and_synchronization_in_nature | spontaneous synchronization]] in inanimate objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. A rigorous theory of synchronization only began to be fleshed out a few decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## How Synchronization Works

### Coupled Metronomes

A common demonstration involves placing several metronomes on a light, wobbly platform and starting them out of sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Even if the metronomes don't have exactly the same natural frequency, they will eventually beat in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. When two metronomes oscillate in sync, their large masses accelerate to the left, pushing the platform to the right, and vice-versa, keeping the system's center of mass roughly in the same spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. If another metronome starts out of sync, the platform's motion gives it a kick every half swing, speeding it up until it aligns with the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This mechanism works regardless of the number of metronomes, as the platform moves in the direction the majority of metronomes push it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### The Kuramoto Model

The state of an oscillator, like a metronome pendulum, can be represented as a point on a circle, indicating its phase in the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. For example, the rightmost point of a pendulum can be 0 degrees, and the leftmost 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. As the pendulum oscillates, the point moves around the circle, with higher frequency meaning faster movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. When oscillators are synchronized, their points move around the circle together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

The [[spontaneous_order_and_synchronization_in_nature | Kuramoto model]] is a mathematical model that illustrates this synchronizing behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. It posits that the rate at which each point moves around the circle equals its natural frequency plus an amount related to its distance from all other points, with the magnitude of this effect determined by the "coupling strength" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. An analogy is two friends running on a track: if the faster friend encourages the slower one, and the "coupling" (their friendship/effort) is strong enough, they can overcome their inherent speed difference and synchronize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. If the coupling isn't strong enough, one person will lap the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Fireflies and Phase Transitions

Fireflies in Southeast Asia demonstrate this phenomenon by synchronizing their flashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Although each firefly has its own preferred flash frequency, they couple strongly enough that hundreds, even thousands, can flash together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. In simulations, a firefly's internal clock is nudged forward if it sees a flash nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Even with small, short-range interactions, waves of flashes can travel through the group over time, eventually leading to all fireflies flashing at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Synchronization does not occur gradually with increasing coupling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Instead, it's like a phase transition, similar to how water suddenly freezes at a critical temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Once a critical level of coupling is surpassed, the oscillators "lock their phases in time," a phenomenon called synchronization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This can be observed spontaneously, for example, in an audience applauding after a performance, where individual claps transition into a synchronized rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Universality of Synchronization

[[spontaneous_order_and_synchronization_in_nature | Synchronization]] is a universal phenomenon, occurring at every scale of nature, from subatomic to cosmic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. It utilizes various communication channels, including gravitational, electrical, chemical, and mechanical interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### Moons and Orbital Resonance

Earth's moon, for example, is tidally locked, meaning it rotates on its axis exactly once for every orbit around the Earth, which is why only one side is ever seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This is a common effect in our solar system, with 34 moons tidally locked to their planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. The process involves a moon's gravitational attraction to its planet being stronger on the closer side, distorting the moon into an egg shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. As the moon orbits and rotates, these bulges swing out of alignment, and the planet's gravity constantly pulls them back, slowing the moon's rotation until it locks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. If a moon rotates too slowly, the same mechanism can speed it up until it locks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

Further examples in our solar system include Jupiter's three innermost moons—Io, Europa, and Ganymede—which are not only tidally locked but also in a 1:4 orbital resonance with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. For every orbit of Ganymede around Jupiter, Europa orbits twice, and Io orbits four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

### Oscillating Chemical Reactions

In the 1950s, Russian chemists sought a chemical reaction that would oscillate, like a chemical analog of a pendulum, changing colors repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Naively, this might seem impossible due to the principles of [[entropy_and_the_second_law_of_thermodynamics | thermodynamics]], which state that closed systems increase their [[entropy_and_the_second_law_of_thermodynamics | entropy]] over time and tend towards equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. However, there's no principle preventing a system from oscillating and damping out to equilibrium in an oscillatory way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Boris Belousov and later Anatol Zhabotinsky discovered such a reaction, now known as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This reaction can continue oscillating between colors for half an hour or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. A stirred BZ reaction demonstrates the collectivity of quadrillions of molecules all acting simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. If unstirred, in a petri dish, it reveals spiral waves or expanding target patterns of color moving through the liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The liquid itself isn't moving; these are chemical waves where concentrations change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

Strikingly, the same phenomenon of spiral waves of electrical excitation is seen in the heart, looking exactly like the chemical waves in the BZ reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This inspired Art Winfree, whose work on chemical reaction waves provided insight into cardiac arrhythmias, particularly ventricular fibrillation, the most deadly kind of arrhythmia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Winfree's observation of rotating spirals in hearts and chemistry led him to a theory about the cause of ventricular fibrillation and how to design gentler defibrillators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## The Dual Nature of Synchronization

While too little synchronization, as in a fibrillating heart, prevents blood pumping and leads to sudden death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, too much synchronization can also cause problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The wobbling Millennium Bridge, for instance, was due to "crowd synchrony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

The Millennium Bridge was designed uniquely with supporting cables running alongside it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Civil engineers know not to build a footbridge with a resonant frequency equal to the human walking frequency of two strides per second (2 Hz vertical) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. However, what they didn't know was the importance of half that frequency (1 Hz), which is the frequency of putting down one foot (e.g., the left foot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. When walking, people impart a small sideways force (about a tenth of their downward force) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Normally, this wouldn't matter as people walk at different paces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. But if the bridge's sideways resonant frequency is 1 Hz, as the Millennium Bridge's was, people can start it moving slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

After the bridge's closure, engineers tested it with increasing numbers of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. With 50 or 100 people, there was minimal motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. At 156 people, there was still no wobble, but with just 10 more people (166 total), the acceleration grew dramatically, and the bridge swayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. The system had undergone a phase transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

It turns out people don't like walking on a platform that's moving sideways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. They spread their legs apart to stabilize themselves and start walking in step with the bridge's sideways motion, adopting a "penguin gate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. So, it wasn't people walking in sync that caused the bridge to wobble; it was the wobbling bridge that caused people to walk in sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. This created a positive feedback loop: the crowd's motion caused more bridge movement, which caused more people to synchronize with the bridge, further driving its motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The problem was solved by decreasing the coupling strength through the installation of energy-dissipating dampers along the bridge, a repair that cost several million pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

## Complex Systems and Emergent Order

Science often relies on reductionism, breaking problems into smaller parts for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. While this has been highly successful, the great frontier in science today is understanding what happens when parts are put back together to understand the whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. This is the field of complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Understanding phenomena like the immune system, consciousness, or the economy is challenging because the whole often appears to be more than the sum of its parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. The study of [[spontaneous_order_and_synchronization_in_nature | synchronization]] is a key aspect of exploring how properties of the whole emerge from the properties of its interacting parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

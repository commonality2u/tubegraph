The kilogram, a fundamental unit of mass in the [[History and evolution of the kilogram definition | Système International d'Unités (SI units)]], has historically been defined by a physical artifact: the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK), affectionately known as Le Grand K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. However, the IPK's mass has proven unstable over time, diverging from its replicas, posing a significant problem for precise measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. To address this, scientists have explored [[Alternative approaches to defining the kilogram | alternative approaches]] to redefine the kilogram based on fundamental physical constants, moving away from a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. One promising method involves using a precisely sculpted silicon sphere to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then define the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

## The Silicon Sphere

This sphere, containing approximately 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms, is a marvel of precision engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
It is considered the roundest object in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. If this sphere were scaled to the size of the Earth, the difference between its highest "mountain" and lowest "valley" would be only about 14 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The raw material for the sphere was worth 1 million Euros, but after precise sculpting, it is deemed priceless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Its high cost is due to its purity, as it contains only one isotope of silicon, silicon-28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Why a Sphere?

A sphere is chosen for this purpose because it is a simple object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. By knowing its diameter, the entire dimensions of the object can be accurately characterized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Creation and Measurement

The process of creating this incredibly round sphere begins with an oversized sphere, about two millimeters larger in diameter than the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. It is then progressively ground finer and finer using abrasives, a process described as "massaging atoms" to control the shape at an atomic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

After creation, the sphere's diameter must be measured with extreme accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This is achieved using a laser measurement system where the sphere is placed in the center of a cavity, and a laser beam hits both sides, allowing for precise measurement of the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Redefining the Kilogram through Avogadro's Constant

The core idea behind using the silicon sphere is to count the number of atoms within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. While direct counting isn't possible, it can be calculated with high precision because the sphere is a perfect crystal of silicon with no voids or dislocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

By knowing the sphere's diameter, its volume can be determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Since the atom spacing in silicon is known to high precision, the total number of atoms in the sphere can be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This precise count allows for a redefinition of Avogadro's constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

Currently, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram (the number of atoms in twelve grams of carbon-12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. The new approach proposes to fix Avogadro's constant using the number of silicon atoms in the sphere, which would then define the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

If implemented, the official definition of the kilogram would state: "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. This redefinition would mean the kilogram is no longer tied to a physical object but to a fundamental concept, ensuring its stability even if the silicon spheres were lost or damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Complementary Approaches

This approach is complementary to another method of redefining the kilogram which involves fixing Planck's constant using a Watt Balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. Both approaches serve as checks on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. If both show good agreement and can reduce their uncertainties to about twenty micrograms, a redefinition of the kilogram could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>, making it an unchanging unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

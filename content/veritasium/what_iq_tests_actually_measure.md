In popular culture, IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is often considered an objective and rigorous measurement of intellectual ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, the question of what IQ tests truly measure is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Origins of Intelligence Testing

The concept of intelligence testing dates back hundreds of years, with a significant breakthrough occurring in 1904 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This marks a key point in the [[history_of_iq_tests | history of IQ tests]].

### Spearman's g-Factor
English psychologist Charles Spearman observed that students' grades in different subjects, like English and Math, showed a clear positive correlation; students who performed well in one subject also tended to do well in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. To explain this, Spearman proposed that each person possesses a level of **general intelligence**, which he called the **g-factor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This g-factor was conceptualized as the speed at which students could learn new material, recognize patterns, and think critically across subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

Spearman also introduced **subject-specific factors**, or **s-factors**, to account for the fact that correlations between subjects weren't perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. He believed that s-factors could be trained, but the g-factor was fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. His goal was to reliably measure this general intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### The Binet-Simon Test
Around the same time in France, Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon developed the Binet-Simon test to identify children needing additional educational support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This test involved 30 tasks, such as naming missing drawing elements, defining abstract terms, and repeating sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Performance was benchmarked against age groups to assign a "mental age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The intelligence quotient (IQ) was then calculated by dividing mental age by actual age and multiplying by 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This marked the birth of the IQ score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Standardization of IQ Tests
The Binet-Simon test was translated and brought to the U.S., where Lewis Terman standardized it using a large American sample, leading to the Stanford-Binet test, which was widely used for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:06:12]</a>. Other IQ tests developed with the shared goal of measuring the g-factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. These tests assess various mental abilities like memory, verbal, spatial, and numerical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. By averaging scores across multiple sections, the aim is to minimize subject-specific distortions and approximate the g-factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

To standardize scoring, raw scores are normalized so the mean IQ is 100 and the standard deviation is 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This scaling means that 68% of people have an IQ between 85 and 115, and only about 2% score over 130 or under 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Components of Modern IQ Tests

Modern IQ tests typically include different types of questions:
*   **Vocabulary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>: Identifying synonyms or antonyms for given words.
*   **Number Patterns** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>: Completing numerical sequences by identifying arithmetic or geometric progressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Raven's Progressive Matrices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>: Identifying patterns in visual matrices, often involving translational or rotational motion, missing symbols, or addition rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

These questions are completed under time pressure, often with only 10 to 30 seconds per question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## What IQ Tests *Actually* Measure Beyond g-Factor

While IQ tests aim to measure general intelligence, they are influenced by several other factors, leading to [[controversies_and_critici_of_iq_tests | controversies and criticisms of IQ tests]].

### Predictive Power
IQ scores have a surprising [[predictive_power_of_iq | predictive power of IQ]] for various life outcomes:
*   **Brain Size**: Higher IQ correlates with a larger brain size, with an estimated correlation of 0.33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **School Success**: IQ is a strong predictor of academic performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. A study found an IQ test at age 11 correlated with national school examination scores five years later at around 0.8, explaining two-thirds of the variation in exam marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Standardized tests like the [[sat_test_mistaken_question_analysis | SAT]], [[impact_of_errors_on_standardized_tests_like_the_sat | ACT]], and GRE are argued to be essentially IQ tests, correlating at around 0.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Job Success**: IQ can predict occupational success, particularly in technical or complex jobs, with correlations typically ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The U.S. military, for example, will not accept individuals with an IQ under 80 due to significantly higher failure and remedial training rates for those below this threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Longevity**: Studies show that higher IQ is associated with a lower risk of dying within a given timeframe. For every 15-point increase in IQ, individuals were 27% more likely to be alive at age 76 in one Scottish study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Income**: While IQ correlates with income (around 0.21), it explains only about 4.4% of the variance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. The relationship with net worth is even weaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Stability and Genetics
IQ appears fairly consistent over one's lifetime, with scores 80 years apart correlating at 0.5 to 0.6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. There is also evidence for a genetic basis to IQ, with identical twins showing a very strong correlation in scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. However, IQ is not entirely determined by genetics; studies suggest a 50/50 split between heritability and environment, or a range between 40% and 70% genetic influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### The Dark History and Misinterpretations
The use of IQ tests has a dark history, notably with Henry Goddard bringing Binet's test to America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Unlike Binet, who believed intelligence could be improved through education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, American researchers like Spearman often viewed g as unchangeable and inherited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This led to IQ tests being central to the American eugenics movement, resulting in the forced sterilization of over 60,000 people deemed "unfit" based on IQ scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. This awful history contributes to why many disregard IQ tests today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

### Beyond Fixed Intelligence: Influences on IQ Scores
On the science of intelligence, early researchers got some things wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. IQ is not completely fixed; education can improve it, impacting [[impacts_of_education_and_culture_on_iq | impacts of education and culture on IQ]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

Modern science also distinguishes between:
*   **Fluid intelligence**: The ability to learn, process new information, and solve novel problems, which peaks in early adulthood and then declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.
*   **Crystallized intelligence**: Accumulated knowledge over a lifetime, which remains more stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

### The Flynn Effect and Cultural Bias
The **Flynn Effect** describes the observation that average IQ scores have been increasing steadily over the past century, by about two to three points per decade, totaling around a 30-point increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Since population genetics haven't changed dramatically, this suggests other factors are at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. Proposed causes include:
*   Improved childhood nutrition and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
*   Better education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.
*   A societal shift from manual labor to more abstract thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

This phenomenon highlights that IQ tests do not objectively measure a static intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. Cultural changes affect average scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. While some tests claim to be "culture fair," it is impossible to construct such a test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. Tests often assess visual relations, geometric shapes, and patterns, ignoring that cultures differ in their linguistic concepts for shapes or spatial relations, or even how they perceive printed materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. They also don't assess forms of intelligence vital for other cultures, like ethnobotanical knowledge or survival skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

### Motivation and Test-Taking Factors
Beyond cognitive abilities, IQ scores are also influenced by:
*   **Motivation**: Incentives, such as monetary rewards, can significantly increase IQ scores, sometimes by up to 20 points, especially for those with below-average IQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:26:12]</a>.
*   **Training and Coaching**: Familiarization with IQ-style questions and practice can boost scores by up to eight points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
*   **Test-Taking Strategy**: Skills like knowing when to skip questions, eliminating wrong answers, and guessing play a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.
*   **Anxiety**: A small amount of anxiety can be beneficial, but excessive anxiety negatively impacts performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. These factors contribute to [[challenges_in_standardized_testing | challenges in standardized testing]].

## Conclusion

IQ tests, while purporting to measure an objective intelligence, are influenced by genetics, environment, cultural factors, motivation, and test-taking skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. While they offer some predictive power for academic and occupational success, income, and longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, their history of misuse and inherent cultural biases mean they do not provide a complete picture of an individual's intellectual capabilities or worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

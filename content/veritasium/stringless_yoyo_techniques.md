Master yo-yo performer Ben Conde demonstrates advanced yo-yo techniques, including seemingly "stringless" tricks where the yo-yo is not continuously attached to the string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. His skills are showcased on his [[ben_condes_yoyo_channel | YouTube channel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## How the Yo-Yo Works

When a yo-yo is released, it unspools as it falls, converting its gravitational potential energy into kinetic and rotational energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Yo-yos can spin very rapidly, reaching speeds of approximately 6,000 revolutions per minute, which is comparable to the speed of most car engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This high rate of spin provides [[gyroscopic_stability_in_yoyos | gyroscopic stability]], ensuring the yo-yo's axis of rotation remains consistent despite minor disturbances like a breeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Due to its significant [[friction_and_angular_momentum_in_yoyos | angular momentum]], the yo-yo continues to spin in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## The "Bind" Trick

To make the yo-yo return to the hand without being directly attached, a technique called "binding" is used. When Ben Conde tugs the string, he pulls it from one side of the yo-yo to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. As the yo-yo continues to spin, this action causes the string to bind to the spool, allowing the yo-yo to roll back up the string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Observing closely, the exact moment the string binds to the spool can be seen, preventing the yo-yo from unraveling further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Yo-yos are designed with [[friction_and_angular_momentum_in_yoyos | friction pads]], often made of silicone, located inside a small gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. When the string enters this gap, it creates friction, enabling the yo-yo to roll up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Even without these friction pads, a significant amount of [[friction_and_angular_momentum_in_yoyos | friction]] is created when the string wraps around the axle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This principle is similar to how ropes coiled around bollards secure large ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The amount of tension a coiled rope or string can hold is described by the [[physics_of_yoyoing | belt friction equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This equation demonstrates that the force the string can exert on the yo-yo increases exponentially with the angle the string makes around the axle, allowing for the yo-yo to be pulled back with just a few turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Releasing and Catching

To release the yo-yo for a stringless trick, Ben throws it outward and upward without pulling back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This action allows the yo-yo to completely unspool while maintaining its high rate of rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

To catch the yo-yo with just a string, Ben must lodge the string into the gap of the yo-yo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Once caught on the friction pads, the yo-yo begins to roll up the string again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Ben Conde's Favorite Yo-Yo Moment

Ben Conde's favorite yo-yo moment was during his freestyle performance in 2011, when the crowd gave him a standing ovation, bringing tears to his eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

The narrator undertook the task of driving [[blackbird_propeller_craft_experiment | Blackbird]], a one-of-a-kind [[blackbird_propeller_craft_experiment | propeller craft]] built to settle a physics debate [00:00:00]. This debate questioned whether a wind-powered vehicle could go directly downwind faster than the wind itself [00:01:04]. The craft's creators claimed it could achieve this counterintuitive feat, which seemed to violate the law of conservation of energy [00:00:03].

## Initial Impressions and Setup Challenges

Upon seeing the vehicle, the narrator expressed concern about its safety, noting that it felt "makeshift" and "a little unbalanced" [00:00:17]. The location chosen for the test was El Mirage, a dry lakebed a couple of hours from Los Angeles [00:00:44]. The team encountered significant delays, waiting for hours in the hot desert for sufficient and consistent wind [00:02:45].

Getting into the Blackbird presented its own challenges. The narrator found the seating position "very reclined" and noted that his feet needed to go "a long way down" [00:03:33]. He also felt he was "right at the limit of size," implying that anyone smaller might struggle [00:03:49]. Driving required controlling steering with the right hand (push to go left, pull to go right) and the pitch of the propeller blades with the left hand [00:03:55]. A moment of tension arose when the experts disagreed on the correct braking procedure, leaving the narrator feeling "terrifying not to have a, a blanket rule" for stopping [00:04:17].

He described the experience as "intense" and "slightly terrifying," likening the feeling of being supported only by a mesh hammock to "being in a rolling coffin" [00:04:31]. Despite it being "shoddily put together," he was "excited to try it" and "excited to survive" [00:04:47].

## Early Attempts and Mechanical Issues

To gauge the wind and the craft's speed relative to it, a telltale string was positioned at the front of Blackbird [00:05:05]. If the vehicle reached wind speed, the telltale would drop straight down, indicating no apparent wind [00:05:18]. If it exceeded wind speed, the telltale would flip around to point straight at the driver, showing an apparent headwind [00:05:45].

During an early run, the narrator observed the telltale dangling, indicating he was near wind speed (five or six miles an hour) [00:06:06]. However, the propeller chain came off, bringing the run to an end [00:10:26]. He noted that he felt the craft picking up speed and saw the prop spinning, reaching eight or nine miles per hour, just before the prop stopped spinning [00:10:33].

A critical aspect of Blackbird's operation is that its propeller functions as a fan, pushing air backward to drive the craft forward, rather than as a windmill turned by the wind [00:11:11]. The wheels are geared to the propeller in such a way that they turn it opposite to the direction the wind is pushing [00:11:25].

## Escalating Risks and The Breakthrough

As the day progressed, the wind increased, leading to concerns about the craft's structural integrity. During a test run, the propeller showed significant unbalance and vibration [00:12:21]. The team became "pretty uncomfortable with what they saw in terms of the shake, the wobble," fearing the vehicle might "break in half" with the propeller coming down on the driver [00:13:55].

Initially, the high wind (around 15 miles per hour) was deemed too risky for the narrator [00:13:06]. Rick, the inventor, took a turn to assess the safety [00:14:13]. After Rick's run, which appeared less shaky, the team decided it was safe for the narrator to try again, despite the wind having become even stronger [00:14:36]. This situation was described as "sketchy for sure" and "frightening" [00:13:30]. The narrator, however, was determined, stating, "I came here for this. I want to do it. Put me in coach" [00:15:17].

In the final run, as the sun was setting, the narrator committed to going "as fast as I can" [00:15:39]. He concentrated on the telltale [00:15:57]. As Blackbird gained speed, the telltale ultimately flipped around to point straight back at him [00:16:32]. This visually confirmed that he was experiencing an apparent headwind, even though the true wind was coming from behind, thus demonstrating he was "going faster than the wind" [00:16:32].

## Reflection and Understanding

After the successful run, the narrator admitted, "God damn that got my heart rate up" [00:17:13]. Reflecting on the [[experimental demonstrations in physics | experimental craft]]'s operation, he acknowledged that he had worked on the video for weeks without fully understanding its mechanism [00:17:27].

His eventual understanding was that the propeller operates as a fan, pushing air backwards, even when the cart is moving at wind speed or faster [00:17:56]. The energy for this thrust comes from slowing down the tailwind behind the propeller [00:19:05]. The propeller takes "some of the energy out of that wind and converted it into the kinetic energy of this cart" [00:19:05].

The Blackbird team ultimately achieved a record of 2.8 times the wind speed [00:19:50]. The narrator concluded that based on "all of the demonstrations and from riding in the vehicle myself, that this is physically possible" [00:19:57]. He anticipated "a lot of pushback in the comments" due to the counterintuitive nature of the phenomenon but urged civility [00:20:10]. The process of [[experimental verification and challenges | experimental verification and challenges]] was also supported by earlier scale model tests on a treadmill [00:09:16], though initial online responses were skeptical [00:08:52].

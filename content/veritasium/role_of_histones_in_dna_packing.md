Within each human cell, there are six feet of DNA, composed of six billion letters of genetic code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This DNA is divided into 46 pieces, each 3 to 4 cm long, known as [[structure_of_dna_and_chromosomes | chromosomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While chromosomes are often depicted in their condensed, X-like form, they only adopt this appearance when a cell is preparing to divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Typically, DNA exists as a wiggly thread within the cell's nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Given that DNA is approximately 2 nanometers wide but a chromosome can be several centimeters long, entanglement would be a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## DNA Packing with Histones

To prevent tangling and efficiently organize the vast amount of DNA, it is meticulously wrapped around specialized proteins called histones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These histones possess "wiggly tails" which play a crucial role in regulating gene expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Role in Gene Regulation

Histones are integral to [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | gene expression]] by controlling the accessibility of DNA to the cellular machinery responsible for reading and transcribing genetic code.

### DNA Inactivation (Silencing)

When DNA needs to be silenced, such as during [[x_chromosome_inactivation_in_females | X chromosome inactivation]] in females, several mechanisms involving histones are employed:
*   The DNA is packed more closely together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Modifications are made to the "dangly" histone tails, signaling this inactivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   New structural proteins are added to bind everything closer together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   Methyl groups, tiny molecular markers, are added to the DNA, signaling to the cell that this DNA should not be read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

This combined action makes the DNA very difficult for molecular machinery to access and harness its code, effectively switching off or silencing the DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### DNA Activation

In contrast, for active DNA, the structure is more spread out, allowing better access to the genes on the chromosome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Mechanisms for activation include:
*   Histones can be slid along the DNA or even entirely removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   The histone tails undergo different modifications that signal the DNA is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

These processes make it possible for RNA polymerase to access and transcribe the DNA into messenger RNA, which is then used by the cell to produce proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Histones and their modifications are a key part of [[epigenetics_and_gene_expression | epigenetics]], which influences whether genes are turned on or off across all chromosomes, not just single ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. For example, epigenetics ensures that a pancreatic cell can produce insulin by switching on the relevant gene there, while it remains switched off everywhere else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

Mersenne primes are a special class of prime numbers that play a crucial role in the discovery and understanding of [[history_of_perfect_numbers | perfect numbers]]. They are defined as prime numbers of the form 2<sup>P</sup> - 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

## Connection to Perfect Numbers

The significance of Mersenne primes stems from their direct relationship with [[history_of_perfect_numbers | even perfect numbers]]. Ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, around 300 BC, discovered a pattern to generate perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. His formula states that if 2<sup>P</sup> - 1 is a prime number, then 2<sup>(P-1)</sup> * (2<sup>P</sup> - 1) is a perfect number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. Since 2<sup>(P-1)</sup> is always an even number, this formula only generates [[methods_and_challenges_in_discovering_new_perfect_numbers | even perfect numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

For centuries, this was the only known method to generate perfect numbers. It wasn't until Leonhard Euler, nearly 1600 years later, proved that *every* [[methods_and_challenges_in_discovering_new_perfect_numbers | even perfect number]] has Euclid's form, solidifying the critical link between Mersenne primes and [[history_of_perfect_numbers | perfect numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:01]</a>. This proof is known as the Euclid-Euler theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>.

## Historical Discoveries

### Marin Mersenne's Contributions
French polymath Marin Mersenne extensively studied numbers of the form 2<sup>P</sup> - 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. In 1644, he published a book including a list of 11 values for P for which he claimed 2<sup>P</sup> - 1 would be prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. Numbers of this form that are prime are now known as Mersenne primes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. The first seven exponents on his list did indeed result in primes, corresponding to the first seven [[history_of_perfect_numbers | perfect numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. Mersenne acknowledged the difficulty in checking large numbers, stating that "To tell if a given number of 15 to 20 digits is prime or not all time would not suffice for the test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. He discussed the problem with other notable mathematicians like Pierre de Fermat and Rene Descartes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

### Leonhard Euler's Breakthrough
Leonhard Euler, inspired by the work of Fermat, dedicated 40 years to number theory, including the problem of [[history_of_perfect_numbers | perfect numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. In 1732, he discovered the eighth [[history_of_perfect_numbers | perfect number]] by verifying that 2<sup>31</sup> - 1 is prime, as Mersenne had predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

### Later Discoveries and Challenges
For 150 years after Euler, very little progress was made, and no new perfect numbers were discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. English mathematician Peter Barlow even suggested that Euler's eighth perfect number might be the last ever discovered due to their lack of practical utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>.

However, mathematicians continued the pursuit. A number on Mersenne's list, 2<sup>67</sup> - 1, was proven not to be prime by Edouard Lucas in 1876 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. Its factors were famously demonstrated by Frank Nelson Cole in 1903, a task he admitted took him three years of Sunday work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

## Modern Discovery Methods

From 500 BC until 1952, only 12 Mersenne primes (and thus 12 [[history_of_perfect_numbers | perfect numbers]]) were discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>. The primary obstacle was the difficulty in checking whether large Mersenne numbers were prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>.

### Computer-Aided Search
The advent of computers revolutionized the search for Mersenne primes. In 1952, American mathematician Raphael Robinson wrote a computer program to perform this task, running it on the SWAC, then the fastest computer available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>. Within 10 months, he discovered the next five Mersenne primes, leading to the corresponding perfect numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. Over the next 50 years, new Mersenne primes were found rapidly, all with the aid of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.

The size of these primes grew astronomically; by 1994, the largest known Mersenne prime was 2<sup>859,433</sup> - 1, a number 258,716 digits long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.

### Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)
To overcome the increasing difficulty of finding these massive primes, computer scientist George Woltman launched the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. GIMPS distributes the computational work across many volunteers' computers, allowing anyone to contribute their processing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. The project has been highly successful, discovering 17 new Mersenne primes, 15 of which were the largest known primes at the time of their discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.

In 2017, Church Deacon John Pace discovered the 50th Mersenne Prime using GIMPS: 2<sup>77,232,917</sup> - 1, which is over 23 million digits long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>. This achievement was even celebrated with a book containing all its digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>. A year later, the 51st Mersenne Prime, 2<sup>82,589,933</sup> - 1, was discovered, having over 24 million digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. As of today, this is still the largest known prime number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.

## Current Status and Conjectures

As of current knowledge, only 51 Mersenne primes have been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>. The Lenstra and Pomerance Wagstaff conjecture predicts how many Mersenne primes should appear based on the size of P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>. This conjecture performs remarkably well and, more importantly, predicts that there are [[methods_and_challenges_in_discovering_new_perfect_numbers | infinitely many Mersenne primes]], and thus [[methods_and_challenges_in_discovering_new_perfect_numbers | infinitely many even perfect numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>. The reason for their rarity in discovery is their immense size and the computational resources required to find them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:00">[22:08:00]</a>.

However, a conjecture is not a proof. The question of whether there are infinitely many Mersenne primes remains an open problem in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>.

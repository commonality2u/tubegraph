Almost eight years ago, a video was made demonstrating that cutting a grape nearly in half and placing it in a microwave could produce [[microwaving_grapes_to_create_plasma | plasma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, the initial explanation for this phenomenon was lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It wasn't until a recent [[scientific_study_on_microwaving_grapes | scientific study]], published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* by three scientists, that a comprehensive explanation emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This study utilized high-speed and thermal cameras, alongside [[electromagnetic_waves_and_the_role_of_radio_waves_in_imaging | electromagnetic modeling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Interestingly, the scientists discovered that the effect isn't exclusive to grapes; it can also be replicated with hydrogel water beads, which are tiny polymer beads that significantly increase in volume when soaked in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Microwave Wavelength and Grape Size

To understand how microwaving a grape generates [[microwaving_grapes_to_create_plasma | plasma]], it's crucial to consider the properties of household microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   A typical household microwave operates at a frequency of approximately 2.45 gigahertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   This frequency corresponds to an [[wave_physics_and_properties | electromagnetic radiation]] [[wave_physics_and_properties | wavelength]] of about 12 centimeters in air inside the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

While it's generally understood that interesting [[electromagnetic_waves_and_the_role_of_radio_waves_in_imaging | electromagnetic]] phenomena occur when an object is roughly the same [[wave_physics_and_properties | size]] as the [[wave_physics_and_properties | wavelength]], a grape is certainly not 12 centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:02:03]</a>. The key lies in the [[wave_physics_and_properties | wavelength]] *inside* the grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## The Index of Refraction's Critical Role

The **index of refraction** of a grape material significantly alters the [[wave_physics_and_properties | wavelength]] of microwaves passing through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>:
*   While the index of refraction for grapes at visible wavelengths is around 1.33, in the microwave regime, it's almost 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   A higher index of refraction means microwaves travel significantly slower through the grape than through air, roughly ten times slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Consequently, the [[wave_physics_and_properties | wavelength]] inside the grape becomes a tenth of its size in air, reducing from 12 centimeters to approximately 1.2 centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This 1.2 cm is approximately the [[explanation_of_electromagnetic_fields_and_grape_size | size]] of a grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Microwave Trapping and Resonant Modes

When a single, uncut grape is placed in a microwave, the microwaves become trapped inside it due to its high refractive index and appropriate [[explanation_of_electromagnetic_fields_and_grape_size | size]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   This trapping occurs because the grape's diameter is roughly the same as the microwave [[wave_physics_and_properties | wavelength]] *within* the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The microwaves essentially bounce off the grape's borders and cannot escape, similar to total internal reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   Once trapped, the microwaves form [[wave_physics_and_properties | resonant modes]], or [[wave_physics_and_properties | standing waves]], where the maximum [[electromagnetic_waves_and_the_role_of_radio_waves_in_imaging | electromagnetic field]] strength is concentrated in the center of the grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This leads to the grape heating from the inside out, rather than the outside in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Interaction of Multiple Grapes and Plasma Formation

The phenomenon intensifies when two grapes are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>:
*   Each grape individually traps microwaves, with the highest amplitude in its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   When two grapes are moved close enough to each other (closer than a [[wave_physics_and_links | wavelength]]), their [[electromagnetic_waves_and_the_role_of_radio_waves_in_imaging | electromagnetic fields]] begin to interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   If the grapes touch, the greatest [[electromagnetic_waves_and_the_role_of_radio_waves_in_imaging | electromagnetic field]] strength is concentrated at their contact point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This is where the grapes become hottest and where the [[microwaving_grapes_to_create_plasma | plasma]] is formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   The strong [[electromagnetic_waves_and_the_role_of_radio_waves_in_imaging | electric fields]] at this intersection are powerful enough to ionize the air, creating sparks and leading to [[microwaving_grapes_to_create_plasma | plasma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. These sparks create ions that can absorb more energy from the microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

The plasma often pulses at 120 Hertz, which is twice the 60 Hertz frequency of mains power, reflecting the twice-per-cycle pulsing amplitude of the microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Analysis of the [[microwaving_grapes_to_create_plasma | plasma]] spectrum reveals strong potassium and sodium emission lines, indicating these ions are common in grapes and are sprayed into the air when [[microwaving_grapes_to_create_plasma | plasma]] forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Grape Size and Microwave Absorption

The [[explanation_of_electromagnetic_fields_and_grape_size | size]] of the grapes is important, which explains why this effect isn't common with other squishy fruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. However, the grapes don't need to be an *exact* [[explanation_of_electromagnetic_fields_and_grape_size | size]] because water absorbs microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

*   If the material inside the grape did not absorb microwaves, extreme amplification of [[electromagnetic_waves_and_the_role_of_radio_waves_in_imaging | electromagnetic fields]] would only occur at very specific [[explanation_of_electromagnetic_fields_and_grape_size | sizes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   However, since grapes are made of an absorbent material like water, the peaks of amplification are broadened, allowing for less extreme amplification but over a wider range of [[explanation_of_electromagnetic_fields_and_grape_size | sizes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This explains why many grapes, even with varied [[explanation_of_electromagnetic_fields_and_grape_size | sizes]], can produce the effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Applications of the Research

Beyond being a "fun trick," this research has significant potential applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The phenomenon demonstrates that two spheres of the correct [[explanation_of_electromagnetic_fields_and_grape_size | size]] and refractive index can focus [[electromagnetic_waves_and_the_role_of_radio_waves_in_imaging | electromagnetic energy]] into a tiny spot between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   In the case of grapes, this focuses radiation with a 12-centimeter [[wave_physics_and_properties | wavelength]] down to approximately a millimeter spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   If similar focusing could be achieved with light, it would offer a substantial improvement over current lithography techniques used in microchip fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This could enable the creation of much smaller features, potentially extending Moore's Law, which governs the increasing density of transistors on integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

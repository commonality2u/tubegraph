The Hilbert Hotel is a thought experiment used to explore [[mathematical_paradoxes_of_infinity | paradoxes]] related to infinity, particularly the [[concept_of_countably_vs_uncountably_infinite | concept of countably vs. uncountably infinite]] sets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> It features an infinite number of rooms, numbered one, two, three, and so on, forever. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> While it might seem capable of accommodating anyone, there is a limit to even its infinite capacity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

## Accommodating New Guests

Initially, imagine all rooms are full, with one person in each. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

### A Single New Guest

When a single new guest arrives, despite all rooms being occupied, the manager can accommodate them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> All existing guests are instructed to move down one room (e.g., room 1 moves to room 2, room 2 to room 3). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> This frees up room one for the new guest. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>

### A Bus with a Finite Number of Guests

If a bus carrying a finite number of people (e.g., one hundred) arrives, the solution is similar. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> All current guests move down by the number of new arrivals (e.g., one hundred rooms). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> The new guests then occupy the newly vacated rooms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>

### An Infinite Bus with Infinite Guests

The challenge escalates when an infinitely long bus carrying an infinite number of people arrives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> The solution involves a different strategy:
1.  **Existing guests relocate:** Each current guest moves to the room with double their current room number (e.g., room 1 to 2, room 2 to 4, room 3 to 6). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
2.  **Odd rooms vacated:** This action makes all odd-numbered rooms available. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
3.  **Infinite odd rooms:** Since there are an infinite number of odd numbers, each person from the infinite bus can be assigned a unique odd-numbered room. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

### An Infinite Number of Infinite Buses

Even more challenging, what if an infinite number of infinite buses arrive? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
The solution uses an "infinite spreadsheet": <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
1.  **Grid organization:** Rows represent the existing hotel guests and each incoming bus (Bus 1, Bus 2, etc.). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> Columns represent the position of each person (Hotel Room 1, Bus 1 Seat 1, etc.). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
2.  **Unique identification:** Each person receives a unique identifier based on their vehicle and position. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>
3.  **Diagonal assignment:** By drawing a zigzag line across the spreadsheet, starting from the top-left corner and touching each unique ID exactly once, this infinite-by-infinite grid can be "straightened out" into a single infinite line. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
4.  **Room assignment:** Each person on this single infinite line can then be assigned a unique room in the hotel. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>

## The Limit: Uncountably Infinite Guests

A true limit to the Hilbert Hotel's capacity is reached when an infinite party bus arrives, whose passengers are identified by infinitely long names consisting only of the letters A and B. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> Crucially, every possible infinite sequence of these two letters exists as a name on this bus. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>

The manager explains that these guests cannot be accommodated, demonstrating this using a method similar to Cantor's Diagonalization Argument:
1.  **Attempted assignment:** The manager attempts to assign rooms to people on the bus by listing them (e.g., Room 1 to ABBA, Room 2 to ABAB...). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
2.  **Constructing a missing name:** Even with a complete infinite list, it is possible to construct a name that is not on the list. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> This is done by taking the first letter of the first name and flipping it (A to B, B to A), then taking the second letter of the second name and flipping it, and so on, down the diagonal of the list. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
3.  **Guaranteed uniqueness:** The newly constructed name is guaranteed to be different from every name on the list by at least one character (the character on the diagonal corresponding to its position in the list). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>

## The [[implications_of_different_sized_infinities | Implications of Different Sized Infinities]]

The number of rooms in the Hilbert Hotel is infinite, specifically **countably infinite**. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a> This means there are as many rooms as there are positive integers (1, 2, 3...). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> By contrast, the number of people on the last bus (infinite sequences of A's and B's) is **uncountably infinite**. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> If one attempts to match each of these people with an integer, there will always be people left over. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>

This thought experiment demonstrates that [[the_different_sizes_of_infinity | some infinities are bigger than others]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> The discovery of these different [[the_different_sizes_of_infinity | sized infinities]] led to further profound inquiries, including developments that contributed to the invention of modern computing devices. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>

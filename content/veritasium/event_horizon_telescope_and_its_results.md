On April 10, 2019, the [[First image of a black hole by Event Horizon Telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]] was scheduled to release its results, anticipated to be the first-ever image of a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The speaker, who had not yet seen the actual results at the time of recording, anticipated the image would resemble a "fuzzy coffee mug stain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Significance of the Image

Despite a potentially simple appearance, the image's significance is profound. It is expected to reveal whether the general theory of relativity accurately predicts phenomena in the "strong gravity regime" â€” specifically, what occurs around a [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Understanding a Black Hole Image

To comprehend what the [[First image of a black hole by Event Horizon Telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]] aims to show, it's essential to understand the components and effects around a [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]]:

### [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | Event Horizon]] and Schwarzschild Radius
The [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | event horizon]] is a spherical boundary around a [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] from which nothing, not even light, can escape detection by an outside observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Once inside, all paths lead to the singularity at the center, with no return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The radius of the [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | event horizon]] is known as the [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | Schwarzschild radius]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Accretion Disk and Visibility
A lone [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] would be invisible as it absorbs all [[use of electromagnetic waves to view black holes | electromagnetic radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. However, the specific [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] targeted by the [[First image of a black hole by Event Horizon Telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]] is Sagittarius A*, located at the center of our Milky Way galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. It is surrounded by an accretion disk of incredibly hot (millions of degrees) dust and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This matter swirls chaotically and moves at a significant fraction of the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This accretion disk is the source of light that allows us to "see" the [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]]'s vicinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Orbits Around a Black Hole
*   **Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO):** The accretion disk does not extend all the way to the [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | event horizon]] because there is an innermost stable circular orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. For a non-spinning [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]], this orbit is located at three [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | Schwarzschild radii]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Matter that crosses inside this orbit quickly spirals into the [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Photon Sphere:** Light, having no mass, can orbit even closer, at 1.5 [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | Schwarzschild radii]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This forms a sphere of photon orbits, where if one could stand, they might see the back of their own head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. However, the photon sphere is an unstable orbit; photons eventually either spiral into the singularity or escape to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### The Black Hole "Shadow"
The "shadow" observed in a [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] image is not simply the [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | event horizon]], the photon sphere, or the ISCO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] significantly warps spacetime, causing light rays to bend and curve rather than travel in straight lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

*   Light rays entering near or even just above the [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | event horizon]], including those at the distance of the photon sphere, will eventually be warped into the [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   For an observer to receive a parallel light ray that *doesn't* fall into the [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]], the ray must originate at least 2.6 [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | Schwarzschild radii]] away.At this distance, a light ray will just graze the photon sphere before continuing to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   The resulting shadow is therefore approximately 2.6 times bigger than the [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   Within this shadow, the center corresponds to the [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Due to the extreme light bending, we can see the entire back side of the [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | event horizon]] mapped onto a ring within this shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Approaching the edge of the shadow, one can even see infinite images of the [[understanding_event_horizon_and_schwarzschild_radius | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   The first light we detect are those rays that graze the photon sphere before reaching our telescopes, defining the 2.6 times larger shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Viewing Angles and [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_black_holes | Relativistic Beaming]]
The appearance of the [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]]'s shadow can vary based on the observer's angle relative to the accretion disk:
*   **Perpendicular View:** This yields the "fuzzy coffee mug stain" appearance described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Edge-on View:** Due to spacetime warping, light from the back of the accretion disk can bend over the top, and light from the bottom can bend underneath, making the entire accretion disk visible, even if viewed edge-on. This results in an image similar to the [[First image of a black hole by Event Horizon Telescope | black hole]] depicted in the movie *Interstellar* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Complex Light Paths:** Light can even travel from one side of the accretion disk, loop around the back of the [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]], graze the photon sphere, and emerge on the opposite side, creating thin rings of light around the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

A crucial effect is [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_black_holes | relativistic beaming]] (or Doppler beaming): matter in the accretion disk moves very fast, close to the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. If matter is moving towards the observer, it appears significantly brighter than if it's moving away. This will cause one side of the accretion disk to appear much brighter, creating a bright spot in the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Future Potential
Future observations over time could be very exciting, as tracking "blobs" of matter moving around the [[black holes and event horizons | black hole]] and seeing them appear in different parts of the warped image would be a significant development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

For thousands of years, humans have utilized various computing devices, with [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computers]] often being the most powerful available up until the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. However, with the advent of solid-state transistors, [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | digital computers]] exploded onto the scene, leading to the [[technological_obsolescence_and_innovation | obsolescence]] of most analog systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Today, many people have never even heard of analog computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

However, this trend may be changing, and [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computers]] are experiencing a potential resurgence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

## What is an Analog Computer?

An [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computer]] works by analogy, where the motions or properties of physical components are analogous to the quantities being computed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. For example, in a simple analog adder, the rotation of wheels can represent numbers, and the sum is shown by the rotation of a third wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Key characteristics of [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computers]] include:
*   **Continuous Range** They have a continuous range of inputs and outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Physical Representation** Quantities of interest are represented by something physical, like the amount a wheel has turned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Direct Analogy** If the answer to a problem is "two," there is a physical component in the analog computer that is "twice as much" as a "one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

This contrasts with [[differences_between_analog_and_digital_computers | digital computers]], which operate only with discrete values (like zeros and ones) and work on abstract symbols rather than physical analogies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Historical Context: The Antikythera Mechanism

One of the earliest known examples of an [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computer]] is the [[the_antikythera_mechanism_as_an_early_analog_computer | Antikythera Mechanism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Discovered in a 1901 shipwreck off the island of Antikythera, this ancient Greek artifact, constructed around 100 or 200 BC, contains 37 interlocking bronze gears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It was capable of modeling the motions of the sun and moon and predicting eclipses decades in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. A device of similar sophistication would not be seen again for over a thousand years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Reasons for the Resurgence of Analog Computing

The current interest in [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computers]] is driven by two main factors:

1.  **Limits of Moore's Law** Moore's Law, which predicted the doubling of transistors on a chip every two years, is approaching its physical limits as transistors near the size of individual atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This means the continuous miniaturization that has driven digital computing's growth is slowing down.
2.  **Demands of Machine Learning** Advances in machine learning and [[applications_of_analog_computers_in_ai | artificial intelligence]] are creating computational demands that are increasingly straining the capabilities of [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | digital computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

A "new generation of [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computers]]" is being explored as a potential solution to these [[challenges_and_potential_of_analog_computing_in_modern_technology | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Startups are actively working on developing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Analog Computing

### Historical Advantages

Historically, [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computers]] were crucial for complex tasks before the widespread adoption of digital technology.
*   **Solving Complex Equations** Lord Kelvin's mechanical [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computers]], like the tide predicting machine and the harmonic analyzer, revolutionized the ability to predict tides by summing complex sinusoidal components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. His machines were used well into the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Real-time Applications** During [[analog_computers_in_military_applications_during_world_war_ii | World War II]], [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computers]] played a critical role. For example, the M9 Gun Director, which used analog electrical operational amplifiers, could rapidly calculate the correct trajectory and fuse settings for anti-aircraft guns based on radar and optical data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Its introduction dramatically reduced the number of rounds needed to take down an airplane from 17,000 in World War I to 90 by 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

### Disadvantages and Decline

Despite their historical importance, [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computers]] face inherent limitations that contributed to their decline:
*   **Inaccuracy** Because the physical device models the real world, any inaccuracy in components translates directly into computational inaccuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Minor imperfections, like "slop" in connections, mean that running the same calculation twice might not yield the exact same answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability to Noise** Small errors in [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computers]] can grow and "swamp the signal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   **Lack of Versatility** Each [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | analog computer]] is typically designed for only one type of problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

## The Rise of Digital and Its Strengths

The digital revolution was significantly propelled by Claude Shannon's 1936 master's thesis, which demonstrated that any numerical operation could be performed using the basic building blocks of Boolean algebra (true/false, 0/1, and, or, not) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This made [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | digital computers]] incredibly versatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

Advantages of [[analog_computers_history_and_resurgence | digital computers]]:
*   **Exact Answers** Since they operate on symbols (zeros and ones), digital devices provide exact answers and repeatable results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   **Robustness to Noise** It takes a significant error to mistake a one for a zero, making them resilient to noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   **Miniaturization and Universality** With only a few components needed for virtually any computation, these components have been highly miniaturized and optimized, making digital computers ideal universal computing machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

These advantages led to digital technology pervading almost every aspect of modern life, from phones to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

## The Potential Future

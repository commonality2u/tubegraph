The debate surrounding the "Blackbird" vehicle, designed to travel downwind faster than the wind itself, highlights common misconceptions in physics and the importance of rigorous theoretical analysis and experimental evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. A $10,000 bet was initiated by a physics professor at UCLA, Alex Kusenko, who believed the vehicle's claims and explanations were incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

## Professor Kusenko's Initial Concerns

Professor Kusenko's skepticism was rooted in several theoretical and practical [[misconceptions_about_electricity_in_circuits | misconceptions]] he identified in the initial explanation of Blackbird's operation:

### Gusty Wind and Inertia
He argued that the car's apparent speed advantage might be due to a gust of wind pushing it to high speed, after which the wind speed drops, making the car momentarily appear to go faster than the wind by inertia, while in fact it is decelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. He posited that whenever the velocity is faster than the wind, the acceleration would be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

### Wind Gradient
Another point raised was the wind gradient, where wind travels slower close to the ground and faster higher up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. The wind speed was measured at about a meter or a meter and a half, while the propeller extends to about three meters above the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This suggested the car could be moving slower than the wind at the propeller, yet appear faster at the lower tell-tale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. He considered this a small effect but potentially significant in combination with wind gusts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### Treadmill Test Anomalies
Professor Kusenko also questioned the treadmill tests, which simulate a steady tailwind in still air by moving the ground backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. He suggested that fluctuations in treadmill speed or unconscious human steering could bias the results towards the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

### The "Divide by Zero" Problem in Equations
A major theoretical concern was an equation for net force, such as one by MIT Aero Professor Mark Drela, which included the difference between the car's speed and the wind's speed in the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. This implied an infinite force when the car travels exactly at wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. Professor Kusenko performed his own analysis, which found no such divide-by-zero problems, but concluded there was no way for the car to accelerate at or above wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. His analysis indicated that the acceleration of the craft would be negative in such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## Addressing the Misconceptions with Deeper Explanation

To counter these points and demonstrate the vehicle's capability, a more detailed explanation of Blackbird's operation and additional evidence was provided:

### Evidence Against Gusts and Gradients
*   **Tell-tales at multiple heights**: Experiments mounted tell-tales on fishing poles to the sides and even above the propeller. While the lowest tell-tale flipped back first, all tell-tales eventually flipped backwards, indicating every part of the vehicle was moving faster than the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
*   **Continued acceleration**: Analysis of video footage using back wheel rotation showed the car continued to accelerate even after the tell-tale flipped backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
*   **Consistent performance**: The tell-tale consistently pointed straight back for over 30 seconds until the brakes were applied, suggesting sustained speed, not momentary gusts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.
*   **Record speed data**: When Blackbird achieved its record speed of 27.7 miles per hour in a 10 mph tailwind, it was still accelerating, confirmed by multiple GPS units and wind speed measurements at the propeller's height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.
*   **Physics Olympiad**: In 2013, the U.S. Physics Olympiad Semifinal Exam included questions about Blackbird, with the solution stating that both downwind and upwind modes are possible, and with low energy loss, "any speed is possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

### How Blackbird Works
A key to understanding Blackbird is realizing that the propeller does not work like a windmill, being pushed by the tailwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. Instead, it turns in the opposite direction, acting like a fan that pushes air backwards to generate forward thrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. This fan is powered by the wheels, which are connected to the propeller via a bike chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

The core principle is a power analysis in the frame of reference of the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. The relevant equation is: Power = Force Ã— Velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.
*   **Power Input**: At the wheels, power is input by the ground moving underneath the car. This power is the force of the ground on the wheels multiplied by the car's velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
*   **Power Output**: At the propeller, work is done on the air as it pushes it backward. The power output equals the force of the prop on the air multiplied by the speed of the car minus the speed of the wind (relative speed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.
Assuming no losses, the power in at the wheels equals the power out at the propeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. Because the wheels are going much faster over the ground than the propeller is moving through the air (due to the tailwind), the thrust force from the propeller can be larger than the backwards force on the wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

### The Lever/Pulley Analogy and the "Divide by Zero" Resolution
The car functions much like a mechanical lever or pulley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. A small force applied to the wheels over a larger distance allows the propeller to apply a larger force over a smaller distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.

Regarding the "divide by zero" problem when the car's speed equals wind speed:
1.  **Theoretical Expectation**: Theoretically, with any lever, if one arm's displacement is zero, an infinite weight can be lifted with any amount of force on the other side, but its displacement will also be zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.
2.  **Propeller Efficiency**: In practice, a propeller efficiency term resolves this, as it is ill-defined when the propeller is not moving through the air (i.e., relative speed is zero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. A "better formula" exists for prop proficiency that is well-defined in the zero-speed limit, eliminating the divide-by-zero issue, though it makes the algebra more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

### Simple Demonstration
The core concept does not require complex aerodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. A simple cart with a large wheel rolling on two smaller spools can demonstrate that when in contact with two media moving relative to each other, the cart can move faster than their relative velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. When the board moves to the right, the cart moves faster than the board, with the big wheel rotating in the opposite direction of the board's push, analogous to Blackbird's propeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.

This deeper explanation and new evidence led Professor Kusenko to concede the bet, highlighting that disagreements in science are opportunities for learning and deeper understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.

### Historical Context
The concept of a downwind-faster-than-the-wind cart isn't new. Andrew Bauer built the first successful one in 1969 to settle a friendly wager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. The idea was inspired by a student paper from 20 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. Other analyses have been published under names like the "push-me pull-you boat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. Rick Cavallaro, the builder of Blackbird, was unaware of this history until after constructing his vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

Standardized tests, such as the SAT, have historically played a significant role in college admissions in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. For decades, the SAT was the primary exam every student had to take to apply to colleges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Historical Significance and Reputation
The SAT developed a reputation for determining students' entire futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. A newspaper from the era articulated this sentiment, stating that a poor performance on the SAT could signify the end of one's "life as a productive citizen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The College Board is the company that administers the SAT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Impact of Errors
Mistakes on the SAT are not supposed to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. However, a notable error occurred in 1982 with [[the_sat_question_everybody_got_wrong|SAT question 17]], which no student answered correctly because the test writers themselves had miscalculated the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34">[01:34]</a>. This question was subsequently nullified for all test-takers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

The rescoring of the 1982 SAT, with question 17 removed, could adjust students' final scores by up to 10 points out of 800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. While this might seem minimal, 10 points can have a considerable [[impact_of_question_errors_on_standardized_tests|impact]] on a person's educational opportunities, especially since many universities and scholarships employ strict minimum test score cutoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. For instance, it might not prevent someone from attending law school but could influence which one they are accepted into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

The rescoring process itself was costly, exceeding $100,000, with these expenses ultimately borne by test-takers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Errors like [[the_sat_question_everybody_got_wrong|question 17]] were not isolated incidents on the SAT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## Declining Relevance
More recently, the role of the SAT has been diminishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly 80% of undergraduate colleges in the US no longer mandate standardized testing for admissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

Researchers investigate how spiders respond to visual stimuli, specifically if they can differentiate colors independent of brightness.

## Experimental Setup

The core theory involves presenting a spider with a moving shape on a screen that is distinct from its background in color, but not in brightness [00:00:05]. The goal is to observe if the spider attempts to follow the moving shape [00:00:07].

### Controlling Spider Movement

A challenge in these [[jumping_spider_vision_experiments | experiments]] is that allowing the [[jumping_spider_vision_experiments | jumping spider]] to freely turn and respond alters its visual field [00:00:11]. To maintain control over what the spiders see, researchers employ an [[experimental_methods_in_spider_research | experimental method]] where they hold the spiders in place [00:00:21]. This is achieved by attaching tiny magnets to their heads, which then hold them stationary [00:00:25]. This technique is an example of the [[use_of_magnets_for_controlling_spider_movement | use of magnets for controlling spider movement]].

### Monitoring Spider Response

To gauge the spider's intended movement without allowing it to physically turn, researchers give the spiders a ball to stand on [00:00:31]. The spiders grip this ball with their feet [00:00:34]. By monitoring how the ball moves under their feet, researchers can infer the direction the spider intends to go [00:00:36]. This method contributes to the [[behavioral_analysis_of_spiders_with_soccer_balls | behavioral analysis of spiders]].

## Interpreting Results

If a spider turns the ball to the left, it indicates that it is likely trying to look to the right to follow the moving shape [00:00:45]. This observed behavior serves as evidence that the spider is capable of discriminating between the colors of the moving shape and its background [00:00:49].

One single scientist, Thomas Midgley Jr., developed three inventions that inadvertently led to the deaths of millions, including himself, and caused significant global consequences such as decreased average intelligence and increased crime rates, alongside two distinct [[environmental_impact_of_pfas_chemicals | environmental disasters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of a Problem: Engine Knocking

In the early 20th century, advancements in automotive technology brought about more powerful engines. The Cadillac Model 30, released in 1911, was the world's first crankless car, featuring a top speed of 45 mph and 40 horsepower, double that of the Ford Model T <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This success, however, came with a significant drawback: the engine was "deafeningly loud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

The issue, known as engine knocking, occurred because the Model 30's engine compressed the fuel-air mixture more than previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This high compression often caused the fuel to spontaneously combust before the spark plug ignited it, leading to haphazard explosions and turbulent pressure waves inside the cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Knocking not only created excessive noise but also reduced power output, lowered fuel efficiency, and damaged engine components, shortening the engine's lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### The Search for an Anti-Knock Additive

Engine knocking could be mitigated by altering the fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Different fuels withstand varying levels of compression before detonating. The octane rating system was developed to quantify this, with iso-octane rated at 100 (high compression tolerance) and n-heptane at zero (low compression tolerance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Charles Kettering, tasked with solving the knocking problem, hired 27-year-old engineer [[Thomas Midgley Jr and the invention of tetraethyl lead | Thomas Midgley Jr.]] to find an additive that would increase the octane rating of ordinary fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Midgley experimented with various compounds, including melted butter, camphor, ethyl acetate, and aluminum chloride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Ethanol showed promise but required a high concentration (about 10% of the fuel mixture), making it too expensive to be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Tellurium was highly effective as an anti-knock agent but produced a terrible smell that Midgley's wife found so offensive he had to sleep in the basement for seven months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

On December 3, 1921, after five years of research, Midgley discovered what he believed to be the perfect solution: tetraethyl lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This additive effectively stopped knocking, had no offensive smell, was cheap to produce, and was effective even at low concentrations (one part in 1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Midgley enthusiastically projected massive profits, estimating over $200 million (more than $3 billion in today's dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## The Rise of Leaded Gasoline and Suppressed Concerns

Midgley and Kettering patented the process for making tetraethyl lead, naming their new additive "Ethyl" to avoid confusion with ethyl alcohol and to obscure the presence of lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. They then partnered with General Motors, [[DuPont and chemical contamination coverup | DuPont]], and Standard Oil of New Jersey to form the Ethyl Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

The marketing campaign was successful, and by 1923, the top three finishers at the Indianapolis 500 used Ethyl fuel, leading to a surge in demand for leaded gasoline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. To meet this demand, the Ethyl Corporation built a new chemical plant in New Jersey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. However, within two months of operation, dozens of workers became ill with [[health_risks_associated_with_pfas_exposure | lead poisoning]], and five died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

In response to public outcry, Midgley held a press conference where he poured tetraethyl lead onto his hands and inhaled it for a full minute, claiming it could be done daily without harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Despite this public display, Midgley was aware of the dangers; he had declined earlier public talks because he was recovering from lead poisoning himself in Florida in 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Known Dangers of Lead

The dangers of lead had been recognized for centuries. In 1786, Benjamin Franklin noted that lead's known toxicity should have led to its discontinuance long ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Lead is particularly dangerous because it mimics calcium in the body, making it difficult to excrete and allowing it to be stored in bones for years, leading to prolonged poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The brain is especially sensitive to lead, which breaks down myelin sheaths and inhibits neurotransmitter release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Common symptoms include headaches, memory loss, and tingling in the hands and feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Children are highly susceptible, with lead exposure causing permanent learning disorders and behavioral problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

Despite warnings from doctors and public health officials from institutions like MIT, Harvard, Yale, and the U.S. Health Service, who called lead a "creeping and malicious poison" and a "serious menace to public health," their concerns were dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Corporations like Standard Oil, driven by profit, refused to abandon what they saw as a "gift from heaven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

## Clair Patterson's Crusade Against Lead Contamination

By the 1950s, lead released from cars burning leaded gasoline became a widespread environmental contaminant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This contamination interfered with Clair Patterson's PhD project at the University of Chicago, where he was attempting to measure the age of the Earth by analyzing the ratio of uranium to lead in primordial rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. Patterson's lead measurements were consistently and unexpectedly high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

Suspecting environmental contamination, Patterson moved to Caltech in 1952 and built a new lab designed as the world's first "cleanroom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. He removed lead solder from electrical cables, cleaned surfaces daily with ammonia, and ensured constant outward airflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Visitors had to wear plastic bunny suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

Within this pristine environment, Patterson successfully measured the age of the Earth by analyzing meteorites, which are remnants from the solar system's formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. He determined the Earth's age to be 4.55 billion years, a figure within 0.15% of the currently accepted value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

His experience with contamination led Patterson to investigate the "naturalness" of lead in the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. His findings were alarming:
*   **Ocean Concentrations**: Lead concentrations were nearly 10 times higher near the surface of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, indicating recent pollution rather than natural occurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.
*   **Ice Cores**: Analysis of ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica revealed that atmospheric lead levels had been elevated for 4,500 years due to human activities like smelting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. A massive spike occurred in the 20th century, directly attributable to industrialization and tetraethyl lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
*   **Human Bones**: Patterson compared lead levels in the teeth and bones of recently deceased Americans with those of ancient Peruvian and Egyptian mummies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. He found that 20th-century Americans had 1,000 times more lead in their bones than their ancestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

## Profound [[Health risks associated with PFAS exposure | Health Risks]] and Societal Impacts

Patterson's studies and subsequent research revealed the devastating consequences of lead exposure:
*   **Cognitive Decline**: Studies of baby teeth showed that even lead exposure below levels previously considered safe resulted in delayed learning, decreased IQ, and increased behavioral problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. A follow-up study indicated that children with higher lead levels in their baby teeth were significantly more likely to fail out of high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.
*   **IQ Loss**: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines for acceptable lead levels in children's blood dropped from 60 micrograms per deciliter to 3.5, as it became clear there is no safe level of lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Globally, lead is believed to be responsible for nearly two-thirds of all unexplained intellectual disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. A 2022 study estimated that over half of the current U.S. population (170 million people) were exposed to high lead levels in early childhood, resulting in an aggregate loss of over 800 million IQ points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **Increased Crime Rates**: A striking correlation exists between preschool blood lead levels and crime rates, with a 20-year offset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. This pattern has been observed in many countries, including Britain, Canada, and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. A causal link between lead exposure and antisocial or violent behavior has been established; a study of teenagers found that arrested individuals were four times more likely to have elevated lead in their bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. While not solely responsible, lead likely contributed to a portion of the increase in crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   **Mortality**: One of lead's lesser-known effects is the hardening of arteries, leading to increased cardiovascular disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. A 2018 study estimated that lead was responsible for 250,000 heart disease deaths per year in the U.S., potentially accounting for 25 million deaths in the U.S. alone over the past century, and possibly 100 million globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Most of these deaths are attributed to Midgley's decision to add lead to gasoline, a substance he knew was toxic, primarily for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

## Lingering Consequences and Global Phase-Out

Current estimates of deaths caused by lead range from 500,000 to 900,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. A 2020 UNICEF report warned that one in three children globally (over 800 million) have blood lead levels at or above five micrograms per deciliter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. While much of this lead now comes from batteries and industrial processes, some is still a direct consequence of Midgley's invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

Clair Patterson's tireless work revealed that lead in the environment is not natural and that burning lead in combustion engines spread this toxic element across the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. This revelation spurred global action. Japan was the first to ban leaded fuel in 1986, with other countries gradually following suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. Algeria was the last country to do so in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. The United Nations calculates that the elimination of lead from gasoline saves over a million lives per year and $2.45 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

Despite the global phase-out, leaded gasoline is still used in piston-driven airplane engines, which are now the largest source of lead emissions into the air in the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. Benjamin Franklin's observation remains pertinent: "You will observe with concern how long a useful truth may be known and exist before it is generally received and practiced on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.

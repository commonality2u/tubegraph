The Carnot heat engine is one of the most important yet least understood concepts in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is a theoretical construct for an ideal heat engine that operates without friction or losses to the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Its study was foundational for understanding the limits of converting heat into work and for the development of the concept of [[entropy_and_the_second_law_of_thermodynamics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

## Historical Context

In the winter of 1813, at 17 years old, Sadi Carnot, son of one of Napoleon's generals who was also a physicist, requested to join the French military in fighting the invading armies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. After Paris fell to the advancing armies, Carnot was devastated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

Seven years later, while visiting his father, they discussed the significant breakthrough of the time: steam engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Steam engines were crucial for industrial and military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>, but French designs lagged behind those of countries like Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Sadi Carnot took on the challenge of figuring out why, hoping to give France a significant advantage and restore its global standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## The Ideal Heat Engine Cycle

Carnot spent three years studying heat engines, developing a key insight into how an ideal heat engine would work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. His model consisted of:
*   Two very large metal bars: one hot and one cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
*   A chamber filled with air, through which heat could only flow through the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   A piston inside the chamber connected to a [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

The engine operates in a four-step cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>:
1.  **Expansion from Hot Bar**: The hot bar is brought into contact with the chamber. The air inside expands, maintaining its temperature as heat flows in, pushing the piston up and turning the [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
2.  **Adiabatic Expansion**: The hot bar is removed. The air continues to expand, but without heat entering, its temperature decreases until it reaches the temperature of the cold bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
3.  **Compression to Cold Bar**: The cold bar is brought into contact. The [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] pushes the piston down, compressing the air, and heat is transferred into the cold bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
4.  **Adiabatic Compression**: The cold bar is removed. The [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] compresses the gas further, increasing its temperature until it is just below that of the hot bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

This cycle then repeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. Throughout this process, heat from the hot bar is converted into the energy of the [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

### Reversibility

A key feature of Carnot's ideal engine is its complete reversibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. If the engine were run in reverse, the heat absorbed from the cold bar would be transferred back into the hot bar using the energy from the [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. The system could be returned to its original state with no additional energy input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

## Efficiency

Despite being fully reversible and having no friction, the Carnot engine is not 100% efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. The energy gained by the [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]] in each cycle is the heat flowing from the hot bar minus the heat flowing out at the cold bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. Efficiency is calculated by dividing this net energy by the heat input from the hot bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. The hot gas exerts greater pressure, meaning the work done by the gas on the piston is always greater than the work done by the piston on the gas on the cold side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

The efficiency can be increased by increasing the hot side's temperature or decreasing the cold side's temperature (or both) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

### Absolute Zero and the Kelvin Scale

Lord Kelvin recognized that Carnot's ideal heat engine could form the basis for an absolute temperature scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. He posited that if the gas were to expand so much that its particles effectively stopped moving (exerting no pressure), no work would be needed to compress it, and no heat would be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. This concept led to absolute zero, which would yield a 100% efficient engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

Using the Kelvin scale, the efficiency of an ideal heat engine depends fundamentally only on the temperatures of the hot and cold sides, not on the materials or design of the engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. Achieving 100% efficiency would require infinite temperature on the hot side or absolute zero on the cold side, both practically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. This means even an ideal engine cannot be 100% efficient because some heat must be dumped into the cold bar to return the piston to its original position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

## Real vs. Ideal Engines

In Carnot's era, high-pressure steam engines could reach temperatures up to 160 degrees Celsius, giving them a theoretical maximum efficiency of 32% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. However, their actual efficiency was closer to 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. This discrepancy is due to real-world factors:
*   **Friction**: Real engines experience friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.
*   **Heat Dissipation**: Heat is dissipated to the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Constant Temperature Heat Transfer**: Heat is not transferred at constant temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

These factors cause less energy to end up in the [[physics_of_flywheels | flywheel]]; the rest is spread out over the engine's components and radiated into the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. When energy spreads out, it becomes impossible to retrieve it, making the process irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. The total amount of energy remains constant, but its usability decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. Energy is most usable when concentrated and less usable when dispersed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

## Connection to Entropy

Decades after Carnot, German physicist Rudolf Clausius studied Carnot's engine and developed a method to measure how spread out energy becomes, a quantity he named [[entropy_and_the_second_law_of_thermodynamics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. When all energy is concentrated (low [[entropy_and_the_second_law_of_thermodynamics | entropy]]), it is more available to do work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. As energy spreads to the surroundings, [[entropy_and_the_second_law_of_thermodynamics | entropy]] increases, and the same amount of energy becomes less available for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

In 1865, Clausius summarized the first two laws of thermodynamics:
1.  The energy of the universe is constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
2.  The [[entropy_and_the_second_law_of_thermodynamics | entropy]] of the universe tends to a maximum; in other words, energy spreads out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

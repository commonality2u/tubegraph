Airplane doors are typically not locked in the traditional sense, lacking keys, sensors, or passcodes to secure them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Despite instances of people attempting to open emergency exit doors, they are virtually never opened during flight across 40 million annual flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The primary reason for this lies in the high altitude at which planes operate and the [[cabin_pressurization_and_airplane_structural_integrity | cabin pressurization]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Why Planes Fly at High Altitudes

Planes typically fly between 30,000 and 43,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. While some benefits include a smoother ride by flying above the troposphere where most weather occurs, leading to less turbulence and fewer storms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, this is not the main reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The bigger reason is economic efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>:
*   **Reduced Air Density** At 33,000 feet (10 km), air density is only one-third of what it is at sea level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Flying at this altitude means the plane encounters fewer air molecules, allowing it to fly about 73% faster for the same thrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This reduces travel time and fuel consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Engine Efficiency** Jet engines are more efficient in colder air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. At cruising altitude, temperatures are around -50 degrees Celsius, significantly colder than the average +15 degrees Celsius on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Jet Stream Tailwinds** Flying high allows planes to take advantage of jet stream tailwinds, further reducing fuel burn and costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## The Need for [[cabin_pressurization_and_airplane_structural_integrity | Cabin Pressurization]]

Flying at high altitudes presents a significant problem: the air is unbreathable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. At 10 km, the air pressure is only one-quarter of what it is at sea level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. While the air still contains 21% oxygen, the partial pressure of oxygen is too low (around 5.5 kilopascals) for humans to function normally (which requires at least 16 kilopascals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

To counteract this, all airplane cabins that cruise at high altitudes must be [[cabin_pressurization_and_airplane_structural_integrity | pressurized]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. A continuous supply of air is brought into the cabin from the compression stage of the jet engines, maintaining breathable air inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This process slightly reduces engine efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## How Airplane Doors Work

The necessity of [[cabin_pressurization_and_airplane_structural_integrity | cabin pressurization]] led to a radical redesign of aircraft doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Before pressurization, planes flew lower (up to 10,000 feet) where oxygen partial pressure was at the limit of human tolerance, and doors opened outward without much concern for seals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

Once planes were pressurized, all doors were redesigned to be shaped like a plug, wider on the inside than the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This design means that the higher pressure inside the cabin pushes the door into its frame, creating an airtight seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Why Doors Cannot Be Opened in Flight
This [[cabin_pressurization_and_airplane_structural_integrity | pressure difference]] is why airplane doors and emergency exit doors don't need locks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The force exerted by the pressure differential is so great that no individual is strong enough to pull the door inwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Even modern doors that appear to open outward are cleverly designed plugs; they must first pop inwards and rotate to open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This inward movement is impossible at cruising altitude, requiring a force equivalent to lifting 9,000 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Cabin Pressure Level
Airplane cabins are not fully pressurized to sea level pressure (101.3 kilopascals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. At cruising altitude, the cabin pressure typically drops to around 77 kilopascals, resulting in an oxygen partial pressure of 16 kilopascalsâ€”the minimum required for passengers to feel normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This lower pressure is evident when a bag of chips inflates like a balloon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. It also explains why some people experience increased flatulence on planes, as gas in body cavities expands at lower pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## Minimizing Stress and Extending Plane Life

While the International Space Station is pressurized to sea level pressure, planes are [[cabin_pressurization_and_airplane_structural_integrity | pressurized]] to the minimum extent possible to carry human passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This is because planes repeatedly experience a pressure difference with every flight, causing the fuselage to stretch and relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

An incident involving Aloha Airlines Flight 243 in 1988 demonstrated the dangers of metal fatigue caused by repeated [[cabin_pressurization_and_airplane_structural_integrity | pressurization]] cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The plane, which had nearly 90,000 flight cycles (far more than designed), experienced an explosive decompression at 24,000 feet when a crack in the fuselage widened, tearing off a section of the roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Miraculously, pilots landed safely with only one fatality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Thus, planes are minimally pressurized to minimize stresses and extend their operational life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Exceptions to the Rule

Despite the strong pressure differential, an emergency exit door on an Airbus flight was successfully opened by a passenger in May 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This rare event occurred because the plane was on its final approach, very close to the ground, where the pressure differential was minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

Falling objects can pose significant dangers, ranging from minor stings to fatal injuries, depending on their properties and the environment they fall through. The severity of an impact is primarily determined by the object's [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]], which is influenced by its mass and speed. However, [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] plays a crucial role in limiting the speed an object can achieve during free fall, leading to the concept of [[Terminal velocity of different objects | terminal velocity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26">[04:26]</a>.

## The Penny Myth

One of the most persistent myths about falling objects is the idea that a penny dropped from the Empire State Building could kill someone below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This story is widely known, with many people even throwing pennies off the building's ledges to test it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

While a penny weighs around 2.5 grams, about half to a quarter the weight of a bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, ignoring [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] would hypothetically allow it to accelerate to over 300 kilometers per hour from the Empire State Building's 443-meter height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. However, [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] cannot be ignored in real-world scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Penny Experiment

To test this myth, an experiment was conducted where pennies were dropped from a helicopter at a height similar to the Empire State Building's observation deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19">[01:19]</a>. Participants reported that while getting hit by the pennies stung, it was not fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13">[04:13]</a>. The maximum speed a penny reaches is about 80 kilometers per hour, which is not enough to cause serious harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05">[13:05]</a>. Pennies achieve their [[Terminal velocity of different objects | terminal velocity]] after falling only about 15 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15">[10:15]</a>. This means that dropping a penny from 15 meters or 3,000 meters would feel the same, as they would be traveling at the same speed upon impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30">[10:30]</a>.

A curious property of pennies is that they don't have a single [[Terminal velocity of different objects | terminal velocity]] due to their tendency to flutter and tumble as they fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10">[11:10]</a>. They oscillate between two [[Terminal velocity of different objects | terminal velocities]], one on their face and one on their edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19">[11:19]</a>.

## Terminal Velocity

[[Terminal velocity of different objects | Terminal velocity]] is the maximum speed an object will reach in free fall through still air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01">[06:01]</a>. It is achieved when the force of gravity pulling an object down equals the force of [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] pushing it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10">[05:10]</a>.

### Factors Affecting Terminal Velocity:

*   **Weight to Air Resistance Ratio:** This ratio is crucial in determining an object's [[Terminal velocity of different objects | terminal velocity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55">[05:55]</a>.
*   **Cross-sectional Area:** Drag is proportional to an object's cross-sectional area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54">[09:54]</a>.
*   **Overall Shape (Drag Coefficient):** The drag coefficient is a dimensionless number that captures how smoothly air flows around an object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46">[15:46]</a>. A lower drag coefficient means less [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] and thus a higher [[Terminal velocity of different objects | terminal velocity]] for a given weight.

## Other Falling Objects and Their Hazards

### Pens

It has been suggested that ballpoint pens falling from a skyscraper could be lethal due to their more aerodynamic shape compared to pennies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23">[13:23]</a>. Pens weigh about twice as much as a penny and have a smaller cross-sectional area, which increases their weight-to-drag ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44">[13:44]</a>. However, experiments dropping plastic ballpoint pens from a helicopter showed that they did not penetrate a ballistics gel dummy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00">[14:00]</a>. This indicates that these plastic pens still have too much drag relative to their weight to achieve a high enough [[Terminal velocity of different objects | terminal velocity]] to be dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31">[15:31]</a>. Narrow metal pens might still pose a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28">[15:28]</a>.

### Raindrops

Rain falls through the thick air of the troposphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10">[18:10]</a>. Raindrops have a low [[Terminal velocity of different objects | terminal velocity]] of just 25 kilometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42">[08:42]</a>. Raindrops are typically between 0.5 and 4 millimeters in diameter and are more spherical but flatter on the bottom where they encounter air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26">[08:26]</a>. When a raindrop gets too large, it flattens out, caves in, and breaks into smaller droplets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02">[09:02]</a>. Given their low [[Terminal velocity of different objects | terminal velocity]] and tiny mass, raindrops are not damaging, delivering only about 0.002 Joules of [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17">[20:17]</a>.

### Hailstones

Unlike raindrops, hail can be very dangerous. Hailstones can reach [[Terminal velocity of different objects | terminal velocities]] of over 200 kilometers per hour, which is about 10 times that of rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29">[09:29]</a>. This higher speed is primarily because hail can grow much larger than raindrops, with some hailstones measured up to 20 centimeters in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46">[09:46]</a>. Since weight scales with radius cubed while drag scales with radius squared, larger hailstones have a much higher weight-to-drag ratio, leading to a faster [[Terminal velocity of different objects | terminal velocity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57">[09:57]</a>. They also carry more mass, resulting in greater [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] upon impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08">[10:08]</a>. Hail injures around 20 people and has caused four fatalities in the US since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22">[09:22]</a>. The largest measured hailstone delivered over 80 Joules of [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]], enough to fracture a human skull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26">[20:26]</a>.

### Bullets

When a bullet is simply dropped from a skyscraper, it does not fall pointy-side down. Instead, it tumbles and often ends up falling on its side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35">[16:35]</a>. This tumbling behavior significantly increases its [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]], making its [[Terminal velocity of different objects | terminal velocity]] much lower than if it maintained its aerodynamic shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21">[17:21]</a>.

However, if a bullet is fired straight up and then falls back down, it also tumbles and experiences more [[effect_of_air_resistance_on_falling_objects | air resistance]] on the way down than on the way up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21">[17:21]</a>. This means it hits the ground much slower than its launch speed, but the potential danger is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31">[17:31]</a>. The danger significantly increases if the bullet is not fired completely vertically, maintaining horizontal velocity and spin from the gun barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37">[17:37]</a>. In such cases, the bullet continues to move pointy-end forwards, leading to a much higher impact speed upon return to the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55">[17:55]</a>. Celebratory gunfire, where bullets are fired into the air, has caused hundreds of deaths globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06">[18:06]</a>.

### Military Projectiles

The concept of dropping deadly projectiles from aircraft dates back to World War I.

*   **Fléchettes:** These were small metal pieces, resembling nails with feathers, dropped from planes in WWI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21">[18:21]</a>. They were designed to fall straight and could be up to 15 centimeters long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32">[18:32]</a>. Fléchettes were cheap to produce, did not require explosives, and could pierce helmets, causing nasty injuries. Some even passed through both a rider and his horse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49">[18:49]</a>. While the [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | energy]] stored in a falling fléchette might not be enough to crack a skull (below 68 Joules), its ability to apply a large force to a very small area makes it dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40">[20:40]</a>.
*   **Lazy Dogs:** Similar but heftier kinetic projectiles used by the US military in the Korean and Vietnam wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:16">[19:16]</a>. They caused indiscriminate and unpredictable damage but did not leave unexploded ordinances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24">[19:24]</a>.

Militaries continue to use kinetic projectiles today for precision strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31">[19:31]</a>.

### General Civilian Objects

Nearly 700 Americans die each year from being struck by falling objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37">[19:37]</a>. These objects can include:

*   Loose tiles and bricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44">[19:44]</a>
*   Falling construction tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46">[19:46]</a>
*   Falling rocks and tree branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48">[19:48]</a>
*   Icicles: While rare, icicles can be dangerous, leading to street closures in urban areas like New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51">[19:51]</a>.

A man was killed in 2014 when hit by a measuring tape that fell 50 stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31">[20:31]</a>.

## Lethality Threshold

The lower limit of [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | energy]] required to fracture a human skull is around 68 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07">[20:07]</a>. Any object delivering greater [[kinetic_energy_and_its_effects_on_impact | kinetic energy]] than this is very likely to be lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12">[20:12]</a>.

*   **Penny:** ~0.2 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21">[20:21]</a>.
*   **Baseball or largest hailstone:** >80 Joules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26">[20:26]</a>.

Ultimately, objects that weigh only a few grams and are not aerodynamic, like pennies and plastic pens, are unlikely to be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53">[20:53]</a>. However, objects weighing more than a few hundred grams traveling at [[Terminal velocity of different objects | terminal velocity]] are likely to be deadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58">[20:58]</a>.

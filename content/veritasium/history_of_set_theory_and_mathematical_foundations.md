For two millennia, Euclid's elements were considered the fundamental basis of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. However, at the turn of the 19th century, non-Euclidean geometries were discovered by Lobachevsky and Gauss, prompting mathematicians to examine the foundations of their field more closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Concerns arose about the poorly defined concept of a limit at the heart of calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, and the complexity of infinity was revealed to be far greater than previously imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This period of upheaval led to a significant fracturing of mathematics and a major debate among mathematicians at the end of the 1800s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Georg Cantor and the Birth of Set Theory

In 1874, German mathematician Georg Cantor published a paper that introduced set theory, a new branch of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. A set is defined as a well-defined collection of things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Cantor's work focused on sets of numbers, such as natural numbers (positive integers like 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on) and real numbers (which include fractions, irrational numbers like pi, e, and the square root of two, essentially any number representable as an infinite decimal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Cantor questioned whether there were more natural numbers or more real numbers between zero and one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. He addressed this with his [[incompleteness_of_mathematics#Cantor's Diagonalization Proof|diagonalization proof]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. By imagining an infinite list matching natural numbers with real numbers between zero and one, and then constructing a new real number different from every number on the list by at least one digit, Cantor demonstrated that there must be more real numbers than natural numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This proved that not all infinities are the same size, leading to the distinction between countable and uncountable infinities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

Cantor's findings were controversial. The "intuitionists" argued that his work was nonsensical, believing math was a pure creation of the human mind and that his infinities were not real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Henri Poincaré regarded set theory as a "disease," and Leopold Kronecker called Cantor a "scientific charlatan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Hilbert's Formalist Dream

Opposing the intuitionists were the "formalists," who believed that mathematics could be placed on secure logical foundations through Cantor's set theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. David Hilbert, a highly influential German mathematician, was the informal leader of this group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Hilbert was convinced that a more formal and rigorous system of mathematical proof, based on set theory, could resolve all the issues that had emerged in mathematics over the previous century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. He famously declared, "No one shall expel us from the paradise that Cantor has created" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

Hilbert sought to establish the foundations of mathematics by developing a new system for mathematical proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Proof systems start with axioms (basic statements assumed to be true) and use rules of inference to derive new, true statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Hilbert desired a formal system of proof: a symbolic logical language with rigid rules for symbol manipulation, allowing logical and mathematical statements to be translated into this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead developed such a formal system in their three-volume *Principia Mathematica*, published in 1913 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. This vast work, nearly 2,000 pages of dense mathematical notation, aimed for exactness, leaving no room for errors or fuzzy logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

Hilbert posed three fundamental questions about mathematics that he believed had positive answers:
1.  **Completeness:** Is math complete? Can every true statement be proven? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>
2.  **Consistency:** Is mathematics consistent? Is it free of contradictions? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>
3.  **Decidability:** Is math decidable? Is there an algorithm that can always determine whether a statement follows from the axioms? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>

At a major conference in 1930, Hilbert ended a speech with his famous slogan, "We must know, we will know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## Russell's Paradox

In 1901, Bertrand Russell identified a serious problem in Cantor's set theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. If sets could contain anything, including other sets or even themselves, paradoxes arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Russell's paradox centered on the set of all sets that do not contain themselves (let's call it 'R') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. If R does not contain itself, then by its definition, it must contain itself. Conversely, if R does contain itself, then by definition, it must not contain itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This self-referential contradiction was also illustrated by the "barber paradox": a village barber shaves all and only those men who do not shave themselves; but who shaves the barber? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>

While the intuitionists celebrated Russell's paradox as proof of set theory's flaws, mathematicians from Hilbert's school, like Zermelo, addressed the problem by restricting the concept of a set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Collections like "the set of all sets" were no longer considered valid sets, thus eliminating the paradoxes arising from self-reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems

Despite the formalists' attempts to resolve the issues, self-reference resurfaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. In 1930, Kurt Gödel, a 24-year-old logician, presented his findings at a conference, showing that a complete formal system of mathematics was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. The following year, Gödel published his [[incompleteness_of_mathematics|incompleteness theorem]], which drew widespread attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

Gödel's proof involved assigning a unique "Gödel number" to every basic symbol in a mathematical system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. He then assigned Gödel numbers to sequences of symbols, such as equations and proofs, by taking prime numbers raised to the power of the Gödel numbers of the symbols in the sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This allowed mathematical statements and proofs to be represented as numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

Using this system, Gödel constructed a self-referential statement, which essentially said: "There is no proof for the statement with Gödel number G," where G is the Gödel number of that very statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This statement is "this card is unprovable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

*   If the statement is false, then there *is* a proof, which means you have proven that there is no proof, leading to a contradiction and an inconsistent mathematical system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   If the statement is true, then there *is* no proof for it, meaning the mathematical system contains true statements that cannot be proven, making it incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

This established Gödel's first incompleteness theorem: any basic mathematical system capable of fundamental arithmetic will always have true statements within it that cannot be proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. This means truth and provability are not the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

Gödel's second incompleteness theorem further demonstrated that any consistent formal system of mathematics cannot prove its own consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. Combined, these theorems imply that the best one can hope for is a consistent yet incomplete system of mathematics, where a future contradiction could reveal the system was inconsistent all along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

## Alan Turing and Decidability

Hilbert's third question concerned decidability: whether an algorithm exists to always determine if a statement follows from the axioms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. In 1936, Alan Turing addressed this question by inventing the modern computer, known as the Turing machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

A Turing machine is a theoretical mechanical computer capable of performing any imaginable computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. It operates on an infinitely long tape of binary cells, reading, writing, moving, or halting based on a set of internal instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. While simple, its arbitrary memory and program allow it to execute any computable algorithm, making it equivalent in power to modern computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

Turing realized that the decidability problem was analogous to his "halting problem": determining beforehand if a Turing machine program will halt or run into an infinite loop on a particular input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. If the halting problem could be solved, then it would also be possible to decide if a statement followed from axioms, such as the Twin Prime Conjecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

However, Turing proved that a machine capable of solving the halting problem in all cases cannot exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. His proof involved creating a hypothetical "h" machine that could determine if any Turing machine halts. He then modified "h" into "h plus," which would loop infinitely if "h" predicted it would halt, and halt if "h" predicted it would loop. When "h plus" is fed its own code, "h" reaches a contradiction, demonstrating that such a universal halting machine is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

This implies that mathematics is [[undecidability_in_mathematical_systems|undecidable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. There is no algorithm that can always determine whether a statement is derivable from the axioms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. Thus, problems like the Twin Prime Conjecture may remain unsolvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.

## Legacy and Impact

The discoveries of Gödel and Turing revealed a fundamental "hole at the bottom of math," meaning complete certainty is impossible, and true statements will always exist that cannot be proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. While Hilbert's dream of a fully provable mathematics crumbled, the pursuit of these answers led to profound advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

The concept of Turing completeness describes systems powerful enough to do everything a Turing machine can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. Many systems are Turing complete, each with its own analogous halting problem, an undecidable property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Wang tiles:** Their halting problem is whether they will tile the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.
*   **Quantum systems:** The spectral gap question is undecidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
*   **Conway's Game of Life:** Its halting problem is whether a pattern halts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.
*   Airline ticketing systems, Magic: The Gathering, PowerPoint, Excel spreadsheets, and nearly every programming language are also Turing complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

Alan Turing's ideas on computability, stemming from Hilbert's question about decidability, directly led to the invention of the modern computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. During World War II, Turing led the team at Bletchley Park that built machines to crack Nazi codes, an effort estimated to have shortened the war by two to four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>. After the war, Turing, along with John von Neumann, designed the first true programmable electronic computer, ENIAC, based on Turing's designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

These findings transformed the concept of infinity, changed the course of a world war, and directly led to the computational devices that define the modern era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. The strange paradoxes of self-reference, initially seen as flaws, became the bedrock of computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.

On February 15, 2013, an asteroid, heavier than the Eiffel Tower, slammed into Earth's atmosphere over Chelyabinsk, Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It exploded 30 kilometers above the ground, an event brighter than the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Despite its brightness, the explosion was silent for a full 90 seconds due to its high altitude, which tragically worsened the devastation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Impact and Aftermath
Eyewitnesses first saw a smoke trail in the sky, finding it "amazing," until the shockwave hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The shockwave blew out windows, causing 1,500 injuries, many from glass fragments, and damaged thousands of buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Detection Failure and Broader Implications
What made the Chelyabinsk incident particularly "embarrassing" was that scientists had predicted another asteroid, named Duende, of a similar size, would make a close fly-by of Earth on the very same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Duende passed within 27,000 kilometers of Earth's surface 16 hours after the Chelyabinsk event, closer than satellites in geosynchronous orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Despite correctly predicting Duende's approach, they completely missed the unrelated asteroid that exploded over Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

This highlights the [[detection_challenges_of_asteroids|challenges in detecting asteroids]] before they hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Since 1988, over 1,200 asteroids larger than a meter have collided with Earth, yet only five were detected beforehand, none with more than a day's warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The Chelyabinsk meteor itself was only about 20 meters in diameter, roughly the width of two school buses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Asteroids are difficult to spot because they are typically rough and dark, reflecting only about 15% of the light that hits them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The best chance to see them is when they are fully illuminated by the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Over 85% of detected [[potential_threats_from_near_earth_objects|Near Earth Objects]] (NEOs) are found in the 45 degrees of sky directly opposite the sun, known as the opposition effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This means any asteroid approaching from the direction of the sun often cannot be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, which is exactly what happened with Chelyabinsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Impacts
The 50-meter asteroid that formed the Barringer Crater in Arizona, not much larger than the Chelyabinsk object, released energy equivalent to 10 megatons of TNTâ€”over 600 times the energy of the Hiroshima bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This demonstrates that even relatively small asteroids can cause significant damage.

The difficulty in tracking and the limited [[strategies_for_asteroid_deflection|strategies for asteroid deflection]] highlight the ongoing threat posed by such celestial bodies. It is much more hopeful to prioritize detection and tracking of asteroids to understand the threat they pose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

The Dzhanibekov effect, also known as the tennis racket theorem or the intermediate axis theorem, describes a counterintuitive phenomenon of rotating bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This effect involves an object rotating about its intermediate principal axis, causing it to periodically flip 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Discovery by Vladimir Dzhanibekov

In 1985, cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov observed this strange phenomenon while saving the Soviet space station Salyut 7, which had completely shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. After rescuing the space station, Dzhanibekov noticed a wing-nut, as it spun off a bolt, maintained its orientation for a short time before flipping 180 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He observed it continued flipping back and forth at regular intervals without any applied forces or torques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This phenomenon was so strange and counterintuitive that the Russians kept it secret for 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## The Tennis Racket Theorem

Six years later, in 1991, a paper titled "The Twisting Tennis Racket" was published in the *Journal of Dynamics and Differential Equations*, describing a related phenomenon without mentioning the secret Dzhanibekov effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This paper explained that when a tennis racket is flipped in the air, it not only rotates as intended but also makes a half turn around an axis passing through its handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Principal Axes and Moment of Inertia

An object like a tennis racket can spin about three principal axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>:
1.  **Smallest Moment of Inertia**: An axis running through the handle. Spinning around this axis is easiest and results in the fastest angular velocity because mass is distributed closest to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This spin is stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
2.  **Intermediate Moment of Inertia**: An axis running parallel to the head of the racket. Rotation around this axis causes the observed half-twist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This spin is unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
3.  **Greatest Moment of Inertia**: An axis running perpendicular to the head of the racket. Spinning around this axis is slowest because the mass is distributed furthest from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This spin is also stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

This phenomenon requires an object to have three different moments of inertia about its three principal axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Objects with spherical symmetry or only two different moments of inertia (like a spinning ring) will not demonstrate the tennis racket theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. An object that exhibits this effect is called an "asymmetric top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Intuitive Explanation by Terry Tao

While the mathematics behind the intermediate axis theorem is complex, mathematician Terry Tao provided an intuitive explanation in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

Imagine a thin, rigid, massless disc with:
*   Heavy point masses on opposite edges of the x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   Light point masses on opposite edges of the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

This disc has three different moments of inertia: smallest around the x-axis (only light masses move), greatest around the z-axis (all four masses move), and intermediate around the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

When rotating about the y-axis, centripetal forces balance centrifugal forces on the heavy masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. However, if the disc is bumped slightly off the y-axis, the small masses will experience centrifugal forces proportional to their distance from the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Tension forces within the disc ensure the small masses remain orthogonal to the big masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. As these small masses accelerate further from the y-axis, they eventually flip to the opposite side, where centrifugal forces then slow them down, causing them to come to rest before repeating the pattern indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## [[historical_context_and_secrecy_of_the_dzhanibekov_effect | Historical context and secrecy of the Dzhanibekov effect]]

Despite the tennis racket paper claiming the phenomenon was new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, understanding the intermediate axis theorem dates back at least 150 years to Louis Poinsot's "The New Theory of Rotating Bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The reason for the Soviet secrecy was potentially due to Dzhanibekov's subsequent experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. He attached modeling clay to the wing-nut and found it also flipped periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## [[implications_of_the_dzhanibekov_effect_for_planetary_rotation | Implications of the Dzhanibekov effect for planetary rotation]]

The implication from Dzhanibekov's observation was that if the Earth is a spinning ball in space, it too could potentially flip over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This led to speculation, especially around the Mayan prophecies of the end of the world in 2012, with the official Russian federal space agency, RusCosmos, even publishing an article discussing the hypothesis of Earth executing the same overturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

However, the Earth will not flip. For an isolated object spinning in space, angular momentum remains constant, but kinetic energy can be converted into other forms, like heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Spinning about the axis with the smallest moment of inertia means spinning with the greatest kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. As kinetic energy is dissipated, the object will tend to spin about the axis that achieves the minimum kinetic energy, which is the one with the largest moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

The U.S. learned this with Explorer One, their first satellite, which was designed to spin stably about its long axis but rotated end-over-end within hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Its flexible antennas allowed it to dissipate energy, causing it to shift to the axis of maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

The Earth, like Explorer One, dissipates energy internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Over time, it has come to spin about the axis with its maximum moment of inertia, which is stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Most astronomical objects, such as Mars (with its Tharsis Rise at the equator) and asteroids, also spin around their axis with the maximum moment of inertia, confirming its stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

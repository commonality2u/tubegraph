The process of intubation involves inserting a tube into a patient to assist with breathing when they are unable to do so themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">00:08:33</a>. Traditionally, this procedure requires a highly trained medical professional to use a laryngoscope to visualize the trachea and then pass the tube inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">00:08:38</a>. This method can be challenging and time-consuming, with every second counting when a patient is not breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">00:09:02</a>.

## The Vine Robot Solution

Researchers are developing a miniature version of the vine robot to make intubation faster and safer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">00:09:12</a>. This device simplifies the process, potentially allowing individuals with no specific training to easily insert it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">00:09:19</a>.

### How it Works

The vine robot for intubation is designed to be quite compliant due to its soft robotics nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">00:09:55</a>. The main robot grows downwards into the esophagus, while a flexible side branch is designed to head towards the trachea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">00:10:02</a>. This design allows the robot to passively find the correct opening, an example of "mechanical intelligence" where it can navigate even without precise knowledge of the internal shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">00:10:14</a>. Once inserted, intubation is achieved with only a small amount of pressurization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">00:09:35</a>.

### Testing and Future

While not yet tested on living persons, the miniature vine robot has been successfully used in cadaver labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">00:10:27</a>. These tests have demonstrated its ability to move from an idealized version to an actual *in-vivo* situation, successfully intubating a patient model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">00:10:31</a>. The potential of this technology could revolutionize medical procedures requiring internal navigation, as it's one of the many diverse applications of the vine robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">00:13:17</a>.

Anamorphosis is a technique that creates a distorted projection of an object or image, which appears in its proper proportions only when viewed from a specific vantage point or with a particular device, such as a mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This artistic method has been utilized by artists for centuries, possibly millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## Historical Examples of Anamorphosis

### The Ambassadors (1533)

One notable example of anamorphosis is Hans Holbein the Younger's 1533 painting, *The Ambassadors* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. While the painting clearly depicts two prominent figures, a distorted shape is visible across the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This distorted image resolves into a detailed human skull when viewed from a specific angle, either from the top right or bottom left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. It is believed that the painting was intended to be hung in a stairwell, allowing viewers to spot the skull out of the corner of their eye, serving as a reminder of mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Leonardo's Eye

Earlier instances of anamorphosis include Leonardo da Vinci's *Leonardo's Eye*, which assumes its correct form only when viewed from the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Lascaux Cave Paintings

Some scholars suggest that the cave paintings at Lascaux, France, dating back 17,000 years, could be the earliest examples of anamorphic art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Due to the uneven surfaces of the cave walls, the ancient artists might have had to consider how their animal figures would be perceived from various viewing angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Anamorphosis in Illusions

Anamorphosis is also a core principle behind other illusions, such as [[creation_and_implications_of_ames_room_illusion | The Ames Room]], designed by Adelbert Ames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The [[the_ames_window_illusion_and_its_mechanics | Ames window illusion]] and the de Heer circle illusion also utilize this technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. These illusions highlight how our brains interpret visual cues to infer depth, often defaulting to assumptions based on a [[carpentered_world_hypothesis_and_cultural_perception_differences | "carpentered environment"]] even when faced with distorted or ambiguous information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

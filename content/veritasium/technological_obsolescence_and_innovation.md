This article explores how products like cars, phones, and light bulbs have sometimes been intentionally made worse due to a conspiracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It delves into the history of product lifespan, cartel practices, and the concept of planned obsolescence, contrasting it with genuine technological innovation.

## The Centennial Light: An Anomaly

The longest continuously operating light bulb in the world is located at the Livermore Fire Station, number six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This bulb has been on for 120 years, since 1901 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Manufactured by hand shortly after commercial light bulbs were invented, it has run for over a million hours, far exceeding the intended lifespan of modern bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Its longevity was initially dismissed as a ridiculous story by some, who believed that if an everlasting light bulb existed, it would dominate the market despite eventual demand drying up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. However, it turns out that better light bulbs did exist in the past before they were intentionally made worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

The Centennial Light's exceptional lifespan is attributed to several factors:
*   It was produced *before* the era of light bulb cartels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   The filament has always been run at a low power of just four or five watts, serving as a nightlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   Being continuously on reduced thermal cycling, limiting stress from thermal expansion and contraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Early Light Bulb Development

Inventing a viable electric light was challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The typical incandescent design involves passing electric current through a material to make it glow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Less than 5% of electrical energy is converted into light, with the remaining 95% released as heat, effectively making them "heat bulbs" with light as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Filaments can reach temperatures of up to 2,800 Kelvin, half as hot as the surface of the sun, which can cause most materials to melt or burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Key milestones in early light bulb development:
*   **1840s:** Warren De la Rue conceived of putting the filament in a vacuum bulb to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **1879:** Thomas Edison created a bulb with a cotton thread filament that lasted 14 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Other inventors used platinum or carbonized materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Filaments transitioned from carbon to tungsten, known for its high melting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   By the early 1920s, average bulb lifetimes reached 2,000-2,500 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## The Phoebus Cartel and Planned Obsolescence

This increase in longevity stopped in the early 1920s, and lifetimes began to shorten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Formation and Purpose
In December 1924, major light bulb companies including Phillips, International General Electric, Tokyo Electric, OSRAM, and Associated Electric, secretly met in Geneva, Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They formed the Phoebus Cartel, named after the Greek God of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The cartel's stated purpose was to increase standardization and efficiency of light bulbs, even establishing the common screw thread standard used globally today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, evidence indicates their primary motivation was to control the world's light bulb supply for profit and increased sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

The biggest threat to these consolidated corporations was the increasingly long lifespan of light bulbs, which was reducing sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. For example, OSRAM's sales dropped from 63 million bulbs in 1923 to 28 million in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Enforcement and Impact
The cartel members agreed to reduce the lifespan of their bulbs to 1,000 hours, nearly halving the existing average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. To enforce this, manufacturers submitted sample bulbs for testing. Companies were fined if their bulbs lasted significantly longer than 1,000 hours, with a fine of 200 Swiss Francs for every 1,000 bulbs sold if they lasted over 3,000 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Engineers, previously tasked with extending bulb life, were now instructed to decrease it through different materials, filament shapes, and thinner connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This effort was successful; the lifespan of light bulbs steadily decreased, reaching an average of 1,205 hours by 1934 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. As planned, sales for cartel members increased by 25% in the four years after 1926, and profit margins rose as prices remained unchanged despite falling component costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

The Phoebus Cartel was intended to last until 1955 but collapsed in the 1930s due to external competition, non-compliance among members, and the outbreak of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. However, its methods of intentionally shortening product lifespans, known as [[planned_obsolescence_in_consumer_products | planned obsolescence]], persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Modern Manifestations of Planned Obsolescence

### Apple's Practices
[[planned_obsolescence_in_consumer_products | Planned obsolescence]] continues to be a tactic employed by companies today. A notable example is Apple, which was the subject of Casey Neistat's viral video in 2003 regarding an iPod's dead battery after 18 months, with Apple offering a costly repair that made buying a new device more appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This video led to a class-action lawsuit settled out of court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

In 2017, an iOS update intentionally throttled the performance of older iPhones, causing apps to load slower or devices to shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Apple claimed this was to protect batteries and increase longevity, but the issue could have been resolved if batteries were replaceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This led to multiple lawsuits concluding in 2020, with Apple paying hundreds of millions in fines and settlements, an amount likely dwarfed by the extra revenue generated by limiting product lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Theoretical Justifications
Some argue that [[planned_obsolescence_in_consumer_products | planned obsolescence]] isn't solely about greed but can benefit the economy. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, real estate broker Bernard London proposed mandatory [[planned_obsolescence_in_consumer_products | planned obsolescence]] to stimulate employment and economic recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. He envisioned the government assigning a "lease of life" to products like shoes, homes, and machines, after which they would be legally "dead" and destroyed to create demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This seemingly fringe idea reflected anxieties about technological progress causing job displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

This fear was also depicted in the 1951 Oscar-nominated film "The Man in the White Suit," about a scientist who invents a perfect, indestructible fiber that won't stain, break, or fray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Initially excited, factory owners realize they won't sell enough of such durable thread, and workers fear job losses. This leads to a climactic scene where both groups unite to pursue the scientist and destroy his invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

The film's theme may have been inspired by real events. In the 1940s, synthetic nylon replaced silk in stockings, becoming an overnight sensation due to its durability. When manufacturers realized the product was "too good," they instructed engineers to weaken the fiber to shorten its lifespan, mimicking the Phoebus Cartel's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

### The Right to Repair Movement
Consumers are starting to push back against [[planned_obsolescence_in_consumer_products | planned obsolescence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. In the European Union and over 25 U.S. states, proposed legislation aims to establish the "right to repair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. These laws would compel manufacturers to facilitate product repairs by providing information and access to parts, allowing consumers to replace components like batteries or screens at third-party shops without voiding warranties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Dynamic Obsolescence: Fashion-Driven Cycles

Even if the right to repair eliminates artificial obsolescence caused by manufacturing, another form of obsolescence, driven by consumer desire, may persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

### The Automotive Industry
Henry Ford initially envisioned the Model T (released 1908) as an affordable, durable "workhorse" that would not wear out, stating in 1922, "We want the man who buys one of our cars never to have to buy another, we never make an improvement that renders any previous model obsolete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

However, by 1920, 55% of American families owned a car, and an economic downturn affected sales for both Ford and General Motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. In 1921, DuPont, a chemical and paint company, gained control of General Motors and began experimenting with different car colors, a departure from Ford's "any color you like so long as it's black" policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. By 1924, GM released cars in various colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

Soon after, GM introduced the strategy of changing car colors each new year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. The goal was not only to make Ford's Model T look dated but also to make GM's *own* cars feel outdated annually, encouraging customers to trade up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. GM's head of design, Harley Earl, openly referred to this as "dynamic obsolescence," aiming to reduce the average car ownership span from five years (1934) to two years (1955), aspiring for a "perfect score" of one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. By 1955, General Motors was the world's most valuable company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Fashion's Influence
This playbook of introducing new styles and colors with marginal [[technological_innovations_in_micromouse_design | technological improvement]] has been adopted by companies like Apple, which releases new iPhone models annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This strategy is inspired by the fashion industry, where genuine innovation is often limited, so urgency to buy is created by designs that last only one season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. When styles are exhausted, previous decades' designs are recycled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. The iPhone's fluctuating edge designs (rounded, then squared, then rounded, now squared again) illustrate this cyclical trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. The point is that with design and styling, there is no "best," only "different," which is enough to motivate continuous purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## The Future of Innovation

The only type of obsolescence that should be supported is genuine [[technological_innovations_in_micromouse_design | technological innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. In the last 20 years, light bulbs have evolved from incandescent (unchanged for 100 years) to compact fluorescent, and now to LED technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. LEDs use only a tenth of the energy and can last 10 to 50 times longer than incandescent bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. This represents a significant leap forward, effectively bringing us to a point of what is "essentially an everlasting light bulb" due to technological advancement, not a cartel's manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

On April 10th, 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope released the first-ever image of a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This image provides a crucial test for whether the [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes|General Theory of Relativity]] accurately predicts phenomena in strong gravity regimes around a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Event Horizon

The **event horizon** is defined as the boundary from which not even light, fired radially away from the black hole, can be detected by an outside observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Once inside, all paths, or "world lines," ultimately lead to the singularity at the center of the black hole, with no possibility of escape, even for light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The radius of this event horizon is known as the **Schwarzschild radius** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

If a black hole existed in isolation with nothing around it, it would be invisible, as it would absorb all electromagnetic radiation that falls onto it, preventing any image from being formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Accretion Disk and Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO)

The supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, Sagittarius A*, is surrounded by an accretion disk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This disk consists of dust and gas swirling chaotically at millions of degrees and at a significant fraction of the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The black hole feeds on this matter, growing larger over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

However, the accretion disk does not extend all the way to the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This is due to the existence of an **innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)** for matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. For a non-spinning black hole, this orbit is located at three Schwarzschild radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. If matter moves inside this orbit, it rapidly spirals into the black hole's center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Photon Sphere

Unlike matter, light, having no mass, can orbit even closer to the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Photons can orbit at **1.5 Schwarzschild radii** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This region is referred to as the **photon sphere**, which is a sphere of photon orbits around the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Theoretically, if one could stand at the photon sphere, they would be able to look forward and see the back of their own head as photons complete the orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The photon sphere represents an unstable orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Eventually, photons in this region will either spiral into the singularity or spiral outwards towards infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Black Hole Shadow and Relativistic Effects

The apparent "black" shadow observed in black hole images is not simply the event horizon, the photon sphere, or the ISCO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The complex nature of this shadow arises because the black hole significantly warps [[spacetime_curvature_and_the_shape_of_the_universe|space-time]] around it, causing light rays to follow [[curved_spacetime_and_geodesics|curved paths]] instead of straight lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Light rays coming in from an observer that cross the event horizon are absorbed, contributing to the dark region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Even light rays passing just above the event horizon or at the distance of the photon sphere will be bent and eventually fall into the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

For a light ray to reach an observer without falling into the black hole, it must come in at a distance of at least **2.6 Schwarzschild radii** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Such a ray will graze the photon sphere at its closest approach before continuing to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Consequently, the resulting shadow we perceive is approximately **2.6 times larger than the event horizon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

The center of this shadow directly maps to the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Due to the extreme bending of light, observers can actually "see" the entirety of the black hole's event horizon, including its backside, mapped onto a ring within this shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Furthermore, light can loop around the black hole multiple times, creating infinite, progressively thinner, annular rings of the event horizon as one approaches the edge of the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The "first light" visible corresponds to light rays that just graze the photon sphere before reaching our telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Viewing Angles and Relativistic Beaming

The appearance of the black hole's image can change significantly depending on the viewing angle relative to the accretion disk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. If viewed edge-on, the warping of [[spacetime_curvature_and_the_shape_of_the_universe|space-time]] by the black hole causes light from the back of the accretion disk to bend over and under the black hole, making it visible to the observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This effect can create an image resembling the black hole portrayed in the movie *Interstellar* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Additionally, light from the accretion disk can go around the back of the black hole and graze the photon sphere before reaching the observer, creating very thin rings of light around the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

Another critical [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_the_black_hole|relativistic effect]] is **relativistic beaming** (or Doppler beaming) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Because the matter in the accretion disk moves at speeds close to that of light, the side of the disk moving towards the observer will appear significantly brighter than the side moving away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This phenomenon results in a bright spot within the black hole image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

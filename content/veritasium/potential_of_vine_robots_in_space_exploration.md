Vine robots present a promising option for [[applications_in_aerospace_and_space_technology | space exploration]], particularly for studying planetary surfaces and subsurface environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Their unique growth mechanism allows them to overcome challenges faced by traditional burrowing robots.

## Advantages for Planetary Exploration

Vine robots are considered an attractive option for NASA due to their ability to grow into granular materials like sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. This capability is achieved by blowing a jet of air out of the robot's front, which fluidizes the sand and reduces resistance, allowing the robot to extend through the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

A significant advantage of vine robots for [[space_exploration_challenges | space exploration]] is their method of "tip extension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Unlike probes that rely on hammering or friction, a vine robot's base remains at the surface while it extends downwards, meaning it does not depend on the interaction with the surrounding material to progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

## Comparison to Mars InSight Mission

The potential of vine robots is highlighted when compared to the challenges encountered by past [[space_exploration_challenges | space exploration]] missions. For instance, the Mars InSight mission featured a heat probe designed to hammer its way into the Martian core to detect temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

However, the InSight probe faced a critical issue: it got stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. The material it encountered on Mars was more cohesive than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. The internal mechanism would wind up and pound down, but insufficient friction between the probe and the Martian soil prevented it from making any progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

The vine robot's tip extension method directly addresses this problem by eliminating the reliance on external friction for burrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This makes them a more reliable solution for probing unknown or unpredictable extraterrestrial terrains.

Ben Conde is a professional yoyoer who launched a YouTube channel dedicated to advanced yoyoing techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. His channel showcases his ability to perform complex maneuvers, often described as "yoyoing like a crazy person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Mastering Advanced Techniques

Conde is particularly known for his proficiency in [[stringless_yoyo_techniques | stringless yoyo techniques]], executing "insane things" with a yoyo even when the string is not connected to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. These techniques involve skilled manipulation to bind the string back to the yoyo's spool, allowing it to roll up the string and return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. He can also release the yoyo by throwing it out and upwards without pulling back, allowing it to unspool completely while maintaining a high rate of rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

The [[physics_of_yoyoing | physics of yoyoing]] behind these tricks relies on several principles:
*   **Rotational Energy** When released, the yoyo unspools, converting gravitational potential energy into kinetic and rotational energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Yoyos can spin very fast, up to around 6,000 revolutions per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **[[Gyroscopic stability in yoyos | Gyroscopic Stability]]** This high spin rate provides [[gyroscopic_stability_in_yoyos | gyroscopic stability]], meaning the yoyo's axis of rotation is maintained despite disturbances like a breeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **[[Friction and angular momentum in yoyos | Friction and Angular Momentum]]** To catch the yoyo, Ben can lodge the string in its gap, catching on internal silicone [[friction_and_angular_momentum_in_yoyos | friction]] pads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Even without these pads, wrapping the string around the axle creates significant [[friction_and_angular_momentum_in_yoyos | friction]], similar to how ropes around bollards hold ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The belt friction equation explains how the force the string can exert increases exponentially with the angle the string makes around the axle, allowing him to pull it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Dedication and Achievements

Ben Conde has dedicated years of his life to perfecting the skills demonstrated on his channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. He humorously notes that his skills were developed during "a lot of like lonely Saturday nights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

One of his most cherished yoyo moments was his freestyle performance in 2011, which led to the crowd giving a standing ovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This emotional experience brought tears to his eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

> "My freestyle in 2011 the crowd stood up and it felt good. It brought tears to my eyes but I went back to my hotel room to cry 'cause I was happy. It was a good moment." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>

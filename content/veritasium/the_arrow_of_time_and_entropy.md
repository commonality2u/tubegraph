From: [[veritasium]] <br/> 

[[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | Entropy]], a concept governing phenomena from molecular collisions to galactic evolution, is considered one of the most important yet least understood concepts in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It potentially determines the direction of time and may even be the reason for life's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Sun's Gift to Earth

When asked what the Earth receives from the Sun, common responses include light, heat, warmth, vitamin D, and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. While the Earth receives a certain amount of energy from the Sun daily, it radiates an exactly equal amount of energy back into space over most of its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. If this weren't the case, the Earth's temperature would drastically increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This equilibrium leads to the question of what the Earth truly gains from the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The answer lies in a concept that goes beyond mere energy transfer.

## The Birth of Thermodynamics

The foundation for understanding this concept traces back to the winter of 1813 during Napoleon's reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Sadi Carnot, a 17-year-old student and son of one of Napoleon's generals, became interested in the efficiency of steam engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. At the time, French steam engine designs lagged behind those of other nations, particularly Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Carnot sought to improve their efficiency, which was around 3% for converting thermal energy into useful mechanical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Carnot's Ideal Heat Engine

Carnot's key insight involved an ideal heat engine, one without friction or environmental losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This engine operates between a hot and a cold reservoir, using a chamber filled with air and a piston connected to a flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
The cycle involves:
1.  Heat flowing from the hot bar to the air, causing it to expand and push the piston up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
2.  Air continuing to expand without heat input, causing its temperature to decrease to that of the cold bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
3.  The flywheel pushing the piston down, compressing the air and transferring heat to the cold bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
4.  Further compression by the flywheel, increasing the air's temperature back to just below that of the hot bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

This process converts heat from the hot bar into the flywheel's energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Carnot's ideal engine is remarkable because it is completely reversible; running it in reverse returns everything to its original state with no additional energy input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Efficiency and Absolute Temperature

Despite being reversible, Carnot's ideal engine is not 100% efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Its efficiency is determined by the heat flowing in from the hot bar minus the heat flowing out to the cold bar, divided by the heat input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The hot gas exerts greater pressure, meaning more work is done by the gas than by the piston on the cold side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Efficiency can be improved by increasing the hot side's temperature or decreasing the cold side's temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

Lord Kelvin used Carnot's engine as the basis for an [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | absolute temperature]] scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. He conceived of [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | absolute zero]], where gas particles effectively stop moving, exerting no pressure, and no heat would be lost, theoretically leading to a 100% efficient engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Using the Kelvin scale, the efficiency of an ideal heat engine depends only on the temperatures of the hot and cold sides, not on the materials or design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Achieving 100% efficiency would require infinite temperature on the hot side or [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | absolute zero]] on the cold side, both practically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Heat must be dumped into the cold bar to return the piston, preventing all energy from staying in the flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Real engines fall short of theoretical maximums due to friction, heat dissipation to the environment, and non-constant temperature heat transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. When energy spreads out, becoming less usable and irreversible, it cannot be easily reclaimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Energy is most usable when concentrated and least usable when spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Clausius and the Laws of Thermodynamics

Decades later, German physicist Rudolf Clausius studied Carnot's work and devised a way to measure how "spread out" energy is, naming this quantity [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Low [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] corresponds to concentrated energy (e.g., in a hot bar), while high [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] means energy has dispersed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. A higher [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] state contains the same amount of energy, but in a less available form for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

In 1865, Clausius summarized the first two laws of thermodynamics:
1.  The energy of the universe is constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
2.  The [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] of the universe tends to a maximum; energy spreads out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

The [[Second Law of Thermodynamics and Disorder | Second Law of Thermodynamics]] explains why hot things cool down, gas expands, and perpetual motion machines are impossible: the amount of usable energy in a closed system constantly decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. While often described as disorder, [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] is best understood as the tendency of energy to spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Boltzmann and the Microscopic View of Entropy

The time-dependence of [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] – why energy spreads out in one direction – is a key question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Ludwig Boltzmann offered an important insight: heat flowing from cold to hot, though decreasing [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]], is not impossible, merely improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

Consider two small metal bars, one hot (7 energy packets) and one cold (3 energy packets), each with eight atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Energy packets hop randomly between atoms and bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. While a state where the initially cold bar becomes hotter is possible, it is significantly less likely than an even distribution of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. As the number of atoms and energy packets increases, the probability of such an improbable event approaches zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. With quadrillions of atoms and packets in everyday solids, heat flowing from cold to hot effectively never happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

This concept is analogous to a Rubik's Cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. There's only one "solved" state, a few "almost solved" states, and quintillions of "random" states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Without conscious effort, random turns will almost always move the cube from an unlikely (solved) state to a more likely (messy) state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

## Entropy, Order, and Life

If energy naturally spreads out and things get messier, how can ordered structures like air-conditioned houses (where the interior cools and exterior heats) or life itself exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>? A local decrease in [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] is possible, but it must be accompanied by a greater increase in [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. For air conditioning, this is achieved at a power plant where concentrated chemical energy from coal is dissipated, increasing the [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] of the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

The Earth is not a closed system; it receives a steady stream of low-[[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]], concentrated energy from the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. The energy received from the Sun is more useful and clumped together than the equal amount of energy radiated back into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. This low-[[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] energy powers life on Earth:
*   Plants capture it to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.
*   Animals eat plants (or other animals) to maintain their bodies and move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   At each step, energy becomes more spread out, increasing [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

Ultimately, all solar energy reaching Earth is converted into thermal energy and radiated back into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. The increase in [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] is seen in the photon exchange: for each high-energy photon received from the Sun, Earth emits about 20 lower-energy photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. All Earthly processes, from plant growth to human activity, are part of this conversion from fewer high-energy photons to many low-energy photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Without a source of concentrated energy and a way to discard spread-out energy, life would be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

It has even been suggested that life is a consequence of the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics and Disorder | Second Law of Thermodynamics]], acting as a mechanism to accelerate the universe's natural tendency toward maximum [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. For example, the surface of seawater produces significantly more [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] when organic matter like cyanobacteria is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. Jeremy England proposed that a constant stream of clumped energy favors structures that dissipate that energy, eventually leading to the emergence of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

## Cosmic Entropy and the Arrow of Time

The Sun's low [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] ultimately originated from the universe itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. The universe's total [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] is increasing, meaning it was lower in the past, all the way back to the Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. This is known as the "past hypothesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

Though the early universe was hot, dense, and remarkably uniform (temperatures varying by only 0.001%), this seemingly mixed state was actually one of low [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] when gravity is considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Gravity tends to clump matter together, so a uniform distribution of matter was an extremely unlikely, and thus low-[[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]], state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

As the universe expanded and cooled, matter clumped into denser regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. This process converted enormous amounts of potential energy into kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. As matter collided, kinetic energy transformed into heat, reducing usable energy and increasing [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. The formation of stars, planets, galaxies, and life all contributed to this ongoing increase in [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

### Black Holes and Entropy

In 1972, Jacob Bekenstein proposed that [[Black Holes and Entropy | black holes]] are another significant source of [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]], proportional to their surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. This idea was initially met with skepticism because if [[Black Holes and Entropy | black holes]] had [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]], they should also have a temperature and emit radiation, contradicting their "black" nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

Stephen Hawking set out to disprove Bekenstein but instead found that [[Black Holes and Entropy | black holes]] do emit radiation (Hawking radiation) and have a temperature, confirming Bekenstein's hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. Hawking refined Bekenstein's proposal, calculating the precise amount of [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] [[Black Holes and Entropy | black holes]] contain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

The supermassive [[Black Holes and Entropy | black hole]] at the Milky Way's center alone has about 10<sup>91</sup> Boltzmann constants of [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]], which is 1,000 times more than the early observable universe and 10 times more than all other particles combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. All [[Black Holes and Entropy | black holes]] collectively account for 3 x 10<sup>104</sup> Boltzmann constants of [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]], meaning almost all the universe's [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] is tied up in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

## The Arrow of Time

The universe began with extremely low [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]], and its continuous increase drives everything that happens: planetary systems forming, galaxies merging, stars dying, and life flourishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. These processes happen in only one direction; we never observe them in reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. This clear distinction between past and future, known as the arrow of time, arises directly from the fact that the universe is constantly moving from unlikely (low-[[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]]) states to more likely (high-[[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]]) states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

This process is expected to continue until the energy is so completely spread out that no interesting events can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. This eventual state is known as the [[Role of Energy and Entropy in Life and the Universe | heat death of the universe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. In this distant future, after all [[Black Holes and Entropy | black holes]] have evaporated, the universe will be in its most probable state, and the arrow of time itself will disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

## Entropy and Complexity

While maximum [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] signifies low complexity, low [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] does not necessarily mean maximum complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. Complexity, like the swirling patterns when milk is poured into tea, emerges in the intermediate stages as energy spreads out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. Both very low and very high [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] states exhibit low complexity; complex structures appear and thrive in the middle ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. Since we find ourselves in this complex, middle-entropy state, it is an opportunity to make use of the low [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] that is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

Understanding [[Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | entropy]] allows us to comprehend phenomena from a cooling cup of tea to the evolution of the entire universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

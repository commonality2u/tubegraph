The world contains mysterious places visible from high above, like electric blue ponds in the middle of the Utah desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These technicolor pools are filled with something prized throughout human history: potash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. While historically used for various purposes, its role as a fertilizer has profoundly impacted global agriculture and human populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

## From Ash to Element: The Discovery of Potassium

Potash originally referred to a crystalline substance created by burning hardwood, collecting the ash, adding water, and allowing the water to evaporate from the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This substance was chemically known as potassium carbonate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

In 1807, British scientist [[the_history_and_discovery_of_potash_and_potassium | Humphry Davy]] discovered a new element by putting electrodes into damp potash and connecting them to a battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. He observed tiny metal globules form and spontaneously catch fire as they burst through the potash crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Davy named this new element potassium, directly from the word potash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Pure elemental potassium is a soft, reactive metal that must be kept submerged under oil to prevent it from reacting with water in the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It reacts violently with water, forming potassium hydroxide and hydrogen gas, releasing significant heat that causes the hydrogen gas to spontaneously combust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Potash as Fertilizer

While people often associate potassium with bananas or Gatorade, it's not pure elemental potassium found in these foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The term "potash" has evolved to become a catch-all term for various potassium-containing compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Historically, potash was used for making soap and glass, and its derivative, potassium nitrate (saltpeter), was a core ingredient in fireworks and gunpowder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. In early America, potash was the main chemical product and a substantial source of revenue, leading to the decimation of forests across Europe and the eastern U.S. due to the large amount of lumber required to produce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The demand for potash was so high that the newly-independent U.S. government issued its first-ever patent in 1790 for an improved process for making potash, signed by President [[historical_significance_of_potash_in_early_american_industries | George Washington]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

A significant shift occurred in 1861 when Germany began producing potassium from a different source: natural mineral rock, specifically potassium chloride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This discovery led to Germany establishing a near monopoly on the potash supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### The Agricultural Breakthrough

With abundant supplies, Germany started experimenting with new uses for potash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. They found that sprinkling this material on farmers' fields acted as an excellent fertilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This is because potassium, along with nitrogen and phosphorus, helps crops grow significantly larger and makes them more drought-resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Geopolitical Impact and New Mining Methods

Germany's potash monopoly had global ramifications. In 1910, just four years before World War I, Germany cut off potash exports, depriving countries that had become dependent on it to feed their growing populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This prompted the U.S. in 1911 to appropriate money to find domestic sources, leading to discoveries near Searles Lake, California; Carlsbad, New Mexico; and Moab, Utah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

Initially, potash rocks were mined deep underground, similar to coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. However, this method proved dangerous, as demonstrated by a tragic explosion in 1963 at a Moab, Utah, potash mine, caused by the ignition of natural gas, resulting in 18 fatalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

A safer method, called solution mining, was discovered in 1964 by a Canadian mining company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This process involves pumping water from the Colorado River almost 4,000 feet underground to dissolve the potash salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. The resulting briny solution is then forced back to the surface and pumped into large evaporation ponds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. In these ponds, the water evaporates under the hot Utah sun and dry air, leaving behind the potash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The water molecules effectively act as "miners," retrieving the potash without human miners having to go underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

The blue color of these evaporation ponds is due to copper sulfate added to the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. This serves two purposes: it prevents the growth of algae and other living organisms, and its dark blue color absorbs more sunlight, which accelerates water evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Once the water fully evaporates, a white crystalline substance, the potash, remains and is scraped up by vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. The Paradox Basin alone holds an estimated 2 billion tons of potash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## Societal Impact

Today, fertilizer, with potash as a key component, supports half of the world's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. This increased efficiency in food production means that the planet can support more people and frees up human time for pursuits beyond merely finding food, allowing for the development of arts, music, sports, and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Potash is an irreplaceable substance that has helped shape the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. The [[the_economic_and_environmental_impacts_of_potash_production | economic and environmental impacts of potash production]], particularly its role in enabling widespread agriculture, underscore its critical importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

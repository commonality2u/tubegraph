The kilogram is currently the only base unit in the International System of Units (SI) that is defined by a physical object. To address the inherent instability of this definition, scientists have been working on [[Alternate Approaches to Defining the Kilogram | alternative approaches]], including the use of a highly precise silicon sphere.

### The Problem with the Current Kilogram Definition
The current definition of the kilogram dates back to 1889, when it was defined by the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK), affectionately known as Le Grand K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:30">[03:51:30]</a>. This object is a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder, stored in a climate-controlled vault in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

The fundamental issue with defining a unit of measurement by a physical object is its inherent instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. Replicas of Le Grand K, created at the same time and stored under similar conditions, have shown mass divergences over time, by as much as 50 micrograms – roughly the weight of a fingerprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. This indicates that the mass of the platinum-iridium cylinders is not stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. This instability poses a significant problem because four of the seven base SI units, as well as many derived units like Newtons, Joules, Volts, and Watts, depend on the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. The goal is to eliminate the kilogram's dependence on a physical object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

### The Silicon-28 Sphere
A potential solution to redefine the kilogram involves a 1-kilogram sphere made of highly purified silicon-28 atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. The raw material for this sphere was worth one million Euros due to its extreme purity, containing only one isotope of silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. After being precisely sculpted, it is considered priceless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

#### The [[the_worlds_roundest_object__a_silicon_sphere | World's Roundest Object]]
This silicon sphere is the roundest object in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. If it were scaled up to the size of the Earth, the difference between its highest "mountain" and lowest "valley" would be only about 14 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

#### Creation of the Sphere
Creating such a perfect sphere involves starting with an oversized sphere and progressively grinding it finer and finer using abrasives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. This process is likened to "massaging atoms," controlling the object's shape at an atomic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. The sphere is chosen because it is a simple object whose entire dimension can be characterized by knowing its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.

#### Measuring the Sphere
Once made, its diameter is accurately measured using a laser system, where the sphere is placed in the center of a cavity and lasers measure the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.

### Redefining the Kilogram with the Silicon Sphere
The approach using the silicon sphere aims to define the kilogram by counting the exact number of atoms within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. While scientists cannot physically count the atoms, they can calculate the number because the material is a perfect crystal of silicon with no voids or dislocations, and the atom spacing in silicon is known to high precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. By knowing the sphere's diameter, its volume can be determined, and subsequently, the number of atoms it contains (approximately 2.15 x 10^25 atoms for a 1kg sphere) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

This method allows for the redefinition of Avogadro's constant. Currently, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram (number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. However, with the silicon sphere, the number of silicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then, in turn, define the kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

If this redefinition occurs, the kilogram would be defined not by a physical object, but by a concept – a specific, fixed number of silicon-28 atoms. This means that even if the silicon spheres were lost or damaged, the definition of the kilogram would remain unaffected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. The official definition could then state: "a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

### Complementary Approaches
This approach using the silicon sphere is complementary to another method for redefining the kilogram, which involves fixing Planck's constant using a Watt Balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. Both approaches provide a check on each other, and if they show good agreement and reduce uncertainties to about 20 micrograms, the kilogram could be redefined as an unchanging unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

### Historical Context of the Kilogram
The concept of a base unit of mass dates back to the French Revolution. The "grave" was the original name for the base unit of mass in the metric system (SI units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. In 1793, a commission including Antoine Lavoisier defined the unit as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting temperature of ice (a liter of ice water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. The name "grave" came from the Latin "gravitas," meaning weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

Due to political climate, the name was changed to "gramme" (a thousandth of a grave) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. However, a gram proved too small, leading to the invention of the "kilogram" (a thousand grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This is why the kilogram is the only base SI unit with a prefix in its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

In 1799, the kilogram was refined to be the mass of a liter of water at 4 degrees Celsius (its densest temperature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. A pure platinum cylinder was created to match this mass, known as the Kilogram of the Archives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. At this point, the kilogram's definition shifted from the volume of water to this physical artifact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Remarkably, the original artifact was accurate to within the margin of error of a grain of rice compared to its water definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. Antoine Lavoisier, who was involved in the initial definition, also conceived of silicon as an element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.

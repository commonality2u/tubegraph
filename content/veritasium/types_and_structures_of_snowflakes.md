Snowflakes are intricate ice crystals that form from water vapor freezing into ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. Despite their complex and diverse appearances, they all arise from fundamental physical principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

## Fundamental Structure

All snowflakes share a basic six-fold radial symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This fundamental hexagonal structure originates at the molecular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>:
*   **Water Molecule Polarity** Water molecules have a bent shape, with the oxygen atom being slightly negative and the hydrogen atoms slightly positive because oxygen attracts electrons more strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **Hydrogen Bonds** Due to these opposite charges, hydrogen from one water molecule is attracted to oxygen from another, forming hydrogen bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. This attraction dictates how water molecules lock into place when they freeze, creating a hexagonal molecular lattice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

### Growth Mechanism

The hexagonal molecular lattice forms the basis of the macroscopic hexagonal crystal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.
*   **Faceted Growth** When water vapor molecules hit a smooth, flat surface of an ice crystal (facet surface), they tend to bounce off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Conversely, on rough areas with "dangling molecular bonds," molecules are more likely to stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. This differential sticking probability causes rough areas to fill in quickly, while flat areas grow slowly, resulting in a faceted shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. This process transforms the quantum mechanics of a water molecule into a visible hexagonal prism of ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.
*   **Hexagonal Prism** A developing snowflake initially forms a hexagonal prism with two basal facets (top and bottom) and six prism facets (around the sides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
    *   If basal facets grow faster, a column forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.
    *   If prism facets grow faster, a flat snowflake forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   **Branching** As a seed crystal grows, nearby water droplets evaporate and deposit molecules onto its surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. The corners of the hexagonal prism extend further into the humid air, causing them to grow faster. This creates a positive feedback loop, leading to the development of six radial branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. Secondary branches can also form at the corners of these primary branches for the same reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

On average, a single snowflake requires approximately 100,000 droplets and takes 30 to 45 minutes to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. Snowflakes are typically millimeters in diameter but only micrometers thick, with edges as narrow as razorblades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

## Diversity of Forms

While the iconic six-pointed star is well-known, snowflakes take on many different forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. These include:
*   Hollow columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>
*   Needles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>
*   Cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>
*   Bullets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>
*   Capped columns, which begin as columns and then grow plates on either end due to temperature changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

[[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]] has identified 35 different types of snowflakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Historically, classifications have ranged from 41 types to as many as 108 by some Japanese physicists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. These diverse shapes appear spontaneously without a genetic blueprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, simply as water vapor freezes into ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

### The Nakaya Diagram

[[history_and_photography_of_snowflakes | Ukichiro Nakaya]] systematically studied snowflakes in the 1930s at the University of Hokkaido, discovering that snowflake types are determined by temperature and level of supersaturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. His findings are summarized in the [[science_behind_snowflake_formation | Nakaya Diagram]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. The diagram shows a complex pattern:
*   Around -2 Celsius: Plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>
*   At -5 Celsius: Columns and needles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>
*   At -15 Celsius: Plates again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>
*   Below -20 Celsius: Columns and plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>

The [[science_behind_snowflake_formation | Nakaya Diagram]] allows for understanding a rough history of any snowflake, as its shape reveals the conditions under which it grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. For example, capped columns often form in weather patterns where a cloud moves upward, starting as columns at warmer temperatures (-6 to -10 C) and then growing branches and plates as it cools further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

This explains the intricacy of snowflakes: the temperature and humidity at each moment of growth determine the structures formed in that moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. The perfect symmetry within a single snowflake is not due to one side knowing what the other is doing, but because all parts of the crystal grow under identical conditions at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>. Different snowflakes, however, experience unique paths and conditions, leading to the adage that no two snowflakes are alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.

## Molecular Explanation for Growth Forms

For decades, the specific reasons for the varying growth forms across temperatures, as shown in the [[science_behind_snowflake_formation | Nakaya Diagram]], remained a mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. [[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Ken Libbrecht]]'s hypothesis offers an explanation rooted in nucleation barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.

*   **Nucleation Barriers** Crystal growth on smooth, flat facets is difficult due to nucleation barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. A critical density of additional molecules is required to form a stable "island" that can add a new layer to the crystal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.
*   **Facet-Specific Barriers** The nucleation barrier differs for the basal and prism facets of a hexagonal ice prism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.
    *   If the prism facet's nucleation barrier is lower, they grow faster, leading to plate-like structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.
    *   If the basal facet's nucleation barrier is lower, they grow faster, leading to column-like structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.
*   **Temperature Dependence** The nucleation barriers of ice vary with temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.
    *   At around -2 Celsius, prism facets have a lower barrier, resulting in plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.
    *   Below -20 Celsius, basal facets have a lower barrier, resulting in columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>.

[[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Libbrecht]] proposes that these nucleation barriers behave differently for very narrow facets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. Narrow basal facets experience a dip in their nucleation barrier around -4 Celsius, while narrow prism facets have a dip at -15 Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>. This effect, where water molecules diffusing from rough edges onto a narrow facet can exceed the critical density for nucleation, effectively lowers the barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>. [[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Libbrecht]]'s experiments validate this hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>, providing a comprehensive explanation for the diverse columnar and plate-like forms of snowflakes across different temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>.

### [[creating_snowflakes_in_the_lab | Lab-Grown Snowflakes]]

[[creating_snowflakes_in_the_lab | Creating snowflakes in the lab]] allows scientists like [[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Dr. Ken Libbrecht]] to precisely control conditions like temperature and humidity to grow "designer snowflakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. By manipulating these variables, specific features like branches can be induced or suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Lab-grown snowflakes often exhibit crisper, sharper facets than natural ones, as they avoid the evaporation and wear that occurs during their fall from the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

The ability to control the environment has even allowed [[ken_libbrechts_research_on_snowflakes | Libbrecht]] to grow "identical twin snowflakes," which, while not perfectly identical, are remarkably similar due to experiencing nearly the same growth conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

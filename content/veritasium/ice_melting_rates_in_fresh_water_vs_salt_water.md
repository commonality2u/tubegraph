When comparing the melting rates of identical ice cubes placed in fresh water and salt water, the ice cube in fresh water will melt faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. This phenomenon can seem perplexing, as salt is commonly used to melt ice on roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Experimental Setup

To observe this, two cups are filled with regular fresh water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Approximately one tablespoon of salt (sodium chloride) is added to one of the cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. The addition of salt to water consumes energy, which initially lowers the temperature of the solution slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Therefore, it's important to allow the salt solution to sit for a while and return to room temperature before adding the ice cubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

## Explanation of Melting Rates

The difference in melting rates is attributed to the density differences between the melted ice water and the surrounding liquid, which affects heat transfer through convection.

### In Fresh Water

As an ice cube melts in fresh water, the cold water produced from the melting ice is denser than the surrounding room-temperature fresh water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. This denser, cold water sinks to the bottom of the glass, creating a convection current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. As the cold water descends, it pulls warmer, less dense fresh water from the bottom of the cup upwards to replace it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. This continuous circulation brings more warm water into contact with the ice cube, thereby melting it faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

### In Salt Water

Conversely, when an ice cube melts in salt water, the fresh water produced from the ice is less dense than the surrounding salt water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Instead of sinking, this less dense, cold fresh water tends to stay around the ice cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. This layer of cold, fresh water effectively insulates the ice cube from the warmer salt water around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. As a result, less warm water reaches the ice cube, causing it to melt more slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

## Demonstration Challenges

An initial attempt to demonstrate this using food coloring dropped onto clear ice cubes was deemed unclear, as food coloring itself might float on salt water and sink in fresh water regardless of the ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. A more effective demonstration involves using colored ice cubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. With colored ice cubes, the currents of cold water streaming down in the fresh water cup are clearly visible, while they are absent in the salt water cup, confirming the density-driven convection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

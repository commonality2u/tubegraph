For a long time, it was believed that every object follows a single, well-defined trajectory through space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, this is not the case; everything actually explores all possible paths simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. This fundamental concept emerged from the [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | birth of quantum mechanics]], and at its heart lies a quantity called action, and specifically, [[principle_of_least_action_in_quantum_mechanics | Planck's constant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

## The Problem of Light: From Beach to Blackbody

Consider a thought experiment: running and swimming to rescue a friend in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. The shortest path (straight line) is not the fastest because running speed differs from swimming speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. The optimal path, which minimizes travel time, is somewhere in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. This mathematical relationship is identical to the law governing light passing from one medium to another; light also takes the fastest path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

The puzzling question is, how does light "know" to minimize its journey time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>? Initially, it might seem that light simply obeys local rules, changing direction upon encountering a new medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. However, this perspective is incomplete. Light, electrons, protons, and all [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum particles]] truly explore all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. The appearance of single, well-defined trajectories is "the most convincing illusion nature has ever devised" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

This realization began with the problem of blackbody radiation at the turn of the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. German scientists, trying to maximize visible light from hot filaments for electric lighting, studied how different materials emitted light as a function of temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Above 500°C, all materials glowed similarly with an almost identical distribution of light, peaking at shorter wavelengths with increasing temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

The theoretical model for this phenomenon was a "blackbody" – a hole in a metal cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Within this cavity, electrons in the walls emit electromagnetic waves that form standing waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. Classical theory, represented by the Rayleigh-Jeans law, predicted that the number of standing waves (and thus energy) would increase infinitely at shorter wavelengths, leading to the "ultraviolet catastrophe" – a prediction that contradicted experimental data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

## Max Planck's Desperate Act: The Quantum of Action

Max Planck, despite being told physics was "essentially a complete science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>, struggled for three years to find a theoretical explanation for blackbody radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. In an "act of desperation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>, he defied classical physics, which stated that electromagnetic wave energy depends only on amplitude and could take any arbitrary value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

Planck hypothesized that energy could only come in discrete multiples of a smallest amount – a "quantum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. Crucially, he made the energy of one quantum directly proportional to its frequency: E = hf, where 'h' is a constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. This restriction solved the ultraviolet catastrophe; at higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths), the energy of a quantum becomes large, meaning fewer atoms have enough energy to emit it, causing the spectrum to drop to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

Planck's formula perfectly matched experimental data by tuning 'h' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. However, he was troubled by his own discovery, viewing it as a mathematical trick without a clear physical meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. He dedicated himself to finding an interpretation, and eventually, he realized that his new constant, 'h', had the units of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. Planck proposed that any change in nature would occur in whole multiples of this "quantum of action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.

## The Spread of Quantization and the Wave Nature of Matter

Planck's constant initially received little attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a> until Albert [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | Einstein]] claimed in 1905 that Planck's theory implied light actually comes in discrete packets, or photons, each with energy 'hf' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. Einstein used this to explain the photoelectric effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

Eight years later, Niels [[historical_development_of_quantum_mechanics | Bohr]] applied the idea of quantization to the atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. To explain why electrons don't spiral into the nucleus, he "ad hoc" quantized the electron's orbital angular momentum, requiring it to be a multiple of h/2π (or h-bar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. This surprising postulate correctly predicted the energy levels and spectrum of the hydrogen atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

The underlying reason for this quantization was later provided by Louis de Broglie in his PhD work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. If light could be both a wave and a particle, he reasoned, then matter particles like electrons must also be waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. De Broglie proposed that everything has a wavelength, inversely proportional to its momentum: λ = h/mv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>. For an electron to be stably bound in an atom, it must exist as a standing wave, meaning a whole number of wavelengths must fit around the circumference of its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. This condition precisely reproduced Bohr's quantized angular momentum, providing a physical reason for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>.

## Feynman's Path Integral Formulation: All Paths Explored

The wave nature of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum objects]] means they don't follow a single path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>. Instead, they "explore all possible paths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>. This concept is most vividly illustrated by the double-slit experiment. If an electron is fired through two slits, [[quantum_mechanics_and_deterministic_universe | quantum mechanics]] states it must go through both simultaneously since its path cannot be definitively determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. The probability of finding it on a screen is determined by adding the amplitudes of the waves from each slit and squaring the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.

Richard [[manyworlds_interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics | Feynman]], (in a story that illustrates the concept, if not historically accurate) extended this logic: if you add more slits, you add more amplitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>. If you have an infinite number of slits, and then an infinite number of screens with infinite slits, it implies that even in empty space, particles explore *all* possible paths to get from one point to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. This includes paths that go faster than light, back in time, or to the other side of the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

Feynman's path integral formulation of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]] suggests that anything moving between two points has a chance to take any path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>. Each path is assigned an amplitude, represented as a rotating vector ("stopwatch") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>. The "stopwatch" measures the phase of the wave, which changes as the particle moves along a path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>.

Crucially, the change in phase for a path is directly proportional to the classical action of that path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>. Planck's constant (h-bar, h/2π) is fundamental here:

```
Total Phase Change = (Total Action) / h-bar
```
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>

Since h-bar is incredibly tiny (approximately 10⁻³⁴ joule-seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:00">[23:43:00]</a>, the action of everyday objects on ordinary paths is enormous compared to h-bar. This means the phase "spins around zillions of times" for most paths, causing their amplitudes to point in random directions and destructively interfere when summed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.

The only paths that constructively interfere are those extremely close to the path of "least action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:35:00">[24:35:00]</a>. This is because for paths near the minimum action, tiny changes in the path result in negligible changes to the action (and thus phase), so their arrows point in similar directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>. This is why we observe classical trajectories; they are the result of constructive interference of countless quantum paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:00">[25:03:00]</a>.

### Demonstrating the Reality of All Paths

A demonstration using a diffraction grating provides compelling evidence that light explores all paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>. Normally, light reflects off a mirror at a specific angle (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:00">[26:55:00]</a>. If the spot of normal reflection is covered, the light seemingly disappears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a>. However, if a mirror is covered in many tiny strips (a diffraction grating), which selectively block or allow certain path phases, light can be made to reflect in "crazy paths" that would normally destructively interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a>. This effect demonstrates that these "crazy paths" are always being explored by light; it's simply that their contributions usually cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: Action as the Foundation of Physics

This understanding reveals how [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | classical mechanics]] emerges from [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:00">[25:24:00]</a>. Massive particles, having large actions relative to h-bar, experience very strong destructive interference for all but the paths closest to the [[principle_of_least_action_in_quantum_mechanics | path of least action]], making them appear very particle-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>. Smaller particles, like electrons or photons, have smaller actions, leading to a wider spread of possible trajectories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>.

For theoretical physicists, action and the [[principle_of_least_action_in_quantum_mechanics | principle of least action]] are more fundamental than energy or forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>. By defining the correct Lagrangian (which leads to the action) for a system, the laws of physics emerge directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:00">[32:09:00]</a>. The "hunt for the theory of everything" is essentially the search for a single Lagrangian that can encompass all known laws of physics in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:34:00">[32:34:00]</a>.

## The Problem: Unsafe Refrigerants
In 1929, Chicago experienced a mysterious series of deaths in homes, totaling 15 fatalities before authorities realized the cause was leaking refrigerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Early refrigerators relied on chemical refrigerants like methyl chloride, which was toxic and virtually odorless, leading to silent deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Other refrigerants were flammable, posing a fire risk if leaks occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Accidental Discovery
Seeking a safer alternative, the chemical company [[DuPont and chemical contamination coverup|DuPont]] initiated a project in 1936 to find a non-toxic, non-flammable gas for fridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Their lead scientist, 27-year-old chemist Roy J. Plunkett, was experimenting with tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), a gas with a pair of double-bonded carbons, each bonded to two fluorine atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

One morning, Plunkett's assistant found that a cylinder supposedly full of TFE was empty of gas, but still weighed as much as a full one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Plunkett cut the cylinder in half and discovered it was filled with a white, slippery powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. He deduced that under the cylinder's high pressure, the double bonds in TFE molecules broke, causing them to polymerize into long chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This new substance was polytetrafluoroethylene, or PTFE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Remarkable Properties
Initially, Plunkett wanted to discard the powder, as it had ruined his experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, he decided to test its properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. He found that water, acid, and even the strongest bases and solvents in the lab had no effect on it; it wouldn't melt, corrode, or react with anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. It appeared "seemingly indestructible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

This extreme inertness is due to the carbon-fluorine bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Fluorine is the most "electron-hungry" atom, and its small size allows its nucleus to strongly pull on other atoms' electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This creates a very strong bond with carbon, making it the strongest single bond a carbon atom can form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Since Plunkett's powder was covered in these bonds, it resisted nearly all chemical interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Early Applications
[[DuPont and chemical contamination coverup|DuPont]] initially didn't know what to do with such an inert material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. However, their involvement with the U.S. Army on the Manhattan Project provided an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. To produce enriched uranium for nuclear bombs, uranium had to be converted into uranium hexafluoride gas, a highly corrosive chemical that damaged plant equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

[[DuPont and chemical contamination coverup|DuPont]] realized that the indestructible PTFE could resist uranium hexafluoride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. They pressed the powder into "cakes" that could be machined into gaskets, seals, and pipe linings for the Oak Ridge plant, effectively solving the corrosion problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The material worked so well that the army wanted to use it for everything, including fuel tanks and airplane engines, and in plants making explosives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Branding and Production Challenges
Recognizing its potential, [[DuPont and chemical contamination coverup|DuPont]] trademarked the material in 1944 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. They combined "T-E" from tetra, "F-L" from fluoro, and "O-N" from other successful "miracle materials" like rayon and nylon, coining the name **Teflon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

[[DuPont and chemical contamination coverup|DuPont]] scaled up Teflon production at their Arlington, New Jersey, plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. However, the material's inertness made it difficult to work with, as it could only be molded into solids like gaskets, and it didn't dissolve in water, making it unsuitable for sprays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

A major challenge was the polymerization process itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Polymerizing TFE into Teflon is an exothermic reaction; if uncontrolled, it can rapidly heat up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Above 200 degrees Celsius, TFE decomposes, releasing even more energy and causing explosions, one of which killed two workers at the Arlington plant in 1944 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### The Role of PFOA (C8)
To dissipate heat and prevent explosions, the reaction needed to happen in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. However, TFE gas does not dissolve in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. To disperse TFE throughout the water, [[DuPont and chemical contamination coverup|DuPont]] acquired a special acid called PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid) from 3M in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

PFOA, also known as C8 due to its eight-carbon chain, was structurally similar to Teflon but had a water-loving (hydrophilic) acid head group and a water-repelling (hydrophobic) tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. When added to water, C8 molecules form tiny dry bubbles, similar to soap, that disperse the hydrophobic TFE gas throughout the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This allowed the polymerization reaction to occur evenly, dissipating heat and preventing explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

With Teflon now suspended in a solution, it could be sprayed as a coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. To make it stick to surfaces, the surface was sandblasted to create microscopic grooves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. When the coating was heated, the water and C8 evaporated, and the Teflon softened, mechanically adhering to the rough surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Commercial Success and Widespread Use
After World War II, the secrecy bans on Teflon patents were lifted, allowing [[DuPont and chemical contamination coverup|DuPont]] to sell it commercially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. A French engineer, Marc Gregoire, applied Teflon to his fishing gear in 1954, but his wife suggested applying it to a pan to make it non-stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

Non-stick pans, hitting the U.S. market in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, became a "cooking revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Teflon, C8, and similar chemicals were incorporated into a vast array of products, including stain-resistant carpets, stain protection sprays like 3M's Scotchgard, waterproof and breathable jackets (Gore-Tex), and medical implants that wouldn't be rejected by the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. It was even used to coat the Statue of Liberty's steel framework against corrosion and bullets to minimize gun barrel damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. By the late 1990s, the Teflon business generated roughly a billion dollars in yearly sales for [[DuPont and chemical contamination coverup|DuPont]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Growing Concerns and Cover-Up
While PTFE (Teflon coating) itself was considered safe because its long, inert molecules would be flushed out by the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, the processing aid, C8, raised concerns. Overheating Teflon to 350 degrees Celsius could release fumes causing "polymer fume fever" in workers, with mild, temporary symptoms, but much more toxic to birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

However, the real danger came from C8. As early as 1961, [[DuPont and chemical contamination coverup|DuPont]]'s in-house studies on rats showed that C8 caused abnormal liver growth and was lethal at higher doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Subsequent studies in 1962 and 1965 confirmed toxic effects in rats and dogs, affecting multiple organ systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. These studies were not shared with the scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

C8 was concerning because, like Teflon, its carbon-fluorine bonds made it incredibly stable and persistent in the environment for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Furthermore, C8 resembles fatty acids, allowing it to enter the bloodstream and accumulate in the body, potentially disrupting biological systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. It was described as "toxic, persistent, bioaccumulative... a ticking time bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

In 1975, independent researchers investigating fluoride in human blood discovered another type of fluorine—organic fluorine (carbon-fluorine bonds)—that was not naturally occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. They traced it to chemicals like PFOA made by 3M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. Despite 3M's initial denial, their own tests confirmed their chemicals were in the blood of people across the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. [[DuPont and chemical contamination coverup|DuPont]] and 3M also found their workers had C8 levels 1,000 times higher than the general population, with many showing signs of liver disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

This chemical, PFOA (C8), is part of a larger family of man-made chemicals known as PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which are widely known as "forever chemicals" due to their environmental persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. The widespread contamination and the associated health risks have led to significant legal actions and public awareness campaigns related to the [[Environmental impact of PFAS chemicals|environmental impact of PFAS chemicals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

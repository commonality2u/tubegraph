On August 21st, 2017, a total solar eclipse occurred, observed from Madras, Oregon, where the skies were clear for viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Preparation and [[photography_techniques_for_eclipses | Photography Techniques]]

To capture the event, a sky tracker was used. This device is designed to move the camera with the sky, compensating for the Earth's rotation, which helps keep the sun in frame as the eclipse progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Solar filters were also essential for the camera during observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Stages and [[effects_during_a_solar_eclipse | Effects During a Solar Eclipse]]

The experience unfolded through several distinct stages:

### First Contact (C1)
The moon's initial entry onto the top right side of the sun marked "first contact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Pre-Totality Changes
Approximately 17 minutes before totality, noticeable changes began:
*   The light started to dim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   A cold wind began to blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   The environment became cooler and darker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   When the sun was about 90 percent covered, shadows appeared much sharper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This phenomenon occurs because the light, normally diffused from many locations on the sun, now emanated from a single sliver, resulting in highly defined shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Totality
Inside totality, the visual and atmospheric effects were profound:
*   The sky appeared to have "sunset - sunrise" in every direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Prominences and the solar corona were visible, emerging from the top left and right at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   Venus was clearly visible directly above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   The phenomenon was described as resembling "a hole in the sky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Diamond Ring Effect
The "diamond ring effect" marked the end of totality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, signalling the sun's return and prompting the reapplication of solar filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## [[community_reactions_to_solar_eclipses | Community Reactions to Solar Eclipses]]

The event elicited strong emotional responses:
*   Initial excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   Exclamations of "Oh my God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, "insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, and "unbelievable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   The experience was described as "creepy" and "weird" due to the dramatic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Crowds reacted with excitement and cheering, especially as the diamond ring effect appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Many, including the observer, found themselves speechless and overwhelmed, stating they did not expect such an intense experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The visual appearance was described as "so wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> and "unreal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

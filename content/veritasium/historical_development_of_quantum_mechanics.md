The prevailing belief that every object follows a single, well-defined trajectory through space is, in fact, an illusion [00:00:06], [00:00:29]. Instead, everything is constantly exploring all possible paths simultaneously [00:00:17]. This fundamental concept is rooted in the historical development of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]], which emerged from unexpected observations and the re-evaluation of classical physics.

## Classical Precursors: The [[Principle of least action in quantum mechanics | Principle of Least Action]]

Prior to the advent of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]], the idea of optimal paths was already present in classical physics. A thought experiment involving a person trying to reach a friend in water illustrates this: the fastest path is not necessarily the shortest straight line, but rather one that balances faster running on land with slower swimming in water [00:00:22], [00:00:58]. This principle, where the optimal path depends on the speeds in different media, is identical to the law governing light refraction [00:01:08], [00:01:12]. Light also takes the fastest path between two points [00:01:16].

For a long time, physicists believed that light and objects simply followed local rules; if light encountered a new medium, it changed direction due to local interactions, and the observation that it took the shortest time was merely a consequence of these local rules, not an active optimization [00:01:45], [00:02:07].

This idea of an optimal path was formalized by Maupertuis, who, in an ad hoc proposal, suggested a quantity called "action" (defined as mass times velocity times distance), claiming that everything always follows the path that minimizes this action [00:02:40], [00:02:53]. Later, Hamilton showed that this action is equivalent to the integral over time of kinetic energy minus potential energy [00:02:59], [00:03:03]. This concept proved useful as an alternative method for solving physics problems, particularly when Newton's laws became too cumbersome [00:03:07]. However, it was not until the turn of the 20th century that "action" became central to a scientific revolution: the birth of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]] [00:03:15], [00:03:19].

## Birth of [[Quantum mechanics and wave function | Quantum Mechanics]]: Blackbody Radiation

The story of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]]' birth is intertwined with the practical problem of electric lighting in Germany in the 1890s [00:03:25], [00:03:28]. Scientists aimed to maximize the visible light emitted by hot filaments to replace gas street lights [00:03:39], [00:03:44].

At the German research institute, the PTR, scientists studied how different materials emitted light as a function of temperature [00:03:50], [00:03:54]. They observed that at low temperatures, each material emitted its own characteristic spectrum, mainly in the infrared. However, above approximately 500°C, all materials began to glow similarly, with an almost identical distribution of light. Hotter objects emitted more energy at every wavelength, and the peak of the distribution shifted towards shorter wavelengths [00:03:59], [00:04:08], [00:04:15].

To understand this phenomenon theoretically, they conceived of the "perfect blackbody" – a hypothetical object that absorbs all light falling on it and perfectly emits radiation based solely on its temperature [00:04:36], [00:04:40]. A hole in a metal cube served as this ideal model [00:04:47]. Within such a cavity, electrons in the walls wiggled, emitting electromagnetic waves [00:05:08]. These waves bounced off the walls, forming standing waves [00:05:11], [00:05:34]. For shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies), more vibrational modes could fit inside the cube, leading to the expectation that more waves would be present as the wavelength decreased [00:06:00], [00:06:16].

This expectation led to the Rayleigh-Jeans law, which accurately matched experimental data at longer wavelengths [00:06:22], [00:06:27]. However, at shorter wavelengths, the theory dramatically diverged, predicting an infinite amount of emitted energy. This became known as the **ultraviolet catastrophe** [00:06:30], [00:06:35], [00:06:42].

## Max Planck and Quantization

The problem was solved by Max Planck [00:06:49]. Despite being advised at 16 that physics was largely a complete science with only minor issues remaining, Planck persisted in his studies [00:06:53], [00:07:07], [00:07:11]. By 1897, as a professor himself, he dedicated three years to finding a theoretical explanation for blackbody radiation, trying numerous approaches without success [00:07:21], [00:07:26], [00:07:30].

In an "act of desperation," Planck made a radical departure from classical physics [00:07:44], [00:07:47]. Classical physics held that the energy of an electromagnetic wave depended only on its amplitude and could take any arbitrary value [00:07:50], [00:07:58]. Planck, however, restricted the energy so that it could only come in multiples of a smallest amount—a "quantum" [00:08:07], [00:08:10]. Crucially, he made the energy of one quantum directly proportional to its frequency: E = hf, where 'h' is a constant [00:08:15], [00:08:21]. This constant is now known as [[Plancks constant and its role in quantum mechanics | Planck's constant]] [00:10:27].

This quantization explained the blackbody spectrum: for low-frequency radiation, the quantum energy (hf) was small, so most atoms had enough energy to emit it, matching the Rayleigh-Jeans prediction. But for shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies, the quantum energy increased, meaning fewer atoms had enough energy to emit that wavelength. This caused the spectrum to peak and then fall to zero, thus resolving the ultraviolet catastrophe [00:08:27], [00:08:55], [00:09:01], [00:09:10], [00:09:20].

Planck's formula perfectly matched experimental data once 'h' was tuned [00:09:28], [00:09:36]. Yet, he was deeply troubled by his own discovery, viewing it as a mere mathematical trick without a clear physical explanation [00:09:44], [00:09:47], [00:09:50]. He had introduced a new physical constant without reason and dedicated himself to finding its theoretical interpretation, eventually realizing that [[Plancks constant and its role in quantum mechanics | Planck's constant]] had the units of action; it was a "quantum of action" [00:10:03], [00:10:14], [00:10:27], [00:10:31], [00:10:35]. Planck later proposed that any change in nature would occur in whole multiples of this quantum of action [00:10:38], [00:10:42].

## Einstein, Bohr, and De Broglie: The Spread of Quantization

Initially, the quantum of action received little attention [00:11:01], [00:11:05]. However, in 1905, Albert Einstein, then a 26-year-old patent clerk, proposed that Planck's theory was not just a mathematical trick but implied that light itself came in discrete packets, or photons, each with energy HF [00:11:11], [00:11:17]. Einstein used this insight to explain the photoelectric effect—how light ejects electrons from metal only when its frequency is high enough, regardless of intensity [00:11:24], [00:11:27], [00:11:33].

Eight years later, Niels Bohr, grappling with the stability of atoms (why electrons don't spiral into the nucleus), applied the idea of quantization [00:11:44], [00:11:46], [00:11:53]. Bohr recognized that angular momentum (mass times velocity times radius) had the same units as action [00:12:10], [00:12:13], [00:12:17]. Without clear theoretical justification, he arbitrarily "discretized" the orbital angular momentum, suggesting that electrons could only exist in orbits where their angular momentum was a multiple of [[Plancks constant and its role in quantum mechanics | Planck's constant]] divided by 2π (now known as h-bar) [00:12:21], [00:12:25], [00:12:30], [00:12:34]. This "quantum condition" seemed to come out of nowhere [00:12:42], [00:12:44], but it allowed Bohr to accurately predict the energy levels of the hydrogen atom and explain its emission spectrum [00:12:50], [00:12:54], [00:13:03]. This successful but inexplicable "quantization" of a quantity with units of action proved compelling [00:13:06], [00:13:11].

The full understanding of this quantization emerged 11 years later with Louis de Broglie's PhD work [00:13:23], [00:13:26], [00:13:29]. De Broglie had the profound insight that if light could behave as both a wave and a particle, then matter particles might also be waves [00:13:31], [00:13:35]. He proposed that everything, from electrons to basketballs, possesses a wavelength, defined by [[Plancks constant and its role in quantum mechanics | Planck's constant]] divided by the particle's momentum (mass times velocity) [00:13:44], [00:13:52], [00:13:56].

If an electron is a wave, it could only remain bound in an atom by forming a standing wave [00:14:03], [00:14:07]. This required that a whole number of wavelengths fit around the circumference of the electron's orbit [00:14:12], [00:14:15]. By substituting de Broglie's wavelength into this condition (circumference = n * wavelength), it directly yielded Bohr's previously ad hoc quantized angular momentum condition (angular momentum = n * h-bar) [00:14:18], [00:14:23], [00:14:33], [00:14:46]. This provided a physical reason for quantization: electrons are waves that must form stable standing waves when bound in atoms due to constructive interference [00:14:51], [00:14:55], [00:15:00].

## Feynman's Path Integral Formulation

This wave nature of quantum objects means that they do not follow a single path through space; instead, they must explore all possible paths [00:15:07], [00:15:10], [00:15:13]. This concept is powerfully illustrated by the double-slit experiment [00:15:19]. When a particle, such as an electron, is fired through two slits, [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]] states that it goes through both slits simultaneously because its path cannot be definitively determined [00:15:49], [00:15:55], [00:15:58]. To calculate the probability of finding the particle at a certain point on a screen, one must add up the amplitudes of the wave passing through each slit and then square the result [00:16:02], [00:16:05].

A thought experiment, attributed to Richard Feynman (though the story is made up, the logic is flawless), extends this idea: If you add more slits, you add more amplitudes. If you add an infinite number of slits, and then multiple screens, each with infinite slits, the implication is that even when light or particles travel through empty space, they are exploring all possible paths, as the mathematical formulation requires adding amplitudes from all theoretical "slits" [00:16:18], [00:16:33], [00:16:54], [00:17:12], [00:17:22], [00:17:34], [00:17:38].

This means that any time a particle moves from one place to another, all possible paths, including those that go faster than light, back in time, or to the moon and back, must be considered [00:17:52], [00:17:54], [00:17:57], [00:18:00], [00:18:03], [00:18:05], [00:18:09]. Feynman's formulation of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]] suggests that anything moving from one place to another is connected in every conceivable way [00:18:34], [00:18:36].

### Why We See a Single Path

If all paths are explored, why do we observe objects following a single, well-defined trajectory? The answer lies in how the amplitudes of these paths add up [00:20:26], [00:20:29]. Each path has an associated "amplitude" that can be visualized as an arrow, whose direction is determined by something called "phase" [00:20:48], [00:20:57], [00:21:34], [00:21:38]. As a particle's wave follows a path, its phase increases, causing the arrow to wind around [00:22:01], [00:22:05].

The crucial connection is that the change in phase for each path is determined by the classical action of that path [00:23:26], [00:23:27], [00:23:31], [00:23:33]. As a particle moves, its action increases, which in turn increases its phase [00:23:36], [00:23:38].

[[Plancks constant and its role in quantum mechanics | Planck's constant]] (h-bar) is incredibly tiny, roughly 10^-34 joule seconds [00:23:43], [00:23:46]. This is vastly smaller than the action of any everyday object [00:23:50]. Consequently, for ordinary objects following ordinary paths, the phase spins around zillions of times, resulting in a random direction for the amplitude arrow [00:23:54], [00:23:58], [00:24:01]. Even a tiny difference in action (e.g., 0.01 joule seconds) for a slightly different path will cause the arrow to spin an additional 10^32 times, again pointing in a random direction [00:24:05], [00:24:07], [00:24:13], [00:24:17].

This leads to a phenomenon called destructive interference [00:24:25], [00:24:29], [00:24:32]. For almost all possible paths, when their phases are added up, they cancel each other out [00:24:29], [00:24:32]. The only exception is for paths extremely close to the path of least action [00:24:35], [00:24:38]. Because these paths are at a minimum of action, tiny changes to the path result in negligible changes in action [00:24:42], [00:24:46]. Therefore, the amplitude arrows for these paths point in nearly the same direction, leading to constructive interference [00:24:50], [00:24:53], [00:24:57]. These are the paths we observe [00:24:59], [00:25:03].

This explains how classical mechanics emerges from [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_function | quantum mechanics]] [00:25:24], [00:25:28]. Objects like balls and planets don't have a precise trajectory; rather, they explore all possible paths. However, because massive particles have very large actions compared to [[Plancks constant and its role in quantum mechanics | Planck's constant]], only paths incredibly close to the true path of least action survive, making them appear "particle-like" and follow a classical trajectory [00:25:33], [00:25:36], [00:25:40], [00:25:44], [00:25:49]. For smaller particles like electrons or photons, actions are much smaller, leading to a greater spread in the trajectories they take, showcasing their wave-like behavior [00:25:51], [00:25:55], [00:25:58].

## Implications for Modern Physics

This understanding, developed by Feynman, radically shifted how physicists approach problems. The concept of action and the [[Principle of least action in quantum mechanics | principle of least action]] are now considered fundamental [00:31:30], [00:31:33], [00:31:36]. Modern theoretical physicists rarely discuss energy or forces directly, instead focusing on action [00:31:40], [00:31:42], [00:31:45]. This is because the correct "Lagrangian" (which defines the action) can generate all the laws of physics [00:32:09], [00:32:12], [00:32:16].

The search for a "theory of everything" in physics is fundamentally the hunt for this single, correct Lagrangian that can encapsulate all the known laws of the universe [00:32:34], [00:32:36], [00:32:38], [00:32:41], [00:32:45]. While partial Lagrangians exist for classical mechanics, special relativity, and electrodynamics, a unified mathematical structure that explains all physics remains an ongoing quest [00:32:17], [00:32:21], [00:32:25], [00:32:47], [00:32:52], [00:32:55].

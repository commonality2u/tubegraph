The Navy's Indoor Ocean at Carderock is the world's largest wave pool, designed to test scale models of ships and refine their [[ship_design_and_innovations | designs]] before they are deployed in the open ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The facility is immense, described as an "indoor ocean" due to its sheer size and the ocean-like appearance of its water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Facility Dimensions and Features
The indoor ocean measures 360 feet long in one dimension and 240 feet long in another, with a depth of 20 feet, roughly the size of a football field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The dome covering the facility was once the largest free-standing dome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Advanced Wave Generation
The pool features 216 individual wavemakers lining two of its walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These paddles are meticulously programmed to move in choreographed ways, producing reproducible waves of precise size and frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The angular motion of the paddles is achieved using air bellows, and force transducers measure the forces involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

A key differentiator of this facility is its precise control over wave creation, allowing for specific amplitudes and frequencies to be generated repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Wave Characteristics and Phenomena
Waves transmit energy, not material, from one place to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Water molecules in a wave generally move in circular paths, with the motion decreasing with depth until it stops at the wave base, which is half the wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. However, molecules do drift slightly in the direction of wave motion because they travel faster at the top of their loop than at the bottom, creating a spiral path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The facility enables observation of various wave properties:
*   **Frequency and Speed**: Higher frequency waves, despite having the same amplitude, appear to have a greater amplitude due to steeper slopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. High frequency waves travel slower than low frequency waves; wave speed is inversely proportional to its frequency when the water is deeper than the wave base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Breaking Waves**: By sending out high frequency waves followed by lower frequency waves, and taking advantage of their different speeds, engineers can time it so all waves meet at one point, causing them to break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Superposition**: When waves meet, their heights add together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This principle allows for the creation of large breaking waves from smaller individual waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Standing Waves**: By sending two regular waves towards each other, the facility can create standing waves where some areas have zero amplitude and others have maximum amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Bullseye Wave**: Waves can be sent from all directions to form circular wave fronts that channel all energy into one spot, known as the "bullseye," causing a powerful breaking wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Scale Model Testing for Ship Design
The primary purpose of the facility is to replicate real-world wave conditions on a small scale to test models of Navy ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This allows engineers to observe how different [[ship_design_and_innovations | designs]] behave in simulated conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

For accurate representation, several factors are considered:
*   **Water Type**: The pool uses fresh water, so ship models must be ballasted to account for the buoyancy difference compared to salty ocean water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Froude Number Scaling**: To achieve the correct wave dynamics, scaling is based on the Froude number, which measures the ratio of inertial to gravitational forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. If a model ship's hull is 46 times smaller than the real ship, it must travel at one over the square root of 46 times its real-world speed to yield accurate data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Footage from the model is then slowed down by the square root of 46 (roughly 6.8 times) to match the appearance of a full-size ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Tests involve both free-running models on a "race track" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a> and tethered models that are connected to a moving carriage for power and instrumentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Sensors, including ultrasonic sensors, are used to measure wave height, period, and direction to ensure test conditions match expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

## Replicating [[ocean_and_wave_conditions_in_different_regions | Ocean and Wave Conditions in Different Regions]]
The facility can simulate various wave conditions found globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Most ocean waves originate from wind, especially in and around storms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Five factors influence wave size and shape:
1.  Wind speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>
2.  Wind duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>
3.  Fetch (distance over which wind acts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>
4.  Width of the fetch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>
5.  Water depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>

### Types of Ocean Waves
*   **Swell**: As waves travel away from a storm, higher frequency waves dissipate their energy quicker. Thus, fast-moving low-frequency waves, known as swell, travel long distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Swell is not a significant concern for ships in the open ocean due to its long wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Rogue Waves**: These are typically not "out of nowhere" waves but rather multiple waves meeting and combining their amplitudes to create a much larger wave that then breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Wind Waves**: Formed in three steps:
    1.  Wind turbulence creates tiny ripples on still water surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
    2.  Wind acts on these ripples, increasing pressure differences and pulling them into larger waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
    3.  Continued wind interaction creates even larger waves, which then interact with each other to form a range of wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. As wind persists, waves break, dissipating kinetic energy as heat. The waves reach their maximum size when energy dissipation matches wind energy input, creating a "fully developed sea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

Different oceans have unique mixtures of wave frequencies, or "spectra," influenced by geography and storm types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>:
*   **North Sea**: Features a "peakier spectrum" due to limited fetch of storms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Mid-Atlantic**: Has a broader spectrum, describing developing or decaying open ocean waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **North Atlantic**: Exhibits the broadest spectrum of wind waves due to steady winds across an open ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

Before testing, engineers determine the ship's deployment location and select the appropriate wave spectra to simulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This allows for testing critical factors like water washing onto the deck, which is crucial for helicopter landing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

## Continuous Innovation in Ship Design
The facility plays a crucial role in validating [[ship_design_and_innovations | innovations]] before full-scale construction, significantly cutting costs and ensuring functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Every ship in the U.S. Navy's fleet has undergone testing or review at this facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

One example of design considerations is the "tumble home" hull shape, which curves inward from the waterline, as opposed to a traditional flared hull. While a flared hull provides restoring force when rolling, a tumble home design has less restoring force but offers benefits for "above water signatures" related to radar sections, aiming for stealthier, faster, and more powerful vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

The work done at the Navy's Indoor Ocean profoundly impacts the design and safety of every ship and submarine in the fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

Relativity Space, a startup, aims to [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D print an entire rocket]], including fuel tanks and engines, in just 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Their approach represents a significant shift from traditional aerospace manufacturing methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29">[03:29]</a>.

### The 3D Printing Process

Relativity Space utilizes the world's largest 3D metal printer, named "Stargate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45">[01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20">[14:20]</a>. This printer uses a wire-melt team and a print head that moves around, employing plasma discharge and changing electric waveforms every few milliseconds to control material deposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03">[01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14">[01:14]</a>. The raw metal is an aluminum alloy on a wire spool, printed at about 10 inches per second, with lasers and plasma arc discharge melting them together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38">[01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47">[01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51">[01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58">[01:58]</a>. The melting point of aluminum is 660 degrees Celsius, and the process occurs a few hundred degrees above that, effectively melting the entire rocket body together bit by bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22">[01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27">[01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30">[01:30]</a>.

Smaller, more complex parts like rocket engine injectors and nozzles are typically [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printed]] using metal powder and lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34">[09:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37">[09:37]</a>. This involves laying down fine layers of powder, about a twentieth the thickness of a human hair, repeatedly over days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45">[09:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49">[09:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52">[09:52]</a>.

### Challenges in 3D Printing Rockets

Despite the promise of [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]], early experiences with the technology can be frustrating, often resulting in unsatisfactory outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32">[02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37">[02:37]</a>. Relativity Space also encountered initial difficulties, producing "a pile of metal" that didn't work in their first couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42">[02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45">[02:45]</a>. Specific [[space_exploration_challenges | challenges]] in [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing rockets]] include:
*   **Warping and Material Integrity** If a 3D file were simply printed, the material could warp and fall, failing to form the intended structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30">[05:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35">[05:35]</a>.
*   **Surface Roughness** Early [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printed]] parts may still show visible layers, potentially raising concerns about aerodynamic performance or mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">[04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56">[04:56]</a>.
*   **Extreme Temperatures** Rocket combustion chambers can reach up to 3,500 Kelvin, hot enough to melt virtually any metal, posing a challenge for structural integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20">[08:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24">[08:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27">[08:27]</a>.
*   **Skepticism about Material Strength** There can be doubts about whether [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printed]] metals are strong enough for aerospace applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09">[10:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11">[10:11]</a>.
*   **Rocket Thinness** Rocket tanks are incredibly thin relative to their diameter, even thinner than a Coke can, requiring extreme rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15">[07:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18">[07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23">[07:23]</a>.

### Solutions and Innovations

Relativity Space has developed several solutions to overcome these [[space_exploration_challenges | challenges]], leading to significant [[advantages_of_3d_printed_rockets | advantages of 3D printed rockets]] over [[comparison_of_traditional_vs_3d_printed_aerospace_manufacturing | traditional manufacturing]]:
*   **Software-Driven Manufacturing** The company invented software that "reverse warps" the entire part before printing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40">[05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42">[05:42]</a>. This means the robots print a wobbly shape that cools to a perfectly straight form, accurate to within a human hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45">[05:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47">[05:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49">[05:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57">[05:57]</a>. All print simulations are done using a large computational solver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00">[06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02">[06:02]</a>.
*   **Post-Printing Machining** While visible layers may remain on the surface, some sections of the rocket, particularly joint sections, are machined after printing to achieve a normal metal appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59">[04:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11">[05:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14">[05:14]</a>. Surface roughness has been found to cause no aerodynamic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19">[05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22">[05:22]</a>.
*   **Internal Stiffeners** To prevent buckling and crumpling in the thin rocket tanks, stiffeners (internal rings) are printed directly into the structure, working in conjunction with internal pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41">[06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43">[06:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02">[07:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05">[07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10">[07:10]</a>.
*   **Custom Alloys** Relativity Space develops its own custom alloys specifically for [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]], resulting in printed materials that are counterintuitively stronger than traditionally built ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15">[10:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17">[10:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21">[10:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24">[10:24]</a>. This strength is achieved by taking advantage of the rapid melting and solidification physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28">[10:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33">[10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35">[10:35]</a>.
*   **Integrated Cooling Channels** For components exposed to extreme heat, such as combustion chambers and nozzles, cooling channels are printed directly into the single part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20">[09:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26">[09:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28">[09:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31">[09:31]</a>. This eliminates the need for thousands of small, brazed-welded pipes used in traditional designs like the Space Shuttle main engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54">[08:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09">[09:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16">[09:16]</a>.
*   **Rapid Iteration and Design Flexibility** [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]] allows for rapid iteration, enabling quick building, testing, and redesign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41">[10:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43">[10:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45">[10:45]</a>. Without fixed tooling, part geometries are controlled via the CAD model, allowing designs to be changed extremely fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07">[11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08">[11:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11">[11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16">[11:16]</a>. An entire engine can be built in about a month, allowing for continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19">[11:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22">[11:22]</a>.
*   **Reduced Part Count and Automation** A fully [[3d_printed_rockets | 3D printed rocket]] has a hundred times fewer parts than traditionally built rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37">[13:37]</a>. [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]] inherently provides automation for aerospace, as parts are "assembled" in the 3D file and then printed as an integrated unit, unlike traditional aerospace factories that still largely rely on hand assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41">[13:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41">[14:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04">[15:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41">[15:41]</a>.
*   **Complex Geometries** [[3d_printing_technology_in_rocket_manufacturing | 3D printing]] enables engineers to build parts that would be impractical or impossible with traditional techniques, allowing for complex, bio-inspired designs that are structurally optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54">[11:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56">[11:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58">[00:11:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00">[00:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03">[00:12:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31">[12:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35">[12:35]</a>.

### [[future_implications_of_3d_printed_rockets_on_space_exploration | Future Implications]]

Relativity Space's initial rocket, Terran One, focuses on low-earth orbit, but the larger Terran R is designed to send payloads to the Moon and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01">[16:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03">[16:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05">[16:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07">[16:07]</a>. The long-term vision is to shrink their "factory of the future" to launch to Mars and build an industrial base there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16">[16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19">[16:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21">[16:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23">[16:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26">[16:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28">[16:28]</a>. This approach aims to lower launch costs significantly, potentially making space access five to a hundred times cheaper with fully reusable rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31">[17:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33">[17:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34">[17:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38">[17:38]</a>. The ultimate goal for some involved is to expand human experience by enabling life on other planets, fostering new cultures and societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50">[17:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52">[17:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55">[17:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05">[18:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07">[18:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10">[18:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12">[18:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16">[18:16]</a>.

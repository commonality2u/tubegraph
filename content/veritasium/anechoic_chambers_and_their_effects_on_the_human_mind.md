Anechoic chambers are specialized rooms designed to eliminate echoes and external sound. The quietest place on Earth is reportedly an anechoic chamber in Minneapolis, while other facilities, like the one at BYU, also exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The term "anechoic" comes from Latin, meaning "no echo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Construction and Sound Absorption

The echo-free environment in an anechoic chamber is achieved through specific design elements:
*   **Foam Wedges** The walls and even the floor are covered with foam wedges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Spring Floor** The floor itself is a spring floor with wedges underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

These structures work by interacting with sound waves:
*   **Low Frequencies** Low frequency sound bounces within the shape of the wedges until it dissipates and is lost in the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **High Frequencies** High frequencies are primarily absorbed directly into the foam material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
The effectiveness of these rooms in deadening echoes can be heard by comparing the sound of clapping inside and outside the chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Reported [[psychological_responses_to_extreme_silence | Psychological Responses to Extreme Silence]]

Anechoic chambers are often associated with various claims about their effects on human perception and sanity. It is reported that it is impossible to stay sane for a significant period in these rooms, with a record purportedly being 45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Commonly reported effects include:
*   **Claustrophobia and Pressure** Individuals may feel claustrophobic or perceive a sense of pressure on their head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This is theorized to occur because the lack of sound reverberation, which normally signals space, makes the brain perceive the environment as tiny, akin to a coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Anxiety and Panic** The absence of ambient sounds, to which people are accustomed, can lead to panic and increased anxiety, potentially causing stress and contributing to perceptions of "going crazy" or hearing hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Disorientation and Nausea** Some reports suggest it becomes impossible to stand up due to disorientation, dizziness, and nausea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Visitors are often warned about potential dizziness before entering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Oral Hallucinations** Some individuals claim to experience oral hallucinations within the chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. A violinist, for example, reportedly tried to exit within seconds of being placed in such a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## [[physical_sensations_and_perceptions_in_silence | Physical Sensations and Perceptions in Silence]]

In the extreme silence of an anechoic chamber, the body's internal sounds become dramatically amplified:
*   **Clothing and Fluids** Initially, one hears the rustle of clothing and the movement of fluids in the mouth or throat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Blood Flow** The longer one stays, the more distinct internal sounds become. People begin to hear the blood flowing through their brain, described as a ringing or pulsing sound, like "shh, shh, shh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Heartbeat** Some report hearing their heartbeat coming from their chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The brain seems to recalibrate, amplifying even small sounds, making quiet things seem much louder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Personal Experience: Testing the Myth

A speaker undertook an experiment to test the claims about anechoic chambers, staying in one with the lights off for nearly an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

During the experience, he noted:
*   **Initial Comfort** He felt quite comfortable and found the quiet relaxing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Internal Sounds** He became acutely aware of his body's internal sounds, feeling his heart pulse radiating up his chest and head like a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. He also heard a hiss in his ears, which he attributed to hearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Physical Sensations** He felt his body shake slightly with each heartbeat, comparing it to a device with a small motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **No Hallucinations** Despite the profound silence and amplified internal sensations, he experienced no hallucinations or "craziness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

He successfully stayed for nearly an hour, concluding that the myth of going crazy or being unable to stay longer than 45 minutes is [[debunking_myths_about_silence_driving_people_crazy | debunked]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. He found the experience relaxing and conducive to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker's experience suggests that while the anechoic chamber significantly amplifies internal body sounds and can feel unusual, it does not necessarily cause insanity or hallucinations for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The perceived discomfort or "unnerving" nature of the experience might be more pronounced for individuals already uncomfortable in pitch-black or small, confined spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The room is not "pure silence" as the body's own internal sounds fill the void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

The creation and deployment of nuclear weapons, particularly the [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic bomb]], led to profound ethical considerations and a lasting impact on global politics and society. J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientific director of the Manhattan Project, became a central figure in these discussions due to his leadership role and his subsequent advocacy for arms control.

## Initial Concerns and Fears

Before the [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Trinity]] test, serious scientists were concerned about the atomic explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> setting fire to the atmosphere and ending all life on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Around 1942, Oppenheimer discussed with Arthur Compton the "terrible possibility" that a nuclear test could "end the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. The worry was that the high temperatures could initiate fusion of hydrogen gas, leading to a runaway reaction involving the Earth's atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. Compton also recalled Oppenheimer's fear that nitrogen in the air, being unstable, might also be set off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. While most scientists quickly realized the unlikelihood of this scenario, the thought persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

## The Trinity Test and Its Aftermath

The successful [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Trinity]] test on July 16, 1945, proved the viability of the [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic bomb]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. The blast, equivalent to nearly 25,000 tons of TNT, illuminated the New Mexico mountains brighter than daytime, with a shockwave felt over 160 kilometers away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Fortunately, it did not set fire to the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

Reflecting on the moments after the [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Trinity]] test in 1965, Oppenheimer famously quoted from the Bhagavad Gita: "Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. He felt that the world would not be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

## Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

The [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic bomb]] "Little Boy" was dropped on [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Hiroshima]] on August 6, 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. Its blast, equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT, killed nearly 70,000 people immediately, with another 70,000 dying from burns and [[health_impacts_of_radiation_exposure | radiation poisoning]] in subsequent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. Three days later, an implosion-type bomb was dropped on [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Nagasaki]], killing an estimated 80,000 more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. More than 95% of the 225,000 people killed in these bombings were civilians, primarily women and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

## Oppenheimer's Post-War Stance and the Arms Race

After [[historical_context_of_world_war_ii_and_nuclear_arms_race | World War II]], Oppenheimer became a national hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. As chairman of the General Advisory Committee on nuclear weapons issues, he used his position to argue for [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cold_war_strategies | arms control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

When the Soviet Union tested its first [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic bomb]] in August 1949, the US military decided to develop a more powerful weapon: the hydrogen bomb, or "The Super" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. Oppenheimer opposed its [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | development]] on ethical grounds and out of concern that it would initiate an [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cold_war_strategies | arms race]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. Despite his opposition, the Truman administration proceeded, leading to the first hydrogen bomb test, "Ivy Mike," in 1952, with a yield 400 times more powerful than the [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Trinity]] test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. This escalation was precisely what Oppenheimer had feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

Oppenheimer's opposition to the hydrogen bomb and his calls to avert a [[nuclear_arms_race_and_cold_war_strategies | nuclear arms race]] ultimately led to his security clearance being suspended in December 1953, effectively putting him on trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. He was questioned about alleged ties to the Communist Party and accused of treason and espionage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

## Oppenheimer's Nuanced Perspective

Oppenheimer held a complex view on the [[development_of_the_atomic_bomb | atomic bomb]]'s use. He believed it was assumed at Los Alamos that the weapon would play a part if the war were not resolved by diplomatic means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. He also felt that the alternative, an invasion campaign, was "certainly much more terrible for everyone concerned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. However, he stated that [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Hiroshima]] was "far more costly in life and suffering inhumane than it needed to have been, to have been an effective argument for ending the war," acknowledging the ease of this assessment in hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.

In 1965, when asked about proposed talks to halt nuclear weapons proliferation, Oppenheimer responded that it "should have been done the day after [[radioactive_sites_hiroshima_trinity_chernobyl_and_fukushima | Trinity]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. He died on February 18, 1967, at age 62 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

## Broader Ethical Considerations

The narrative of nuclear weapons highlights how advances in science and technology give humans "tremendous power to make the world better or worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. Beyond nuclear war, human-caused climate change is presented as another serious threat, demonstrating the ongoing challenges of [[engineering_ethics_and_crisis_management | engineering ethics and crisis management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. Addressing such global issues often requires collective action and policy changes, in addition to individual efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.

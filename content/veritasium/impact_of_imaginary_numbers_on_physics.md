[[history_of_physics_and_mathematics | Mathematics]] initially developed to quantify the world, including measuring land, predicting planetary motions, and tracking commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, a problem considered "impossible" arose, requiring the separation of [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics | math]] from the real world, specifically by splitting algebra from geometry and inventing new numbers known as [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | imaginary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Ironically, these [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | imaginary numbers]] later became central to our best [[application_of_calculus_in_physics | physical]] theory of the universe, suggesting that abandoning [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics | math]]'s connection to reality could lead to the discovery of reality's true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Genesis: Solving the Cubic Equation

In 1494, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci's [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics | math]] teacher, published "Summa de Arithmetica," a comprehensive summary of all known [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics | mathematics]] in Renaissance Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This work included a section on the cubic equation (ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0), which had eluded a general solution for at least 4,000 years, with [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics | ancient civilization]]s like the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, and Persians failing to solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Pacioli concluded that a solution to the cubic equation was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Historically, [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics | mathematicians]] used geometry to derive solutions to equations, such as quadratics, visualizing terms like x² as literal squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This geometric approach also meant that [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | negative numbers]] were not recognized as solutions, as they didn't make sense in real-world contexts like lengths or areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This aversion led to multiple versions of quadratic and cubic equations to ensure coefficients were always positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Cardano, Bombelli, and the "Impossible" Case

The secret to solving the depressed cubic equation (without an x² term) was first discovered by Scipione del Ferro around 1510 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This secret was later passed to his student Antonio Fior, and independently rediscovered by Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia through extending the concept of "completing the square" into three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Tartaglia's method, when applied to a specific cubic equation like x³ = 15x + 4, unexpectedly yielded solutions containing the square roots of [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | negative numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

Gerolamo Cardano, a polymath who had obtained Tartaglia's method, discovered a way to transform any general cubic equation into a depressed cubic, thus making it solvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. While writing "Ars Magna," Cardano encountered these "square roots of negatives," which he initially dismissed as "as subtle as it is useless" because they implied geometrically impossible concepts like "negative area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

It was Rafael Bombelli, about 10 years later, who tackled this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Undeterred by the impossible geometry, Bombelli assumed that the terms involving square roots of negatives could be combined with "ordinary numbers" to form a new type of number involving the square root of negative one. By doing so, he showed that the square roots of negatives could cancel out, leading to a correct real solution for the cubic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. This was a "miraculous" discovery, demonstrating that Cardano's method worked, but only by abandoning the original geometric proof and accepting "negative areas" as an intermediate step to a real solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

## From Abstraction to Reality: Imaginary Numbers in Physics

The cubic equation directly led to the invention of these new [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | numbers]] and liberated algebra from geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. Over the next century, [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics | modern mathematics]] developed, with Francois Viete introducing modern symbolic notation for algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Rene Descartes popularized the use of square roots of negatives, calling them "[[history_of_imaginary_numbers | imaginary numbers]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>, and Euler later introduced 'i' to represent the square root of negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

### The Schrödinger Equation

In 1925, Erwin Schrödinger, building on de Broglie's work, sought a [[application_of_calculus_in_physics | wave equation]] to govern the behavior of [[application_of_calculus_in_physics | quantum particles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. He formulated the [[application_of_calculus_in_physics | Schrödinger equation]], one of the most significant equations in all of [[application_of_calculus_in_physics | physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Prominently featured within this equation is 'i', the square root of negative one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. This surprised physicists, as they were uncomfortable seeing [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | imaginary numbers]] in such a fundamental theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Schrödinger himself questioned its use, believing the wave function should be a real function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

The inclusion of 'i' in the [[application_of_calculus_in_physics | Schrödinger equation]] stems from the unique properties of [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | imaginary numbers]]:
*   **Rotation in the Complex Plane**: [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | Imaginary numbers]] exist on a dimension perpendicular to the real number line, forming the complex plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. Multiplying by 'i' repeatedly rotates a point by 90 degrees in this plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.
*   **Connection to Waves**: The function `e^(ix)` (Euler's formula) creates a spiral that spreads out these rotations along the X-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. The real part of this spiral is a cosine wave, and the [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | imaginary]] part is a sine wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. Both cosine and sine waves are quintessential functions for describing waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.
*   **Mathematical Utility**: Schrödinger naturally assumed solutions to his [[application_of_calculus_in_physics | wave equation]] would look like `e^(ikx - ωt)`. The exponential form offers useful properties, such as its derivative with respect to position or time being proportional to the original function itself, unlike sine functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Additionally, the linearity of the [[application_of_calculus_in_physics | Schrödinger equation]] allows for adding arbitrary numbers of these exponential solutions to create any wave shape, which will also be a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

Physicist Freeman Dyson highlighted that "Schrödinger put the square root of minus one into the equation, and suddenly it made sense. Suddenly it became a [[application_of_calculus_in_physics | wave equation]] instead of a heat conduction equation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. The [[application_of_calculus_in_physics | Schrödinger equation]] correctly describes everything known about the behavior of atoms, forming the basis of chemistry and most of [[application_of_calculus_in_physics | physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. Its reliance on the square root of minus one implies that "nature works with complex numbers and not with real numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>, a discovery that was a complete surprise to Schrödinger and his contemporaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

Thus, [[history_of_imaginary_numbers | imaginary numbers]], initially conceived as a peculiar intermediate step in solving the cubic, proved to be fundamental to our description of reality in [[application_of_calculus_in_physics | fundamental physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. By letting go of a purely "real" mathematical connection to reality, [[history_of_physics_and_mathematics | mathematics]] was able to guide us to a deeper understanding of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.

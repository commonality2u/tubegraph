Jumping, whether biological or engineered, is defined by specific criteria and relies on efficient energy storage and release mechanisms. A tiny robot, weighing less than a tennis ball, currently holds the world record for jumping higher than anything previously recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While the previous record for jumping robots was 3.7 meters, enough to clear a single-story building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, this new robot can reach 31 meters, surpassing a 10-story building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, and could even jump from the Statue of Liberty's feet to eye level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Defining a Jump

For an action to be considered a jump, it must satisfy two main criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>:
1.  **Propulsion from the Ground** Motion must be created by pushing off the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This means quad-copters are not considered jumpers because they push off the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
2.  **No Mass Loss** No mass can be lost during the action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Therefore, rockets constantly ejecting burnt fuel are not jumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, and an arrow launched from a bow does not count unless the bow accompanies the arrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Biological Jumpers

Many animals, from sand fleas to grasshoppers and kangaroos, use a single stroke of their muscles to launch their bodies into the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The height of the jump is determined by the amount of energy delivered in that single stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. To jump higher, the muscle strength must be maximized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The Galago, or Bush Baby, is considered the best jumper in the animal kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This is because 30% of their entire muscle mass is dedicated to jumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This adaptation allows the squirrel-sized primate to jump over two meters from a standstill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. They have very small arms and upper bodies, with huge jumping legs, indicating that their superior jumping ability comes from having more muscle, not necessarily better muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Interestingly, while no organism has developed work multiplication for a jump from a standstill internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, biological organisms do utilize latches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. For example, the sand flea, known for its incredible jump height relative to its body size, uses a two-muscle system: a big power muscle and a trigger muscle that shifts the pivot point for a torque reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Externally, some animals exhibit similar principles; spider monkeys pull back branches hand over hand using multiple muscle strokes to catapult themselves forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, and slingshot spiders use a silky string, pulling it back multiple times to slingshot themselves to another location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Engineered Jumpers

All elastic jumpers, like the high-jumping robot, operate on the principle of storing energy in a spring and then releasing that energy in a single stroke to jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### [[applications_of_jumping_robots_in_space_exploration | Applications of Jumping Robots]]

Jumping is a niche skill, but engineered jumpers could be ideal for [[applications_of_jumping_robots_in_space_exploration | exploring other worlds]], especially those with thin or non-existent atmospheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. On the Moon, with one-sixth of Earth's gravity, this robot could leap 125 meters high and half a kilometer forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Jumpers could overcome challenges like steep cliffs and deep craters that confound rovers, by hopping in and out to fetch samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Jumping is also very energy-efficient; if the kinetic energy could be stored back in the spring upon landing, efficiency could be near perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

A fleet of jumping robots is already being developed, with some designed to right themselves after landing for immediate re-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Others are steerable, featuring three adjustable legs that allow the jumper to launch in any direction, forming a tripod to point and launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### [[design_and_mechanics_of_the_highest_jumping_robot | Design and Mechanics of the Highest Jumping Robot]]

The main structure of the record-breaking jumper consists of four carbon fiber pieces bound by elastic bands, forming a spring that stores all the jump energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. A small motor at the top winds a string connected to the bottom of the robot, compressing it and storing energy in the carbon fiber and rubber bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. After about 90 seconds, the structure reaches maximum compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. A trigger then releases a latch, unspooling the string and releasing the stored energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This propels the jumper from standstill to over 100 kilometers per hour in just nine milliseconds, resulting in an acceleration of over 300 g's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

The exceptional height achieved by this jumper is due to three special [[design_and_mechanics_of_the_highest_jumping_robot | design features]]:
1.  **Lightweight Construction** The jumper is incredibly light, weighing only 30 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This is achieved by using a tiny motor and battery, and an entire structure made of lightweight carbon fiber and rubber that doubles as the spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Natural latex rubber can store 7,000 joules per kilogram, more energy per unit mass than almost any other elastic material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
2.  **Optimized Spring Design** The spring's design is tailored for its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Initial attempts with only rubber bands connected to hinged aluminum rods resulted in a force profile that peaked and then decreased during compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Another design using only carbon fiber slats required a lot of initial force, then increased linearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The ultimate [[design_and_production_of_compliant_mechanisms | design]] is a hybrid of these two, providing an almost flat force profile over the entire compression range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This allows it to store double the energy of a typical spring where force is proportional to displacement, making it potentially the most efficient spring ever made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Adding a chunk of steel to the top of the jumper can actually make it jump higher, because the body (the part moving) should ideally weigh at least as much as the foot to ensure efficient energy transfer during collision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
3.  **Work Multiplication** Unlike animals that use a single muscle stroke, engineered jumpers can store energy from many strokes or motor revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This "time for energy" trade-off allows a small motor to gradually build up energy over minutes, rather than delivering it all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. A latch under tension prevents the spring from unspooling until the robot is fully compressed, enabling this energy accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## [[Comparison between biological and engineered jumpers | Comparison of Jumping Mechanisms]]

For years, engineered jumping aimed to mimic biological jumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. However, the introduction of work multiplication gave engineered jumpers a distinct advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. By building up energy over time with a motor, the motor's power is no longer the limiting factor; instead, the spring becomes the critical component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This allows researchers to focus on creating the most powerful spring possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

The current jumper has nearly maximized the achievable height with its current spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Theoretically, even with an infinitely light motor and infinite winding time, the maximum possible jump height with this compression spring is only about 19% higher than what has been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

To further increase jump height, factors like air resistance and aerodynamics can be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Making the jumper 10 times isometrically larger could lead to a 15-20% higher jump, as scaling up by ten times in all directions increases the cross-sectional area by a hundred (increasing drag force) but increases the mass by a thousand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This greater inertia means the drag force affects the larger jumper less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

The concept of work multiplication has the potential to elevate robots to the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. By allowing robots to gradually build up energy from multiple turns of a motor over time, they can store and release vast amounts of energy, leading to new world records in various applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

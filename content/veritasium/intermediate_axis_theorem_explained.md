## Alternative Names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
The phenomenon known as the **Intermediate Axis Theorem** is also referred to as the **Dzhanibekov effect** or the **tennis racket theorem** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Discovery: The Dzhanibekov Effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
### Cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
In 1985, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov was on a mission to save the completely shut-down Soviet space station Salyut 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This dramatic mission was even made into a Russian movie in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Observed Phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
After successfully rescuing the space station, Dzhanibekov was unpacking supplies secured by a wing-nut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. As the wing-nut spun off its bolt, he noticed a strange behavior: it maintained its orientation for a brief period, then flipped 180 degrees, and subsequently flipped back and forth at regular intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This motion occurred without any external forces or torques applied to the wing-nut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
This counterintuitive phenomenon was kept secret by the Russians for 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## The Tennis Racket Theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
Six years later, in 1991, a paper titled "The Twisting Tennis Racket" was published in the *Journal of Dynamics and Differential Equations* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. While related, it did not mention the secret Dzhanibekov effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The paper describes how a tennis racket, when flipped in the air, not only rotates as intended but also makes a half-turn around an axis through its handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Principal Axes of Rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
Any object can be spun about three principal axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>:
1.  **First Axis**: Runs through the handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
2.  **Second Axis**: Runs parallel to the head of the racket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
3.  **Third Axis**: Runs perpendicular to the head of the racket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Moment of Inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
The ease of spinning an object around an axis depends on its moment of inertia, which is related to how mass is distributed around that axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>:
*   **Smallest Moment of Inertia**: Achieved when spinning about the first axis (through the handle), because mass is distributed closest to this axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This allows for the fastest spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Greatest Moment of Inertia**: Achieved when spinning about the third axis (perpendicular to the head), because mass is distributed farthest from this axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:03:03]</a>. This results in a slower spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Intermediate Moment of Inertia**: Achieved when spinning about the second axis (parallel to the head) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Stable vs. Unstable Rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>
Rotation about the first (smallest moment of inertia) and third (greatest moment of inertia) axes is stable; no rotation occurs about other axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, rotation about the second, or intermediate, axis is unstable and results in the half-twist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Requirements for the Effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>
The intermediate axis effect requires an object to have three different moments of inertia about its three principal axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Objects like a spinning ring (two different moments of inertia) or anything with spherical symmetry (only one moment of inertia) will not demonstrate this theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. An object that exhibits this effect is called an "asymmetric top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Historical Context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
Despite claims in the 1991 tennis racket paper that the phenomenon seemed new and was not mentioned in general classical mechanics texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, it is actually present in textbooks like Landau and Lifschitz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Understanding of the intermediate axis theorem dates back at least 150 years to Louis Poinsot's book "The New Theory of Rotating Bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Intuitive Explanation by Terry Tao <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>
### Richard Feynman's Opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>
The renowned physicist Richard Feynman, when asked if there was an intuitive way to understand the intermediate axis theorem, reportedly pondered for 10-15 seconds before stating, "No" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Terry Tao's Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
An intuitive explanation was provided by Fields Medalist Terry Tao on Math Overflow in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. His explanation involves a thin, rigid, massless disc with heavy point masses on opposite edges of the x-axis and light point masses on opposite edges of the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   Rotating around the **x-axis** results in the **smallest moment of inertia** (only light masses move) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   Rotating around the **z-axis** results in the **greatest moment of inertia** (all four masses move) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   Rotating around the **y-axis** results in the **intermediate moment of inertia** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### The Role of Centrifugal Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
In a rotating frame of reference, centrifugal forces appear, pushing masses away from the rotation axis in proportion to their distance from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   If the disc rotates perfectly about the y-axis, the small masses on the y-axis experience no centrifugal force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. The centrifugal force on the big masses is balanced by centripetal forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### The Flipping Mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>
If the disc is bumped and no longer rotates perfectly about the y-axis:
1.  The small masses experience centrifugal force proportional to their distance from the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
2.  Tension within the disc keeps the small masses orthogonal to the big masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
3.  The large inertia of the big masses constrains the small masses to lie mostly in the y-z plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
4.  The centrifugal forces on the small masses accelerate them further from the y-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
5.  This acceleration continues until they flip to opposite sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
6.  In the second half of the flip, centrifugal forces slow the masses down, reversing the acceleration, bringing them to rest on the opposite side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
7.  This pattern repeats indefinitely, with the disc flipping back and forth at regular intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

## The "End of the World" Hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>
### Dzhanibekov's Experiment and Speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
After observing the wing-nut's behavior, Dzhanibekov attached a ball of modeling clay to it and found that it also flipped periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This led to speculation that the Earth, being a spinning ball in space, might also flip over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This idea gained traction among conspiracy theorists in 2012, fueled by Mayan prophecies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

### Official Russian Statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>
On May 13, 2012, the official site of the Russian federal space agency, RusCosmos, published an article for Dzhanibekov's 70th birthday stating, "the spinning nut of Dzhanibekov caused astonishment and simultaneous danger to a certain part of the scientific world. A hypothesis was proposed that our planet, in the course of its orbital motion, can execute the same overturn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Debunking the Hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
Experiments by astronaut Don Pettit aboard the space station help to assess this hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. A solid cylinder will spin stably about its first or third axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. However, a liquid-filled cylinder spinning about its first (smallest moment of inertia) axis becomes unstable and ends up rotating about its axis with the largest moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

#### Energy Dissipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>
While an isolated object's angular momentum remains constant, its kinetic energy can be converted into other forms, such as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. When a liquid sloshes inside a cylinder, energy is dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Spinning with the smallest moment of inertia means spinning with the greatest kinetic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. As this energy dissipates, the cylinder is forced to spin about the axis that achieves the minimum kinetic energy, which is the axis with the largest moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This means that for a given angular momentum, rotating with the maximum moment of inertia is the lowest energy state, towards which all bodies will tend if they can dissipate energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

#### Examples of Stable Rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>
##### Explorer One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
The US learned this principle the hard way with their first satellite, Explorer One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Designed to be spin-stabilized about its long axis, it began rotating end-over-end within hours of orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This was due to its flexible antennas, which allowed the satellite to dissipate energy as they swung back and forth, reducing its kinetic energy until it had to rotate by the axis that maximized its moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

##### Astronomical Objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>
Most astronomical objects, including Earth, dissipate energy internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   Mars, for example, has a major positive gravity anomaly called the Tharsis Rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. It is located at the equator, placing it as far as possible from the axis of rotation, ensuring Mars rotates with the maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   Most asteroids also spin around the axis with the maximum moment of inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

### Conclusion: Earth is Stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>
The Earth will not flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. It is already spinning about the axis with the maximum moment of inertia, which is a stable state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

On Wednesday, April 10th, 2019, the [[first_image_of_a_black_hole_by_event_horizon_telescope | Event Horizon Telescope]] released what was expected to be the first-ever image of a [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This image was anticipated to resemble a "fuzzy coffee mug stain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Significance of the Image

The importance of this image extends beyond its visual appearance. It is expected to provide crucial data to determine whether the [[general_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | General Theory of Relativity]] accurately predicts phenomena within the strong gravity regime that exists around a [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Anatomy of a Black Hole

To understand the image, it's essential to grasp the key components and regions surrounding a [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]]:

### Event Horizon
The [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | event horizon]] is a spherical boundary from which nothing, not even light fired directly away from the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], can be detected by an outside observer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. All world lines inside this boundary lead to the singularity at the center of the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]]; there is no return once inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The radius of the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | event horizon]] is known as the Schwarzschild radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

If a [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] existed in isolation, it would be impossible to image as it absorbs all electromagnetic radiation that falls onto it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Accretion Disk
The [[supermassive_black_hole_in_m87_and_its_properties | supermassive black hole]] being observed, Sagittarius A* at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, is surrounded by an [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This disk consists of dust and gas swirling chaotically at millions of degrees Celsius and moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This matter is what the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] consumes to grow over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] does not extend all the way to the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | event horizon]] due to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. For a non-spinning [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], this orbit is located at three Schwarzschild radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Matter entering this orbit quickly spirals into the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Photon Sphere
Light, having no mass, can orbit even closer to the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] than matter, at 1.5 Schwarzschild radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This region forms a sphere of photon orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Theoretically, if one could stand there, they could see the back of their own head due to light completing an orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. However, the photon sphere is an unstable orbit, meaning photons will eventually either spiral into the singularity or escape to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Relativistic Effects and Imaging
The [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | black hole's immense gravity warps space-time]], causing light rays to follow curved paths rather than straight lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | space-time curvature]] significantly influences what we observe in the image:

### The Black Hole Shadow
When observing the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], light rays coming in parallel from the observer can be warped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Even light rays just above the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | event horizon]] or at the distance of the photon sphere can be bent and eventually fall into the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

For a light ray to reach an observer without falling into the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], it must originate at a distance of 2.6 Schwarzschild radii away. At this distance, it will just graze the photon sphere at its closest approach before heading off to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The resulting "shadow" observed is therefore 2.6 times larger than the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

The center of this shadow directly maps to the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Furthermore, due to [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | space-time warping]], light rays that pass above or below the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] can allow us to see the entire backside of the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | event horizon]] mapped onto a ring within this shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Light can also go around the back and get absorbed in the front, creating multiple, even infinite, images of the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | event horizon]] as one approaches the edge of the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The first light we can see originates from rays that graze the photon sphere and then reach our telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Seeing the Back of the Accretion Disk
Even if we are looking edge-on to the [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]], the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]]'s [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | warped space-time]] bends light rays, allowing us to see the back side of the [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Light from the top of the disk can bend over the top of the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] and reach our telescopes, and similarly, light from the bottom can bend underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This bending effect is why images resemble the [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | black hole]] depicted in "Interstellar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

More complex paths are also possible; light from the top of the [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] can go around the back of the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]], graze the photon sphere, and appear as a thin ring underneath the shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Conversely, light from underneath the disk in the front can go underneath and around the back to appear over the top, forming a ring of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Relativistic Beaming
A crucial effect on the image is [[relativistic_beaming_and_plasma_orbiting_the_black_hole | relativistic beaming]], also known as Doppler beaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Since the matter in the [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] moves at speeds close to the speed of light, if it's moving towards the observer, it will appear significantly brighter than if it's moving away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This results in one side of the [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]] appearing much brighter, creating a bright spot in the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Future Observations
Scientists hope to observe how the [[concept_of_black_holes_and_their_properties | black hole]] image changes over time, specifically looking for "blobs" of matter moving around the [[accretion_disk_around_black_holes | accretion disk]], which would further validate the predictions of [[relativistic_effects_and_imaging_black_holes | relativistic effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

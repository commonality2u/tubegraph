[[Aerogel]] is known as the world's lightest, or least dense, solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A small piece can have a mass of just 1.22 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, which is only a few times the mass of the same volume of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This is because [[aerogel]] is 99.8% air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Some [[aerogel]]s are so light that if all the air were removed, they would be less dense than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Composition and Creation Process

The [[history_and_invention_of_aerogel|invention of aerogel]] dates back to 1931, when Professor Samuel Kistler made a bet with Charles Learned about removing liquid from a jelly without affecting its solid structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Jellies are combinations of liquids and solids, mostly liquid embedded within a 3D solid structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. A gel, like jello, has a skeleton with nano-sized pores that provide rigidity, making up about 1% of the gel's mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

The challenge was that if liquid is simply evaporated, the solid structure shrinks and crumbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Kistler solved this in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>:
1.  **Liquid Exchange**: One liquid can be replaced with another, such as swapping water for alcohol, by thoroughly washing the jelly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Supercritical Drying**: The gel is then placed in a high-pressure vessel called an autoclave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. By heating it to its critical point (high-temperature, high-pressure), the liquid transforms into a semi-liquid, semi-gas state known as a supercritical fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. At this point, there's no distinction between liquid and gas, and molecules no longer pull on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. When the vessel is depressurized, the solid skeleton, about 1% of the original gel's mass, remains intact, with gas filling the pores where liquid once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This nanoporous solid is [[aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Kistler published his findings in Nature in 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Kistler made [[aerogel]]s from various substances, including eggs, rubber, nitrocellulose, and silica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
A wet silica gel, for example, is rubbery and consists of 97% alcohol within its pores, with the remaining 3% being amorphous silica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. For modern production, the alcohol in the gel is often replaced with liquid carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚), which is non-flammable and has a low critical temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## [[properties_of_aerogel|Properties of Aerogel]]

### Physical Characteristics
*   **Appearance**: When viewed against a light background, [[aerogel]] is almost transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. However, against a darker background, it exhibits a slight bluish color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This blue hue is due to [[wave_physics_and_properties|Rayleigh scattering]], similar to why the sky is blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Its nanoscale structures scatter shorter wavelengths (like blue) much more intensely than longer wavelengths (yellow or red) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Consequently, [[aerogel]] appears opaque in the ultraviolet spectrum and transparent in the infrared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. When held up to a blue sky, [[aerogel]] appears yellow because it scatters out the blue light, allowing longer wavelengths like yellows and oranges to pass through, creating an effect similar to a portable sunset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Texture and Durability**: Original silica [[aerogel]] is not very strong and can be very crumbly and easy to break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. However, scientists are working on increasing its durability and elasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **[[hydrophobic_and_hydrophilic_characteristics_of_aerogel|Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Characteristics]]**: Original silica [[aerogel]] is hydrophilic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, meaning it absorbs water and can be ruined by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. However, methods exist to make it waterproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel|Thermal Insulation Capabilities]]

The nanoscale pores of [[aerogel]] are crucial to its effectiveness as a [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel|thermal insulator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Despite being largely comprised of air (99%), it is a better insulator than air itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This is due to the Knudsen effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>: the width of the pores is smaller than the mean free path of air molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This makes it difficult for hot, fast-moving air molecules to diffuse through the [[aerogel]] and transfer heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

For example, in an experiment demonstrating its insulating power, a Bunsen burner was applied to chocolate bunnies placed on a glass petri dish and an [[aerogel]] layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Glass**: The glass petri dish became very hot quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. After just one minute, the chocolate bunny started smoking and melting, eventually undergoing a phase change into a liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The petri dish also cracked due to thermal expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Aerogel**: Even after nearly three minutes, there was no sign of melted chocolate on the [[aerogel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. A thermocouple showed the flame temperature underneath the [[aerogel]] to be 600 degrees Celsius (1250 Fahrenheit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, while the top surface remained only warm to the touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The chocolate on top eventually softened and melted only where the flame crawled up and over the sides of the [[aerogel]], not directly through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

This extreme insulation makes [[aerogel]] useful in various [[applications_and_uses_of_aerogel|applications]], including [[uses_of_aerogel_in_space_exploration|space exploration]]. NASA has used [[aerogel]] insulation on Mars rovers like Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity, and plans to use it on future Mars missions to protect electronics from the cold Martian nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### Future [[development_and_future_applications_of_aerogel|Development]]

While [[aerogel]] has remarkable [[properties_of_aerogel|properties]], its high cost and brittleness have limited its widespread everyday use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Scientists are actively working on reducing manufacturing costs and increasing its durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The [[development_and_future_applications_of_aerogel|development of "next-generation aerogels"]] includes making them waterproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

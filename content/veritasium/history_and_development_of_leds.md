Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are electronic devices that produce light. Their color originates from the electronics within, not from their plastic covers, which primarily serve to differentiate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. [[the_science_behind_led_function | The color of the light comes from the electronics themselves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Early Development and Limitations

The first visible LED was created in 1962 by General Electric engineer Nick Holonyak, emitting a faint red glow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. A few years later, engineers at Monsanto developed a green LED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For decades, these two colors were the only ones available, limiting LED applications to indicators, calculators, and watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

The ability to create blue light was crucial, as mixing red, green, and blue light allows for the creation of white and every other color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This breakthrough would enable [[impact_of_blue_led_on_technology_and_industry | unlocking LEDs for every type of lighting]] worldwide, from [[history_of_the_light_bulb | light bulbs]] to phones, computers, TVs, and billboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, [[challenges_in_creating_blue_leds | blue was almost impossible to make]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Throughout the 1960s, major electronics companies like IBM, GE, and Bell Labs competed fiercely to develop the blue LED, recognizing its potential worth of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Despite the efforts of thousands of researchers, no viable solution emerged for decades, leading many to believe LEDs would never replace traditional lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. A director at Monsanto stated they would only be used in appliances, car dashboards, and stereo sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## The Science Behind LED Function

[[the_science_behind_led_function | The science behind LED function]] contrasts sharply with that of incandescent [[history_of_the_light_bulb | light bulbs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Incandescent bulbs generate light by heating a tungsten filament until it glows, but most of the emitted electromagnetic radiation is infrared heat, with only a negligible fraction being visible light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. In contrast, LED stands for "light-emitting diode," indicating its primary function is to create light, making them far more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. A diode is a two-electrode device that permits current flow in only one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Energy Bands and Semiconductors
In an isolated atom, electrons occupy discrete energy levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. When multiple atoms form a solid, their outermost electron energy levels shift, forming a series of closely spaced, but separate energy levels known as an "energy band" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

*   **Valence Band**: The highest energy band containing electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Conduction Band**: The next higher energy band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Band Gap**: The energy difference between the valence and conduction bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Materials are classified based on their band structure:
*   **Conductors**: Have a partially filled valence band, allowing electrons to easily move and conduct current with minimal thermal energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Insulators**: Have a full valence band and a large band gap, preventing electron movement and current flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Semiconductors**: Similar to insulators but with a much smaller band gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. At room temperature, some electrons gain enough energy to jump into the conduction band, allowing current flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The empty spaces left behind in the valence band are called "holes," which behave like positive charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Doping and P-N Junctions
To enhance functionality, impurity atoms are added to semiconductors, a process called "doping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **N-type semiconductors**: Doping with atoms like phosphorus (in silicon) adds extra valence electrons, creating a "donor level" just below the conduction band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. These electrons can easily jump into the conduction band, making electrons the primary mobile charge carriers (hence "n-type" for negative) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **P-type semiconductors**: Doping with atoms like boron (in silicon) creates an "acceptor level" just above the valence band, leading to a deficiency of valence electrons and thus forming holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. These positive holes are primarily responsible for carrying current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

When p-type and n-type semiconductors are joined, electrons diffuse from the n-side to the p-side, filling holes. This creates a "depletion region" at the junction, an area devoid of mobile charge carriers, and an internal electric field forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. When a battery is connected with correct polarity, the depletion region shrinks, allowing electrons to flow from the n-side to the p-side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Light Emission
When an electron falls from the conduction band into a hole in the valence band, the energy released (the band gap energy) is emitted as a photon of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The size of this band gap determines the color of the emitted light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. For instance, silicon's band gap is 1.1 electron volts, releasing infrared light, commonly used in remote controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Red and green LEDs require larger band gaps, while blue light demands even more energy and thus a larger band gap, explaining its historical difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Shūji Nakamura and the Blue LED Breakthrough

By the 1980s, despite significant investment and extensive research, no company had successfully created a blue LED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. A critical requirement was understood: a near-perfect crystal structure, as defects dissipate energy as heat instead of visible light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

Shūji Nakamura, a researcher at the small Japanese chemical company Nichia, decided to pursue the elusive blue LED despite his semiconductor division being on its "last legs" due to intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. His lab was poorly equipped, often experiencing explosions from phosphorus leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Despite disillusionment from supervisors who told him to quit, Nakamura, out of desperation, proposed the "moonshot project" to company founder Nobuo Ogawa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Ogawa, a risk-taker, gambled 500 million yen ($3 million), about 15% of Nichia's annual profit, on Nakamura's research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Three Radical Breakthroughs

Nakamura focused on gallium nitride (GaN) as his material, despite most researchers favoring zinc selenide due to GaN's notoriously difficult crystal growth and issues with p-type doping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Existing prototypes were also far too dim for commercial viability, requiring at least 1,000 microwatts of light output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

#### 1. High-Quality Crystal Growth
Nakamura first traveled to Florida for a year to master Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD), the best method for mass-producing clean crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Upon his return to Japan in 1989 with an order for a new MOCVD reactor, he faced skepticism from Nichia's new CEO, Eji Ogawa (Nobuo's son-in-law), who wanted him to cease GaN research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Nakamura defied these orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

After six months of failed attempts to grow GaN in his new reactor, Nakamura rebuilt it himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. His "two-flow reactor" design introduced a second nozzle to release a downward stream of inert gas, preventing gallium nitride reactant gases from forming powdery waste and instead pinning them to the substrate for uniform crystal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. This yielded GaN with electron mobility four times higher than previously achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. He then used this smooth and stable GaN as a buffer layer on sapphire substrates, producing the highest quality GaN crystals ever made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

#### 2. Creating P-type Gallium Nitride
The second major obstacle was creating p-type GaN. While Drs. Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano had achieved p-type behavior in magnesium-doped GaN by electron beam irradiation, the mechanism was unknown and the process was too slow for commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. Nakamura discovered that simply heating (annealing) the magnesium-doped GaN to 400 degrees Celsius achieved a completely p-type sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. He found that hydrogen atoms from the ammonia used in MOCVD were bonding with magnesium and plugging holes, and annealing released this hydrogen, freeing up the holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

#### 3. Increasing Light Output
By 1992, Nakamura had a prototype blue LED, but it was still inefficient (42 microwatts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. He focused on increasing its light output power to the 1,000 microwatt threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

A known technique for LED efficiency is to create an "active layer" (a "well") at the p-n junction, which slightly shrinks the band gap to encourage more electron-hole recombination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. The best active layer for GaN was indium gallium nitride (InGaN), which would also shift the color from blue-violet to true blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Indium and gallium nitride were difficult to mix, but Nakamura's customized MOCVD reactor allowed him to "brute force" the process, yielding a clean InGaN crystal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

After incorporating InGaN, electrons still leaked from the well. Nakamura solved this by adding a layer of aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN), a compound with a larger band gap, acting as a "hill" to block electrons from escaping the well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

## Impact and Legacy of the Blue LED

By 1992, Shūji Nakamura had completed the complex structure for the blue LED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. He created a bright blue LED, visible in daylight, with a light output of 1,500 microwatts and emitting at 450 nanometers – over 100 times brighter than previous pseudo-blue LEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.

Nichia announced the world's first true blue LED at a Tokyo press conference, stunning the electronics industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. The company's fortunes exploded; orders flooded in, and by the end of 1994, Nichia was manufacturing 1 million blue LEDs per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. Within three years, their revenue nearly doubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

In 1996, Nichia further advanced by creating the world's first white LED, achieved by placing a yellow phosphor over the blue LED to absorb blue photons and re-radiate them across the visible spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. This breakthrough unlocked the final frontier of LED lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. By 2001, Nichia's revenue was approaching $700 million annually, with over 60% coming from blue LED products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. Today, Nichia is a multi-billion dollar global LED manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

### Nakamura's Compensation and Recognition
Despite generating hundreds of millions in sales for Nichia, Nakamura received minimal compensation for his invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. He left Nichia in 2000 for the US and later counter-sued the company for inadequate compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. In 2001, Japanese courts initially ruled in his favor, ordering a payment 10 times his request, though it was eventually settled for $8 million, enough only to cover his legal fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

In 2014, Nakamura, Akasaki, and Amano were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on the blue LED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

### The Lighting Revolution
Today, the blue LED underpins an $80 billion industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. Modern LED bulbs are significantly more efficient and durable than incandescent or fluorescent bulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. They offer extensive customization, with high-end bulbs allowing for 50,000 different shades of white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. Their cost has dropped, with efficiency allowing users to recoup the initial investment in just two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.

This led to a lighting revolution: in 2010, only 1% of residential lighting sales were LED, but by 2022, it was over half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. Experts predict nearly all lighting sales will be LED within the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>. This widespread adoption could save an estimated 1.4 billion tons of CO2, equivalent to removing almost half the cars in the world from the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

### Future of LEDs
Nakamura's current research focuses on the next generation of LEDs: micro LEDs and UV LEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. Micro LEDs, as small as five microns, could enable near-eye displays for AR/VR applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. UV LEDs could be used for surface sterilization in hospitals or kitchens, capable of killing pathogens in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. While their current efficiency is low and cost high, Nakamura believes efficiency will increase, making them comparable to mercury lamps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

Yo-yo master Ben Conde demonstrates advanced yo-yo tricks where the string appears not to be connected to the yo-yo, performing insane maneuvers [00:00:33]. The mechanics behind these impressive feats rely on the yo-yo's inherent physics and specific design elements [00:00:30].

## Initial Release and Energy Conversion
When a yo-yo is released, it unspools as it falls, converting its initial gravitational potential energy into kinetic and rotational energy [00:01:08]. Yo-yos can achieve very high spin rates, up to around 6,000 revolutions per minute, which is comparable to the speed of most car engines [00:01:16].

## [[gyroscopic_stability_in_yoyos | Gyroscopic Stability]]
This rapid rotation is crucial because it provides the yo-yo with [[gyroscopic_stability_in_yoyos | gyroscopic stability]] [00:01:24]. This stability ensures that the yo-yo's axis of rotation is maintained, even when subjected to external disturbances like a breeze [00:01:32]. Due to its significant angular momentum, the yo-yo continues to spin in the same direction [00:01:36].

## Re-engaging the String (The "Bind")
To bring the yo-yo back or make it roll up, Ben tugs the string, pulling it from one side of the yo-yo to the other [00:01:42]. As the yo-yo continues to spin, this action causes the string to bind to the spool, allowing the yo-yo to start rolling up the string [00:01:46]. A close look at slow-motion footage can show the exact moment the string binds to the spool, preventing the yo-yo from unravelling further and falling off the string [00:01:50].

## Releasing the Yo-Yo (The "Unspool")
To make the yo-yo appear "stringless," Ben throws it out and upwards without pulling back [00:02:09]. This action allows the yo-yo to completely unspool, detaching from the string while maintaining its high rate of rotation [00:02:11].

## Catching the Yo-Yo: The Role of [[role_of_friction_in_yoyo_performance | Friction]]
Catching the unspooled, rapidly spinning yo-yo with just a string is achieved through [[role_of_friction_in_yoyo_performance | friction]] [00:02:16].

### [[role_of_friction_in_yoyo_performance | Friction]] Pads
Modern yo-yos often incorporate [[role_of_friction_in_yoyo_performance | friction pads]], typically made of silicone, located inside a small gap within the yo-yo [00:02:20]. When the string is lodged into this gap, it creates [[role_of_friction_in_yoyo_performance | friction]] that allows the spinning yo-yo to roll up the string [00:02:27]. If the string is successfully lodged into this gap, it catches on the [[role_of_friction_in_yoyo_performance | friction pads]], and the yo-yo begins to roll up the string again [00:02:38].

### Belt [[role_of_friction_in_yoyo_performance | Friction]] Equation
Even without dedicated [[role_of_friction_in_yoyo_performance | friction pads]], simply wrapping the string around the axle creates significant [[role_of_friction_in_yoyo_performance | friction]] [00:02:45]. This principle is similar to how ropes wrapped around bollards can hold large ships to their docks [00:02:48]. The amount of tension a coiled rope or string can hold is described by the belt [[role_of_friction_in_yoyo_performance | friction]] equation [00:02:54]. This equation demonstrates that the force the string can exert on the yo-yo increases exponentially with the angle the string makes around the axle [00:03:01]. Therefore, even a few turns of the string around the yo-yo's axle are enough for the user to pull it back into their hand [00:03:05].

The actions of individual scientists can have monumental impacts on the environment, leading to both significant harm and crucial remediation efforts. One scientist, in particular, is noted for creating three inventions that accidentally led to the deaths of millions, decreased average global intelligence, increased crime rates, and caused two separate environmental disasters still being dealt with today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Thomas Midgley Jr.: A Legacy of Environmental Harm

Thomas Midgley Jr., a 27-year-old engineer hired by Charles Kettering, sought an additive to increase the octane rating of fuel and eliminate engine knocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:08">[07:08:08]</a>.

### The Invention of Leaded Gasoline

In 1921, after five years of research, Midgley discovered tetraethyl lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:28">[08:21:28]</a>. This additive effectively stopped engine knocking, didn't smell, was cheap to produce, and only required one part in 1000 to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:46">[08:35:46]</a>. Midgley and Kettering patented the process and named their new additive "Ethyl," possibly to confuse it with ethyl alcohol, and made no mention of lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:06">[09:11:06]</a>. They partnered with General Motors, DuPont, and Standard Oil of New Jersey to form the Ethyl Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:38">[09:26:38]</a>.

Despite its market success, exemplified by the top three finishers at the 1923 Indianapolis 500 using Ethyl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:07">[10:03:07]</a>, the product quickly showed its dangers. Within two months of operating a new chemical plant, dozens of workers fell ill with lead poisoning, and five died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:11">[10:16:11]</a>.

Midgley publicly demonstrated the supposed safety of tetraethyl lead by pouring it on his hands and inhaling it for a full minute, claiming he could do this daily without harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:43">[10:29:43]</a>. However, he knew the dangers firsthand, having spent much of 1923 recovering from lead poisoning himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:40">[10:41:40]</a>.

### The Dangers of Lead

Lead is highly dangerous even in small doses, mimicking calcium in the body and having no efficient way to be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:19">[11:00:19]</a>. It can be stored in bones for years, leading to prolonged poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:08">[11:07:08]</a>. The brain is particularly sensitive, with lead breaking down myelin sheaths and preventing neurotransmitter release, causing symptoms like headaches, memory loss, and tingling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:35">[11:17:35]</a>. Children are especially vulnerable, experiencing permanent learning disorders and behavioral problems from exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:07">[11:31:07]</a>.

The toxicity of lead had been known for hundreds of years; Benjamin Franklin noted its toxicity in 1786 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:37">[11:37:37]</a>. Doctors and public health officials from institutions like MIT, Harvard, Yale, and the US Health Service warned Midgley against producing tetraethyl lead, calling it a "creeping and malicious poison" and a "serious menace to public health" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:19">[12:04:19]</a>. These concerns were dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:24">[12:18:24]</a>.

### Environmental and Societal Consequences of Leaded Fuel

By the 1950s, millions of motorists globally were releasing lead into the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. Studies showed modern Americans had a thousand times more lead in their bones than Peruvian and Egyptian mummies from over 1600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:40">[16:21:40]</a>.

Lead exposure, even below levels once considered safe, caused delayed learning, decreased IQ, and increased behavioral problems in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:59">[16:37:59]</a>. The CDC's guidelines for acceptable lead levels in children's blood dropped drastically from 60 micrograms per deciliter to 3.5, with the current understanding being that there is no safe level of lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.

Globally, lead is believed to be responsible for nearly two-thirds of all unexplained intellectual disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:44">[17:23:44]</a>. A 2022 study estimated that over half of the current US population (170 million people) were exposed to high lead levels in early childhood, leading to a loss of more than 800 million IQ points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:04">[17:30:04]</a>.

Beyond cognitive impacts, lead exposure is correlated with crime rates. The rise in US crime from the 1970s to the 1990s, followed by an abrupt decline, eerily mirrors preschool blood lead levels offset by 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:44">[18:02:44]</a>. Similar patterns are seen in Britain, Canada, and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:02">[18:28:02]</a>. A causal connection exists between lead exposure and antisocial or violent behavior; a study of 340 teenagers found arrested individuals were four times as likely to have elevated lead in their bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:13">[18:36:13]</a>.

The precise death toll from lead is difficult to estimate, but its effect on hardening arteries contributes to cardiovascular disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:04">[19:02:04]</a>. A 2018 study suggested lead was responsible for 250,000 heart disease deaths per year in the US, potentially amounting to 25 million deaths over the past century in the US alone, and possibly approaching 100 million globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:04">[19:10:04]</a>. Current estimates suggest lead causes 500,000 to 900,000 deaths per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:58">[19:42:58]</a>.

### The Invention of CFCs (Freon)

Midgley also invented dichlorodifluoromethane, branded as Freon, in 1928, as a safer alternative to toxic and flammable [[refrigerants_and_the_environmental_impact_of_cfcs | refrigerants]] like methyl formate and sulfur dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:07">[20:19:07]</a>. He publicly demonstrated Freon's safety by inhaling a lungful of the gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:40">[20:41:40]</a>.

CFCs became popular as solvents and aerosols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:07">[20:55:07]</a>. However, their stability allowed them to reach the stratosphere, where UV light broke them apart, releasing chlorine atoms that reacted with and depleted the ozone layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:03">[21:01:03]</a>. This led to increased UV penetration, raising rates of skin cancer and cataracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:01">[21:32:01]</a>. CFCs are also potent greenhouse gases, producing 10,000 times more warming per kilogram than CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:04">[21:38:04]</a>. Historian John McNeil suggested Midgley had "more impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth's history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:04">[21:47:04]</a>.

The Montreal Protocol, an agreement to phase out CFCs, went into effect in 1989, and the ozone layer is now showing signs of recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:04">[21:55:04]</a>.

Midgley died in 1944 at age 51, having contracted polio. He became tangled in the ropes of a mechanical bed he devised to help him get up and died of strangulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:04">[22:08:04]</a>.

## [[clair_pattersons_work_on_measuring_earths_age_and_lead_contamination | Clair Patterson]]: The Champion Against Lead Pollution

[[clair_pattersons_work_on_measuring_earths_age_and_lead_contamination | Clair Patterson]], a chemist who worked on the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>, later pursued a PhD to measure the age of the Earth using mass spectrometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.

### Uncovering Lead Contamination

Patterson's project involved measuring the ratio of uranium to lead in primordial rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:04">[01:43:04]</a>. His lead measurements were consistently and significantly higher than expected, indicating lead contamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:04">[02:25:04]</a>. This mystery would consume the rest of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:04">[02:43:04]</a>.

In 1952, Patterson moved to Caltech and built a new lab, inventing the "cleanroom" to avoid environmental contamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:04">[12:53:04]</a>. He removed lead solder from electrical cables, cleaned surfaces daily with ammonia, and ensured air was constantly blown out of the lab, requiring plastic bunny suits for entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:04">[12:57:04]</a>.

Patterson accurately measured the age of the Earth at 4.55 billion years by analyzing meteorites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:04">[13:46:04]</a>, but he continued his work against lead contaminants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:04">[14:14:04]</a>.

### Proving Human-Caused Lead Pollution

While the Ethyl Corporation and its funded scientists claimed lead was a natural part of the environment, Patterson set out to prove otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:04">[14:36:04]</a>.

His research on lead in oceans showed concentrations were nearly 10 times higher near the surface, indicating recent pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:04">[14:57:04]</a>. By analyzing ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, Patterson demonstrated that atmospheric lead levels had been elevated for the last 4500 years due to human activity, mainly smelting ores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:04">[15:28:04]</a>. The ice cores clearly showed spikes corresponding to the rise of Greek and Roman Empires, a dip during the Black Death, and a massive spike in the 20th century due to industrialization and tetraethyl lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:04">[15:47:04]</a>.

Patterson's work revealed that the lead in our environment was not natural, and burning lead in combustion engines had spread this toxic element across the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:04">[22:30:04]</a>.

### Global Action Against Leaded Fuel

Japan was the first country to ban leaded fuel in 1986, with Algeria being the last in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:04">[22:47:04]</a>. The UN estimates that the elimination of lead from gasoline saves over a million lives per year and $2.45 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:58:04">[22:58:04]</a>. However, leaded gasoline is still used in piston-driven airplane engines, which are now the largest source of lead emissions into the air in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:04">[23:08:04]</a>.

Benjamin Franklin's observation in 1786 remains pertinent: "you will observe with concern how long a useful truth may be known and exist before it is generally received and practiced on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:04">[23:18:04]</a>.

The stories of Thomas Midgley and [[clair_pattersons_work_on_measuring_earths_age_and_lead_contamination | Clair Patterson]] highlight the profound impact a single individual can have on the environment, whether for widespread detriment or for significant global improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:04">[23:35:04]</a>. Organizations like Wren work to combat climate change by supporting projects that reduce greenhouse gases, emphasizing the importance of both systemic change and individual environmentally friendly choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45:04">[23:45:04]</a>.

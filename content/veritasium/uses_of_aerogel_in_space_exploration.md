[[Aerogel]] is recognized as the world's lightest and least dense solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A given piece of aerogel can have a mass of just 1.22 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, being only a few times the mass of the same volume of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This is because it is 99.8% air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, and some types are so light that if all air were removed, they would be less dense than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. These [[properties of aerogel | unique properties]] make it highly suitable for [[applications in aerospace and space technology | applications in aerospace and space technology]].

## Thermal Insulation in Rovers

NASA has utilized [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] for insulation on various Mars rovers, including the Sojourner Rover, Spirit and Opportunity, and the Curiosity Rover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. It is also planned for use on future missions to Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

The primary reason for its use is to protect electronics from the extreme cold temperatures experienced during the Martian nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. While aerogel is largely comprised of air, it possesses better insulating capabilities than air itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This enhanced [[thermal_insulation_capabilities_of_aerogel | thermal insulation]] is due to the Knudsen effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. The width of the aerogel's pores is smaller than the average distance air molecules travel before colliding (their mean free path) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This structure makes it difficult for hot, fast-moving air molecules to diffuse through the aerogel and transfer heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Particle Capture (Stardust Mission)

NASA has also employed [[aerogel_properties_and_composition | aerogel]] for more specialized purposes, notably in the Stardust mission to capture dust from a comet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

During the mission, particles traveled at approximately six kilometers per second relative to the aerogel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Because aerogel is a very low-density and highly porous material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, the particles could enter the aerogel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. As they passed through, they broke apart the aerogel's network, losing energy and eventually coming to a stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This method is effective for capturing particles because if such a particle were to hit a solid surface, it would stop immediately and vaporize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

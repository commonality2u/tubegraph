Almost eight years ago, a video was made demonstrating that cutting a grape almost completely in half and placing it in a microwave could [[microwaving_grapes_to_create_plasma | produce plasma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Initially, the explanation for this phenomenon was lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, [[scientific_studies_on_plasma_generation_with_microwaves | three scientists]] have since published a detailed explanation in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, based on studies using high-speed and thermal cameras, and [[electromagnetic_fields_and_refractive_index_in_grapes | electromagnetic modeling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## How Microwaves Interact with Grapes

A typical household microwave operates at a frequency of approximately 2.45 gigahertz, meaning the wavelength of microwaves in the oven's air is about 12 centimeters long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. While a grape is not 12 centimeters in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, the crucial factor is the wavelength *inside* the grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The [[electromagnetic_fields_and_refractive_index_in_grapes | refractive index]] of grape material in the microwave regime is almost 10, much higher than its visible wavelength refractive index of about 1.33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This high [[electromagnetic_fields_and_refractive_index_in_grapes | refractive index]] causes microwaves to travel ten times slower through the grape than through air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Consequently, the wavelength *inside* the grape is reduced to about 1.2 centimeters, which is roughly the size of a grape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Microwave Trapping and Resonant Modes

When a single, uncut grape is placed in a microwave, the microwaves become trapped inside it due to its high [[electromagnetic_fields_and_refractive_index_in_grapes | refractive index]] and size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This trapping occurs because the grape's diameter is roughly the same as the microwave's wavelength within the material, leading to interactions where microwaves bounce off the borders and cannot escape, similar to total internal reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Inside the grape, these trapped microwaves form resonant modes, also known as standing waves, where the [[electromagnetic_fields_and_refractive_index_in_grapes | electromagnetic fields]] prefer to oscillate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The maximum [[electromagnetic_fields_and_refractive_index_in_grapes | electromagnetic field]] strength is located at the center of the grape, causing it to heat up from the inside out, rather than outside in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This heating pattern holds true for additional grapes as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Field Concentration and Plasma Generation

When two grapes are moved close enough to touch (closer than a wavelength), their [[electromagnetic_fields_and_refractive_index_in_grapes | electromagnetic fields]] interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The greatest [[electromagnetic_fields_and_refractive_index_in_grapes | electromagnetic field]] concentration occurs at the contact point between the two grapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This is where the grapes get hottest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Interestingly, it's not necessary to cut the grapes in half; two grapes placed side-by-side will produce the effect as long as they remain in contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This is why a watch glass is often used in videos, to keep the grapes together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

At the intersection of the two grapes, the strong [[electromagnetic_fields_and_refractive_index_in_grapes | electromagnetic fields]] can cause sparks and the breakdown of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The electric fields become strong enough to ionize the air, creating those sparks that lead to [[microwaving_grapes_to_create_plasma | plasma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. These newly formed ions then absorb more energy from the microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The plasma can be observed pulsing at 120 Hertz, which is twice the 60 Hertz frequency of mains power, reflecting the amplitude pulsing of the microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Analysis of the grape [[microwaving_grapes_to_create_plasma | plasma]] spectrum reveals strong potassium and sodium emission lines, indicating that these ions are common in grapes and are sprayed into the air when the [[microwaving_grapes_to_create_plasma | plasma]] forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Importance of Size and Absorption

The size of the grapes is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. If the grape material did not absorb microwaves, extreme amplification of [[electromagnetic_fields_and_refractive_index_in_grapes | electromagnetic fields]] would only occur at very specific sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. However, since water absorbs microwaves, this absorption broadens the peaks of field amplification, allowing a wider range of grape sizes to still produce the effect, albeit with less amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Hydrogel Beads

The [[scientific_studies_on_plasma_generation_with_microwaves | scientists]] discovered that the same [[microwaving_grapes_to_create_plasma | plasma]] effect can be achieved without grapes, by using hydrogel water beads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. These tiny polymer beads expand significantly (up to 100 times their volume) when soaked in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The behavior of these beads in a microwave is analogous to that of grapes, demonstrating that the phenomenon is related to the water content, [[electromagnetic_fields_and_refractive_index_in_grapes | refractive index]], and size relative to the microwave wavelength inside the material.

## Potential Applications

Beyond being a "fun trick," this research has potential applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The phenomenon shows that two spheres of the correct size and [[electromagnetic_fields_and_refractive_index_in_grapes | refractive index]] can focus [[electromagnetic_fields_and_refractive_index_in_grapes | electromagnetic energy]] into a tiny spot between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. In this case, 12-centimeter microwaves were focused down to about a millimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. If similar focusing precision could be achieved with light, it could significantly improve current lithography techniques, which are a main limit in fabricating smaller microchips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This capability could enable writing features as small as 2 nanometers, potentially helping to continue Moore's Law by allowing more components on a single chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

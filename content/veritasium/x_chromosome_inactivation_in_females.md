Inside each human cell, there are six feet of [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]], composed of six billion letters of genetic code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]] is divided into 46 pieces, each 3 to 4 cm long, known as [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosomes]] are often depicted in a condensed, X-like form, they only adopt this shape when a cell is preparing to divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Ordinarily, [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]] exists as a wiggly thread within the nucleus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Considering [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]] is only about 2 nanometers wide, but a [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] can be centimeters long, it's efficiently packaged to prevent tangling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This packaging is achieved by wrapping [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]] around proteins called [[Role of Histones in DNA Packing | histones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. These [[Role of Histones in DNA Packing | histones]] possess "wiggly tails" which play a crucial role in [[Epigenetics and Gene Expression | epigenetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Genetic Inheritance

An individual's unique set of [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]] is formed when 23 [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosomes]] from the mother combine with 23 [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosomes]] from the father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Of these, 22 [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosomes]] from each parent form matching pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The 23rd set comprises the sex [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Two X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosomes]] result in a female, while an X and a Y [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] result in a male <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## The Process of X Chromosome Inactivation

In males, both the X and Y sex [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosomes]] can remain active throughout life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. However, in females, one of the X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosomes]] must be inactivated to ensure proper development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This vital process occurs very early in development, when a female embryo is merely four days old and consists of only about 100 cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

At this initial stage, both the X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] inherited from the father and the one from the mother are active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Through a "tiny molecular battle," one X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] "wins" and remains active, while the other is inactivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The inactivation process involves several key molecular modifications:
*   **DNA Packing**: The [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]] of the inactive X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] is packed more closely together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Histone Modifications**: Modifications are made to the "dangly" [[Role of Histones in DNA Packing | histone]] tails, signaling inactivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Structural Proteins**: New structural proteins are added to bind everything even more closely together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Methyl Groups**: Tiny molecular markers called methyl groups are added to the [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]], signaling to the cell that this [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]] should not be "read" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

These combined mechanisms make the [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]] of the inactivated X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] very difficult for the molecular machinery to access and harness its genetic code; essentially, this [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]] is "switched off" or "silenced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

In contrast, the active X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]] is more spread out, allowing better access to its genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. [[Role of Histones in DNA Packing | Histones]] can be slid along the [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]] or entirely removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, and their tails bear different modifications, signaling that this [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]] is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This accessibility allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]] into messenger RNA (mRNA), which then moves into the cell to be used for protein synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Randomness and Pattern Maintenance

A surprising aspect of X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] inactivation is its apparent randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. In some cells, the X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] from the father is inactivated, while in others, the mother's X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] is inactivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Consequently, the 100-cell embryo develops with a mixture of cells, each having a different active X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

From this point forward, as these initial cells divide, they consistently maintain the same active X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. For example, all cells originating from a cell with the father's active X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] will continue to have the father's active X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This pattern persists into adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. If one could observe X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] inactivation in a woman's skin, a stripy pattern would be visible, reflecting the growth and migration of these initial 100 cells from the four-day-old embryo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Visible Example: Calico Cats

While this stripy pattern isn't directly observable in humans, it is clearly visible in [[Calico Cats as an Example of Epigenetics | Calico cats]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This is because the gene for coat color in cats is located on the X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. By observing the pattern of a [[Calico Cats as an Example of Epigenetics | Calico cat]]'s dark and light spots, one can determine which X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] (from the mother or father) has been inactivated in different areas of her body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This also explains why only female cats can be [[Calico Cats as an Example of Epigenetics | Calico cats]], as only females inherit two X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosomes]] potentially carrying different color genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Broader Implications of Epigenetics

X [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]] inactivation is a remarkable example of [[Epigenetics and Gene Expression | epigenetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. [[Epigenetics and Gene Expression | Epigenetics]] is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | DNA]] sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. While X inactivation affects an entire [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosome]], [[Epigenetics and Gene Expression | epigenetics]] more commonly operates by turning individual genes on and off across all [[Structure of DNA and Chromosomes | chromosomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

For instance, [[Epigenetics and Gene Expression | epigenetics]] is responsible for making a pancreatic cell capable of producing insulin by switching on the relevant gene in that cell, while keeping it switched off in other cell types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Even more fascinating, an individual's behaviors can affect their [[Epigenetics and Gene Expression | epigenetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Surprisingly, the behaviors of one's parents or even grandparents can also influence an individual's [[Epigenetics and Gene Expression | epigenetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This highlights that an individual is not merely a product of their [[Genetic factors in mosquito attraction | genetic factors in mosquito attraction | genetic code]] or [[The role of DNA in determining attractiveness to mosquitoes | DNA]], but also a product of their [[Epigenetics and Gene Expression | epigenetics]], which is shaped by their own behavior and the behavior of their ancestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

As a young chemist, Clair Patterson worked on the Manhattan Project in 1944, concentrating uranium-235 for nuclear weapons from uranium-238 using mass spectrometers [00:00:30]. After the war, Patterson pursued his PhD, choosing a research project that leveraged his experience with mass spectrometers: measuring the age of the Earth [00:01:04].

## Initial Challenges with Lead Contamination

Patterson's project aimed to determine Earth's age by measuring the ratio of uranium to lead in primordial rocks [00:01:43]. This method relies on the consistent decay rate of radioactive rocks, such as uranium-238 decaying into stable lead-206 over 4.5 billion years [00:01:18].

To calibrate his instrument, Patterson used zircon crystals, which are ideal because they contain trace amounts of uranium when they form but no lead, meaning any lead found later must be from uranium decay [00:01:52]. While his colleague George Tilton's uranium measurements were consistent, Patterson's lead measurements were erratic and much higher than expected [00:02:21]. This unexplained excess lead became a lifelong mystery for Patterson [00:02:40].

## The Source of Contamination: Leaded Gasoline

The widespread use of tetraethyl lead, an additive developed by [[the_legacy_and_controversies_of_thomas_midgley_jr | Thomas Midgley Jr.]] to prevent engine knocking in gasoline, was the culprit [00:08:21, 00:10:08]. By the 1950s, millions of cars globally were burning leaded gasoline, releasing lead into the atmosphere [00:12:38]. This lead contaminated Patterson's zircon samples, hindering his age determination efforts [00:12:46].

## Inventing the Cleanroom

In 1952, suspicious of environmental contamination, Patterson moved to Caltech and built a new, meticulously clean laboratory [00:12:53]. He took extreme measures to eliminate lead, including:
*   Removing lead solder from electrical cables [00:13:00].
*   Daily cleaning of floors and benches with ammonia [00:13:04].
*   Ensuring air was constantly blown out of the lab [00:13:07].
*   Requiring plastic "bunny suits" to be worn inside [00:13:10].

These efforts essentially led Patterson to invent the cleanroom [00:13:15].

## Dating the Earth with Meteorites

Inside his cleanroom, Patterson shifted his focus to meteorites, recognizing them as the oldest rocks in the solar system [00:13:19]. Unlike Earth's original rocks, which had been destroyed by tectonic activity, meteorites originated from asteroids that formed around the same time as Earth and had drifted through space [00:13:23].

Patterson measured five meteorites using three different radiometric dating techniques [00:13:46]. His findings consistently showed they were all 4.55 billion years old [00:13:50]. This groundbreaking number is within 0.15% of the currently accepted age of the Earth [00:13:59]. Before Patterson's experiment, the Earth was thought to be a billion years younger [00:14:04]. His work provided a definitive age for our planet [00:14:10].

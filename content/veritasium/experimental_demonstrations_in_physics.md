[[applying_physics_in_educational_demonstrations | Experimental demonstrations]] can illustrate complex physical phenomena in an engaging way. One such demonstration involves a large spinning flywheel to show the effects of gyroscopic precession.

## The Apparatus
A key piece of equipment for this demonstration is a 19 kilogram (40 pound) flywheel attached to the end of a meter-long shaft, built by the mechanical engineering shop at the University of Sydney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Demonstrations

### Non-Spinning Challenges
Without the flywheel spinning, it is virtually impossible to hold the shaft horizontally with one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Similarly, lifting the apparatus over one's head with a single hand when the flywheel is not spinning is extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, highlighting the significant weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The flywheel alone weighs about 19 kilograms (42 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Spinning Flywheel: Horizontal Hold
When the flywheel is spun up to a few thousand RPM, it becomes possible to hold the shaft horizontally with just one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The shaft remains horizontal, creating the appearance that the wheel is almost weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Spinning Flywheel: Overhead Lift
The effect is even more pronounced when attempting to lift the spinning flywheel over one's head with a single hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. With the flywheel spinning as fast as possible, the lift feels "incredibly light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The subjective experience is that the apparatus feels like it is "wanting to go up by itself," requiring less force than expected to lift such a weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### The Physics: Gyroscopic Precession
This phenomenon is explained by gyroscopic precession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Instead of pulling the wheel directly down to the ground, the weight of the flywheel creates a torque that causes it to move around in a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Weight vs. Apparent Weight
> Despite the feeling of lightness, the flywheel is not truly weightless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. If released, it would still fall to the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The apparent reduction in effort is due to the principles of gyroscopic motion.

### Further Experimentation
To objectively measure the effect on perceived weight, an [[physics_of_flywheels | experiment]] can be designed using a scale. By standing on a scale while lifting the spinning flywheel, one can observe if the total weight reading changes, thus determining if there is an "in essence" lightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. An individual's weight might be around 72 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. When holding the non-spinning flywheel, the scale might read approximately 91 kilograms (72 kg personal weight + 19 kg flywheel weight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The question then becomes whether the scale reading will be more, less than, or equal to 91 kilograms while lifting the *spinning* flywheel over one's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

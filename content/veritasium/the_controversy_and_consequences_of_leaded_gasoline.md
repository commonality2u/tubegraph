The development and widespread adoption of leaded gasoline, primarily due to the discovery of tetraethyl lead by [[the_legacy_and_controversies_of_thomas_midgley_jr | Thomas Midgley Jr]]., led to significant global health and environmental crises before its eventual phase-out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Discovery of Tetraethyl Lead

In 1908, a fatal accident involving a car's hand crank led to Henry Leland, founder of Cadillac, commissioning Charles Kettering to develop a self-starting car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. By 1911, Kettering had a working prototype, which resulted in the Cadillac Model 30, a powerful car that doubled Cadillac's annual sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. However, the Model 30's high-compression engine suffered from "engine knocking," a loud and damaging issue caused by premature fuel combustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

Kettering hired [[the_legacy_and_controversies_of_thomas_midgley_jr | Thomas Midgley Jr]]. in 1917 to find an additive to increase the octane rating of fuel and eliminate knocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. After five years of experimentation, Midgley discovered tetraethyl lead in December 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This additive was effective, odorless, cheap, and only required one part in a thousand to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Midgley and Kettering patented the process and named the additive "Ethyl," possibly to avoid association with lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. They partnered with General Motors, DuPont, and Standard Oil of New Jersey to form the Ethyl Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Early Warnings and Corporate Dismissal

Despite the commercial success of leaded gasoline, exemplified by its use by the top three finishers at the 1923 Indianapolis 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, severe problems arose quickly.

Within two months of the Ethyl Corporation's New Jersey plant opening, dozens of workers fell ill with lead poisoning, and five died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. In response to public outcry, Midgley publicly demonstrated what he claimed was the safety of tetraethyl lead by pouring it on his hands and inhaling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. However, Midgley himself had spent much of 1923 recovering from lead poisoning in Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

The dangers of lead had been known for hundreds of years, with Benjamin Franklin commenting on its known toxicity in 1786 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Doctors and public health officials from institutions like MIT, Harvard, Yale, and the US Health Service warned Midgley against producing tetraethyl lead, calling it a "creeping and malicious poison" and a "serious menace to public health" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. These concerns were dismissed by corporations, with the President of Standard Oil, Frank Howard, stating they would not give up what had "come to the industry like a gift from heaven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Scientists funded by the Ethyl Corporation claimed lead was a natural part of the environment and therefore not harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

## Clair Patterson's Investigation into Lead Contamination

Chemist Clair Patterson, who had experience with mass spectrometers from his work on the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, initially encountered lead contamination while trying to measure the age of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. His zircon samples, which should have contained no lead upon formation, showed mysteriously high and inconsistent lead measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

This led Patterson to build a new, ultra-clean lab at Caltech in 1952, effectively inventing the cleanroom, to avoid environmental contamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. In this clean environment, he successfully measured the age of meteorites—and thus the Earth—at 4.55 billion years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

Patterson then turned his attention to determining how natural the lead in the environment truly was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Oceanic Lead Levels:** He measured lead in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, finding concentrations nearly 10 times higher near the surface, indicating recent pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.
*   **Ice Core Analysis:** By analyzing ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, Patterson found that atmospheric lead levels had been elevated for 4,500 years due to human activity like smelting, but showed a significant spike in the 20th century due to industrialization and tetraethyl lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   **Human Lead Levels:** Comparing lead levels in the bones and teeth of recently deceased Americans to Peruvian and Egyptian mummies, Patterson found that 20th-century Americans had about 1,000 times more lead in their bones than their ancestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

## [[Impact of tetraethyl lead on global health | Consequences of Leaded Gasoline]]

Patterson's research and subsequent studies revealed devastating [[Impact of tetraethyl lead on global health | health and societal impacts]]:

*   **Cognitive and Behavioral Impairment:** Lead is dangerous even in small doses, mimicking calcium in the body and affecting the brain by breaking down myelin and preventing neurotransmitter release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Symptoms include headaches, memory loss, and tingling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Children are particularly susceptible, with lead exposure causing permanent learning disorders, decreased IQ, and behavioral problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Studies of baby teeth showed a strong correlation between higher lead levels and increased likelihood of failing high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Globally, lead is believed to be responsible for nearly two-thirds of all unexplained intellectual disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. A 2022 study estimated that over half the current US population (170 million people) were exposed to high levels of lead in early childhood, resulting in an aggregate loss of over 800 million IQ points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **Increased Crime Rates:** There's a troubling correlation between preschool blood lead levels and crime rates, offset by about 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. This pattern has been observed in many countries, and a causal connection between lead exposure and antisocial or violent behavior is known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Mortality:** One of the lesser-known effects of lead is the hardening of arteries, leading to increased cardiovascular disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. A 2018 study found lead was likely responsible for 250,000 heart disease deaths per year in the US, amounting to 25 million deaths over the past century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Globally, the figure may approach 100 million deaths, mostly attributed to Midgley's decision to put lead in gasoline for profit despite knowing its toxicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

The problem persists, with current estimates of lead-caused deaths ranging from 500,000 to 900,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. A 2020 UNICEF report warned that one in three children globally (over 800 million) have blood lead levels at or above five micrograms per deciliter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. While lead from batteries and industrial processes contribute, some contamination is still due to Midgley's invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

### Broader Environmental Impact

[[the_legacy_and_controversies_of_thomas_midgley_jr | Thomas Midgley Jr]]. was also responsible for the development of Freon (dichlorodifluoromethane), a non-toxic and non-flammable refrigerant that became widely popular as a [[CFCs and their environmental effects | CFC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. These [[CFCs and their environmental effects | CFCs]] were later found to climb into the stratosphere, where they break apart due to UV light, releasing chlorine atoms that destroy the ozone layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. This led to another [[Environmental and health impacts of PFAS chemicals | environmental disaster]]: the hole in the ozone layer, increasing rates of skin cancer and cataracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. [[CFCs and their environmental effects | CFCs]] are also potent greenhouse gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. Historian John McNeil suggested Midgley had more impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

## Phase-Out and Legacy

Thanks to the work of Clair Patterson, the non-natural origin and widespread distribution of lead from combustion engines became clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Japan was the first country to ban leaded fuel in cars in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Algeria was the last to do so in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. The UN calculates that the elimination of lead from gasoline saves over a million lives per year and $2.45 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

Despite its global phase-out, leaded gasoline is still used in piston-driven airplane engines, which are now the largest source of lead emissions into the air in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. As Benjamin Franklin noted, "You will observe with concern how long a useful truth may be known and exist before it is generally received and practiced on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.

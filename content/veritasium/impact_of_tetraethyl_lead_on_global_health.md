Tetraethyl lead, marketed as "Ethyl" in gasoline, was developed by chemist Thomas Midgley Jr. in 1921. While intended to solve engine knocking in automobiles, its widespread use led to severe, long-lasting global health and environmental consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Development and Initial Concerns
The development of tetraethyl lead stemmed from a need to address "engine knocking" in early, more powerful internal combustion engines, such as the Cadillac Model 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This knocking occurred when the fuel-air mixture spontaneously combusted before the spark plug ignition, leading to turbulent pressure waves that damaged the engine and reduced performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Thomas Midgley Jr., hired by Charles Kettering, sought an additive to increase fuel's octane rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. After years of experimentation, he discovered tetraethyl lead on December 3, 1921, finding it cheap, readily available, effective at low concentrations, and odorless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Midgley and Kettering patented the process and, alongside General Motors, DuPont, and Standard Oil of New Jersey, formed the Ethyl Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. They marketed their new additive as "Ethyl," potentially to avoid association with lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

Despite its success in improving engine performance, the new product quickly raised serious health concerns. Within two months of operation, dozens of workers at a new Ethyl Corporation plant in New Jersey fell ill, and five died from lead poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Midgley himself had suffered from lead poisoning in 1923 and declined public talks about the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. However, to quell public outcry, he famously held a press conference where he poured tetraethyl lead onto his hands and inhaled it, claiming it was harmless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Doctors and public health officials from institutions like MIT, Harvard, Yale, and the US Health Service warned against its production, calling lead a "creeping and malicious poison" and a "serious menace to public health," but their concerns were dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

## The Dangers of Lead Exposure
Lead is highly dangerous even in small doses because it mimics calcium in the body, making it difficult to excrete and allowing it to be stored in bones for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The brain is particularly sensitive to lead, which can damage the myelin sheath and prevent neurotransmitter release, leading to symptoms like headaches, memory loss, and tingling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Children are especially vulnerable, with lead exposure causing permanent learning disorders and behavioral problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The toxicity of lead had been known for hundreds of years, with Benjamin Franklin remarking on its dangers in 1786 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

### Clair Patterson's Critical Research
Chemist Clair Patterson, who worked on the Manhattan Project, became instrumental in revealing the extent of [[the_controversy_and_consequences_of_leaded_gasoline | leaded gasoline]]'s impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While trying to measure the age of the Earth using the ratio of uranium to lead in primordial rocks, he found his lead measurements were contaminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This led him to suspect environmental lead contamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Patterson developed what is now known as the "cleanroom" to avoid lead contamination in his lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

Patterson's research went beyond his primary goal of dating the Earth:
*   **Oceanic Lead Levels**: He measured lead concentrations in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, finding them nearly 10 times higher near the surface, indicating recent pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Ice Core Analysis**: By analyzing ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, Patterson showed that atmospheric lead levels had been elevated for 4,500 years due to human activities like smelting ores, but spiked dramatically in the 20th century due to industrialization and tetraethyl lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   **Human Lead Burden**: He compared lead levels in the bones and teeth of recently deceased Americans with those of ancient Peruvian and Egyptian mummies. He found that 20th-century Americans had up to 1,000 times more lead in their bones than their ancestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

## Widespread and Persistent Impacts
Patterson's work, along with subsequent studies, unveiled the pervasive and devastating [[environmental_and_health_impacts_of_pfas_chemicals | health impacts of radiation exposure]] of [[the_controversy_and_consequences_of_leaded_gasoline | leaded gasoline]]:

### Cognitive Decline
Studies on baby teeth revealed that even lead exposure below levels once considered safe resulted in delayed learning, decreased IQ, and increased behavioral problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Globally, lead is believed to be responsible for nearly two-thirds of all unexplained intellectual disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. A 2022 study estimated that over half of the current US population (170 million people), particularly those born between 1951 and 1980, were exposed to high lead levels in early childhood, leading to an aggregate loss of over 800 million IQ points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. The world is less intelligent today because of [[the_controversy_and_consequences_of_leaded_gasoline | leaded gasoline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

### Increased Crime Rates
There is a troubling correlation between lead exposure and crime rates. The rise and fall of US crime rates from the 1970s to the 1990s eerily mirrors preschool blood lead levels, offset by 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. This pattern has been observed in other countries like Britain, Canada, and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. A causal connection between lead exposure and antisocial or violent behavior is known, with studies showing arrested teenagers were four times more likely to have elevated lead in their bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. While not solely responsible, lead likely contributed to some of the increase in crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

### Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality
One lesser-known effect of lead exposure is the hardening of arteries, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. A 2018 study estimated that lead was likely responsible for 250,000 heart disease deaths per year in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Over the past century, this could amount to 25 million deaths in the US alone, and potentially 100 million globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

## Legacy and Ongoing Challenges
Thanks to Clair Patterson's work, it became clear that environmental lead was largely due to human activity, especially the burning of lead in combustion engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Japan was the first country to ban [[the_controversy_and_consequences_of_leaded_gasoline | leaded gasoline]] in 1986, with Algeria being the last in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. The UN calculates that the elimination of lead from gasoline saves over a million lives and $2.45 trillion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

Despite these efforts, the problem is not entirely over. Current estimates suggest lead causes 500,000 to 900,000 deaths per year globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. A 2020 UNICEF report warned that over 800 million children globally have blood lead levels at or above five micrograms per deciliter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. While much of this lead now comes from batteries and industrial processes, some is still attributed to Midgley's invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. In the US, [[the_controversy_and_consequences_of_leaded_gasoline | leaded gasoline]] is still used in piston-driven airplane engines, making it the largest source of lead emissions into the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

Midgley is also credited with the invention of [[cfcs_and_their_environmental_effects | CFCs]] (chlorofluorocarbons), which were widely used as refrigerants (Freon) and aerosols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. These chemicals contributed to another major environmental disaster: the hole in the ozone layer, increasing rates of skin cancer and cataracts, and acting as potent greenhouse gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. An agreement to phase out [[cfcs_and_their_environmental_effects | CFCs]], the Montreal Protocol, went into effect in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

The lasting impact of Thomas Midgley Jr.'s inventions highlights a critical point articulated by Benjamin Franklin:

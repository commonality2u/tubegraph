For a long time, there was a significant [[misconceptions_in_classical_paths_versus_quantum_paths | misconception]] that every object has one single, predetermined trajectory through space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, in reality, everything is exploring all possible paths simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Classical Origins: Finding the Fastest Path

Consider a scenario where you need to rescue a friend struggling in the water from a beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The shortest path is a straight line, but since you can run faster than you can swim, this might not be the quickest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Conversely, running far down the beach minimizes swimming distance but increases total distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The optimal path, which minimizes travel time, is somewhere in between and depends on your running and swimming speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

This concept is identical to the law governing light passing from one medium to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Light also takes the fastest path from point A to point B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. For humans, it's easy to figure out the fastest route, but for light, it raises the question: "How does light know how to travel to minimize its journey time?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Initially, one might assume light travels in a single direction, changes direction due to local interactions with a medium, and coincidentally, this path happens to be the fastest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, this isn't the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Light, electrons, protons, and all [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum particles]] truly explore all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The perception of single, well-defined trajectories is an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## The Role of Action

The explanation for this phenomenon lies in a quantity called "action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

*   **Maupertuis's Proposal**: The concept was first proposed by Maupertuis, who, in an ad hoc manner, defined action as mass times velocity times distance, claiming that everything always follows the path that minimizes this action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Hamilton's Formulation**: Hamilton later showed that this action is equivalent to the integral over time of kinetic energy minus potential energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This [[Principle of Least Action]] became a useful alternative method for solving physics problems, especially when [[newtons_second_law_and_variational_principles | Newton's Laws]] became too cumbersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Action at the Heart of Quantum Mechanics

Around the turn of the 20th century, action became central to the birth of [[quantum_mechanics_and_wave_functions | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### The Ultraviolet Catastrophe

The initial problem that brought action into the quantum realm was understanding blackbody radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Scientists in Germany were studying how hot materials emitted visible light, aiming to maximize light output from hot filaments for electric lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. They observed that above 500°C, all materials glowed similarly, with the peak distribution of light shifting to shorter wavelengths as temperature increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

To understand this theoretically, they modeled a perfect blackbody (a hole in a metal cube) and reasoned that electrons in the walls would emit electromagnetic waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Inside the cavity, only standing waves survive, with shorter wavelengths allowing for more vibrational modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This led to the Rayleigh-Jeans law, which matched experimental data at longer wavelengths but predicted an infinite amount of energy emitted at the shortest wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This became known as the ultraviolet catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Planck's Quantum Hypothesis

Max Planck, despite being advised that physics was a complete science, tackled this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. In an "act of desperation," he tried restricting energy so it could only come in multiples of a smallest amount, a "quantum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. He proposed that the energy of one quantum was directly proportional to its frequency, expressed as E = hf, where 'h' is [[the_role_of_plancks_constant_in_quantum_mechanics | Planck's constant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This solved the ultraviolet catastrophe because at higher frequencies, the energy of a quantum becomes too large for all atoms to emit that wavelength, causing the spectrum to drop to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

Planck's constant 'h' has the units of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Planck later proposed that any change in nature would occur in whole multiples of this quantum of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

### Einstein and Quantization

In 1905, Albert Einstein supported Planck's theory, claiming that light truly comes in discrete packets, or photons, each with energy HF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. He used this to explain the photoelectric effect, where light ejects electrons from metal only if its frequency is high enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

### Bohr and De Broglie

Niels Bohr applied the idea of quantization to explain the stability of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Recognizing that angular momentum has the same units as action, he "discretized" the orbital angular momentum of electrons, allowing them to exist only in specific, quantized energy levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This condition, n*h-bar (nh/2π), surprisingly predicted the correct energy levels of the hydrogen atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

Eleven years later, [[de_broglies_hypothesis_and_waveparticle_duality | Louis de Broglie]] provided a physical reason for Bohr's quantization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. If light can be both a wave and a particle, then matter particles like electrons could also be waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. He proposed that everything has a wavelength, defined as Planck's constant divided by momentum (λ = h/mv) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. For an electron to remain bound in an atom, it must exist as a standing wave, meaning a whole number of wavelengths must fit around the circumference of its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. This condition (2πr = nλ) directly leads to Bohr's quantized angular momentum (mvr = n*h-bar), providing a fundamental reason for quantization based on the [[de_broglies_hypothesis_and_waveparticle_duality | wave nature of quantum objects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## [[Feynmans_path_integral_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics | Feynman's Path Integral Formulation of Quantum Mechanics]]

The wave nature of quantum objects means they do not follow a single path through space; instead, they explore all possible paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

### The Double-Slit Experiment Extended

This concept is vividly illustrated by imagining an extension of the double-slit experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. In the standard experiment, a particle (like an electron) goes through both slits simultaneously because its path cannot be definitively determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. To find the probability of the particle reaching a point on the screen, one adds the amplitudes of the wave going through each slit and squares the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

A thought experiment attributed to Richard Feynman (though possibly apocryphal) extends this: What if you add a third, fourth, or even infinite slits? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a> And what if you then add infinite screens, each with infinite slits, essentially making space itself an infinite series of potential paths? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a> The logic holds: the particle must explore all possible paths, including those that go faster than light, back in time, or even to the moon and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

### How Paths are Combined

According to Feynman, any particle moving from point 1 to point 2 has a chance to take *any* path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. All these paths are included in the calculation, each weighted the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

The key to understanding why we only see classical paths is how their amplitudes are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>:

1.  **Phase as a Stopwatch**: For each path, a "stopwatch" measures something called "phase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. As a particle wave follows a path, its phase increases, causing a vector to "wind around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
2.  **Phase and Action**: The change in phase for a path is directly determined by the classical action of that path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Specifically, the amplitude is e^(i * action/h-bar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
3.  **Constructive and Destructive Interference**:
    *   [[the_role_of_plancks_constant_in_quantum_mechanics | Planck's constant]] (h-bar) is incredibly tiny (10^-34 joule-seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.
    *   For everyday objects, the action of an ordinary path is vastly larger than h-bar, causing the phase to spin around zillions of times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. Even tiny deviations from a path result in huge phase changes, causing the "arrows" (amplitudes) for these paths to point in random directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. When summed, these random arrows largely cancel each other out, leading to destructive interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.
    *   However, for paths extremely close to the path of least action (or more generally, stationary action), tiny changes to the path result in negligible changes in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>. Consequently, their arrows point in nearly the same direction, leading to strong constructive interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. These are the paths we observe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

This explains how light "knows" where to go: it doesn't. It explores all paths, and the ones we see are those that constructively interfere because they correspond to the [[principle_of_least_action | Principle of Least Action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

### Experimental Demonstration

The concept can be demonstrated with a diffraction grating. Normally, light reflects off a mirror at a specific angle (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. However, if a mirror is covered with many tiny strips (like a diffraction grating with a thousand lines per millimeter), it effectively blocks out certain phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. By selectively cancelling out portions of the "crazy" paths, the sum of remaining amplitudes can cause light to reflect at unexpected angles, demonstrating that these "crazy" paths truly exist and are usually canceled out by destructive interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Fundamental Importance of Action

[[principle_of_least_action | The Principle of Least Action]] is how classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. A ball appears to follow a precise trajectory, and planets orbit the sun in well-defined paths, not because they have a single trajectory, but because they are massive particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Their actions are so large compared to [[the_role_of_plancks_constant_in_quantum_mechanics | h-bar]] that only paths extremely close to the true path of least action survive due to constructive interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. For smaller particles like electrons or photons, actions are smaller, allowing for a greater spread in possible trajectories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

Theoretical physicists often discuss "action" and "Lagrangians" (which determine the action) rather than energy or forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. The search for a "theory of everything" is essentially the hunt for a single Lagrangian that can generate all the laws of physics in our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. The [[principle_of_least_action | Principle of Least Action]] provides a single mathematical framework applicable across different areas of physics, from classical mechanics to special relativity and electrodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.

Airless tire technology represents a significant advancement in material science, offering extreme durability and performance without the need for air pressure. These tires utilize specialized metals, primarily [[physics_and_aerodynamic_principles | Nitinol]], a shape memory alloy, to overcome the limitations of traditional pneumatic tires, especially for demanding applications like space exploration and heavy-duty terrestrial vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Limitations of Traditional Tires

For space missions, traditional pneumatic tires present numerous challenges:
*   **Atmospheric Pressure** In environments with low or no atmospheric pressure, such as the Moon or Mars, rubber pneumatic tires can explode due to the lack of external confining pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Extreme Temperatures** Rubber becomes brittle at the extreme low temperatures encountered in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. For instance, the moon's surface can range from 250 degrees Fahrenheit above zero in sunlight to 250 degrees below zero in shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. At temperatures below its glass transition point (around 90 degrees Celsius for rubber), rubber transforms from flexible to rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, leading to catastrophic failure as demonstrated by rubber dipped in liquid nitrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Previous generations of wheels for space, like those on the Curiosity rover, were made of thin aluminum to meet mass limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. While lightweight, their 0.7-millimeter-thick skin (thinner than a credit card) proved susceptible to damage from aggressive terrain, resulting in holes and cracks due to concentrated peak loads between their structural grousers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

<div class="callout">
**Stress and Strain**
When a force (stress) is applied to a material, its atoms shift, causing deformation (strain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. For most materials, under low stress, strain is proportional to stress, and the material is elastic, returning to its original shape when stress is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. However, if stress exceeds the material's yield strength, atoms rearrange, leading to non-reversible plastic deformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Ordinary metals can only withstand 0.3% to 0.8% elastic strain before permanent deformation or fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

The Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) used wheels made of woven steel wires called a pantograph, with tread strips to prevent sinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. To minimize plastic deformation over short distances, these wheels incorporated an internal "bump stop" to limit strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. However, for longer missions, this approach is insufficient as steel mesh wheels degrade over time with accumulating plastic deformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Nitinol: The "Magic Metal"

The solution to these limitations lies in Nitinol, a [[physics_and_aerodynamic_principles | metal]] alloy of nickel and titanium, discovered in 1961 at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory (NOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Nitinol exhibits unique properties, making it behave "about as close to magic as it is possible to find in nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:

1.  **Shape Memory Effect**: Nitinol can return to a predefined shape after deformation upon heating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This occurs due to a solid-state phase change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>:
    *   **Austenite**: At high temperatures, atoms are in a cubic lattice arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
    *   **Twinned Martensite**: Upon cooling, atoms transition into a messier, lower-symmetry arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. In this phase, stress can deform the material.
    *   **Detwinned Martensite**: Applied stress transforms the crystal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Unlike ordinary metals, this deformation does not break atomic bonds but rather rearranges the crystal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
    *   **Heating and Recovery**: Heating the material returns it to the austenite phase, causing all atoms to revert to their original locations and the material to regain its original shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

    This effect allows Nitinol to generate significant forces when heated, making it useful as an actuator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The transition temperature between austenite and martensite can be tuned from -150 to 350 degrees Celsius by altering the element ratio and heat treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This property is explored for [[applications_in_aerospace_and_space_technology | aviation]], where shape memory alloys can autonomously control features like vortex generators on airplane wings based on ambient temperature changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

2.  **Superelasticity (Pseudoelasticity)**: Nitinol can stretch up to 8% of its length and still spring back to its original size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. This is significantly more than ordinary metals, which deform plastically beyond 0.3-0.8% strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Superelasticity occurs when Nitinol is in the austenite phase at a temperature higher than its martensite transition temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Applying stress forces a crystal structure change from austenite to detwinned martensite. When the stress is removed, the atoms return to the austenite phase, and the material recovers its original shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. This stress-induced phase change can be heard as a "pinging" sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

3.  **Elastocalorics**: The phase transformation in Nitinol also involves energy conversion between mechanical and thermal energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. When deformed, the material releases heat (exothermic), and when the stress is removed, it absorbs heat (endothermic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. This "elastocaloric" effect allows the tire itself to act as a damper or shock absorber, potentially leading to a complete suspension system built into the tire, simplifying vehicle design for space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

## [[nasa_wheel_innovations | NASA]]'s Spring Tire Technology

[[nasa_wheel_innovations | NASA]]'s innovative airless tires utilize Nitinol springs woven into a mesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. The core concept began with a "slinky applied to the rim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, demonstrating how a flexible metallic structure could provide both support and shock absorption without air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Key Features and Benefits

*   **Puncture Proof**: The tires do not rely on air pressure, making them immune to punctures. This was demonstrated by driving a bicycle with these tires over a bed of nails with no loss of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. They can even withstand a bullet shot directly through the tire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Extreme Flexibility and Durability**: The superelasticity of Nitinol allows the tire to deform up to 8% without permanent damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>, far exceeding the elastic limits of ordinary metals. This is crucial for navigating aggressive and unpredictable terrain on other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Load Carrying Capacity**: By integrating elements that distribute load circumferentially around the tire (similar to adapting the "bump stop" concept), the tires can significantly increase their load-carrying capacity without adding mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

### Testing

These tires are extensively tested at [[nasa_wheel_innovations | NASA]] Glenn Research Center using a terrain endurance rig, a circular carousel that simulates various terrain types, including sand and rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. This allows for rigorous evaluation under conditions mimicking lunar and Martian surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

## Applications

While initially developed for [[applications_in_aerospace_and_space_technology | space technology]] and missions to the Moon and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, [[nasa_wheel_innovations | NASA]]'s airless tire technology has significant terrestrial applications:
*   **Bicycles**: Airless tires have been developed for bicycles, offering puncture-proof performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Automotive**: Testing on a Jeep has shown that these tires eliminate flats and significantly improve fuel economy by always maintaining optimal inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.
*   **Aircraft**: Current aircraft tires are pressurized to very high levels (300-400 psi), leading to explosion risks and high maintenance demands for checking air pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. Airless structural systems for aircraft tires would eliminate these issues, reducing maintenance and improving safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

By leveraging the "magic" properties of Nitinol, airless tires promise a future of durable, maintenance-free, and high-performance mobility across diverse environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

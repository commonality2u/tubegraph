The "Secretary Problem" is a mathematical problem that offers an optimal strategy for [[strategies for imperfect information and noisy environments | decision making]] when faced with a sequence of choices where each decision is immediate and final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This problem is also known as the "marriage problem" or the "hiring problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

## Problem Definition
In scenarios described by the secretary problem, you cannot assess all available options simultaneously before making a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Instead, with each option encountered, you must decide whether to accept it or reject it permanently to see what comes next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Examples include deciding whether to rent an apartment after a single tour, accepting a job offer, or stopping at the next gas station on a road trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

The challenge lies in avoiding two pitfalls:
*   **Selecting too early:** You might miss out on the best possible option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Selecting too late:** You might have already rejected the best option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

The optimal strategy suggests that the best choice lies somewhere in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Optimal Strategy
The optimal strategy for the secretary problem involves a two-phase approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>:

1.  **Exploration Phase:** You must first examine and automatically reject a certain percentage of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. The purpose of this phase is to gain information and understand the range and quality of available choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
2.  **Selection Phase:** After this initial exploration period, at a specific "stopping point" (S), you cease rejecting options automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. From this point onward, you select the very first option that is better than all the options you have seen so far during the exploration phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

### The 37% Rule
The mathematical solution to maximize the chances of picking the single best option dictates that the optimal stopping point (S) should be when you have explored approximately 37% of the total available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This percentage is derived from the mathematical constant *e* (specifically, `1/e`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. By following this strategy, your chances of successfully selecting the best option are also approximately 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

## Practical Application
While it can be challenging to know the exact total number of candidates or options (N) in real-world scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>, the 37% rule can also be applied to time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. For example, if you aim to make a significant life decision, like getting married, within a 10-year period, the optimal strategy suggests spending the first 3.7 years exploring options without committing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. After this period, you would select the next person encountered who is better than anyone you've met previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

It has been suggested that people subconsciously recognize the importance of 37 in such decision-making processes, which might explain why it's a frequently chosen "random" number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. This phenomenon highlights a potential link between human intuition and mathematical optimization in various aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
